495630,10030,Hexanchus griseus,Near Threatened,A2bd,2020,2019-11-21 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<p>The&#160;Bluntnose Sixgill Shark (<em>Hexanchus griseus</em>)&#160;is a large (to 550 cm total length) deep-water shark known with a global yet patchy distribution. It occurs in tropical, temperate and boreal&#160;waters off continental slopes and shelves, and occasionally inshore at depths of 0–2,490 m, but mostly at depths of 200–1,100 m.&#160;It has large litters but an estimated late age-at-maturity that reduces its capacity to recover from fishing pressure. The species is infrequently caught incidentally in deep-water industrial and artisanal&#160; fisheries across its range.&#160;There is high distribution overlap with intensive fishing pressure, reported declines in part of its range and increases in others, and a lack of species-specific management across its entire range.&#160;The Bluntnose Sixgill Shark&#160;is estimated to have undergone a population reduction of 20–29%&#160;over the past three generations (160 years) based on abundance data and actual levels of exploitation, and it is assessed as&#160;Near Threatened (close to meeting Vulnerable&#160;A2bd).</p><strong><br/></strong>","<p><span lang=""EN-GB""><span lang=""EN-GB"">The Bluntnose Sixgill Shark is&#160;demersal in tropical, temperate and boreal waters on the slope, shelf, and occasionally inshore at depths of 0–2,490 m, but mostly 200–1,100 m&#160;(Ebert <em>et al.</em> 2013, Griffing <em>et al.</em> 2014, Weigmann 2016).&#160;It also occurs on seamounts and mid-ocean ridges and is often associated areas of high biological productivity and upwelling (Ebert <em>et al.</em> 2013). It reaches a maximum size of 550 cm total length (TL) (Weigmann 2016); males mature at ~309–330 cm TL and females mature at 350–420 cm TL (Ebert <em>et al. </em>2013).&#160;Reproduction is aplacental viviparous&#160;with litter sizes of 47–108, and size-at-birth is estimated at 61–74 cm TL (Ebert <em>et al</em>. 2013)<a>. Female age-at-maturity is estimated at 26.5 years and maximum age is estimated at 80 years (COSEWIC 2007), resulting in a generation length of 53 years. This study has not been validated and estimates should be used with caution.&#160;</a></span></p>","<p>The Bluntnose Sixgill Shark&#160;is infrequently reported as targeted and incidental catch from industrial and artisanal demersal trawl, longline, handline, traps, and gillnet fisheries across its range (e.g. Celona <em>et al</em>. 2005, White and Dharmadi 2010, Fisheries and Oceans Canada 2012, Akhilesh and Ganga 2013, da Silva <em>et al</em>. 2015, S. Tanaka unpubl. data 2019). The species is also targeted by recreational fishers (Fisheries and Oceans Canada 2012, da Silva<em> et al.</em> 2015). <br/><br/>In the Northeast Atlantic, despite a number of management measures to reduce deep-water shark fishing mortality, the species is still captured in considerable quantities in demersal fisheries (e.g. Fauconnet&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2019). Post-release mortality for the species is likely to be low (Ellis <em>et al</em>. 2017), and the species is mostly discarded (Silva and Ellis 2019). <br/><br/>Off southeast Australia, the species has been regularly reported from demersal trawl and longline fisheries at depths of 200–600 m (Walker and Gason 2007). In the Australian Southern and Eastern Scalefish and Shark Fishery (SESSF), total shark catches from the eastern and western deep-water shark fisheries peaked in 1998 at 330 t and 400 t, respectively, before declining to &lt;25 t in each zone by 2007 (Patterson <em>et al.</em> 2018).&#160;A semi-quantitative risk assessment for chondrichthyan bycatch species taken in the SESSF ranked this species with medium risk from current commercial&#160;fishing as fishing effort has been reduced and the species likely has some refuge at depth&#160;(T. Walker unpubl. data 2019).&#160;</p><p><br/></p>","<p>Species-specific population trend data are available from nominal catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) and relative biomass in the Northeast Atlantic (ICES-WGEF 2018, F. Neat unpubl. data 2019). The trend data were analyzed over three generation lengths (160 years) using a Bayesian state-space framework (Winker <em>et al</em>. 2020). This analysis yields an annual rate of change, a median change over three generation lengths, and the probability of the most likely IUCN Red List category percent change over three generations (see the Supplementary Information). <br/><br/>The trend analysis of the CPUE and relative abundance estimates from the Northeast Atlantic over 21 years between 1998–2018 (ICES-WGEF 2018, F. Neat unpubl. data 2019) revealed an annual rate of increase of 1.4%, consistent with an estimated increase of 80.4% over three generation lengths (160 years), with the highest probability of no major reductions in population over the past three generation lengths. <br/><br/>In the Northeast Pacific, video surveillance and dive encounter rates in the Strait of Georgia showed large declines in sightings between 1999–2005 (COSEWIC 2007). A decline is sightings were also reported from Elliott Bay, Puget Sound between 2003–2005 and 2008–2015 (Griffing <em>et al. 2</em>019). However, these observed declines are not thought to be representative of true reduction in population and may be attributed to environmental or behavioural factors, or natural variability of juvenile recruitment (COSEWIC 2007, Griffing <em>et al</em>. 2019). Genetic studies in Puget Sound suggest the local stock is fairly large (Larson&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2010), but there is apparent cohort-specific, broad variation in abundance (Williams&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2010). <br/><br/>In the Arabian Seas, the species was targeted in the deep-water fisheries in the Maldives before stocks collapsed and were replaced with a fishery for gulper sharks (<em>Centrophorus</em>&#160;spp) (Anderson and Ahmed 1993, Ali 2015). The gulper shark fishery also collapsed over a short period of time (20 years) (Ali 2015); while there are no data available, the rapid decline of the gulper shark fishery may be indicative of the duration of the former targeted fishery for the Bluntnose Sixgill Shark prior to the collapse of stocks. <br/><br/>In the Indo-Pacific, abundance indices from CPUE data of the species landed at Cilacap-Central Java and Tanjung Luar, Indonesia show no trends between 2014–2018, but only a small number of individuals were caught&#160;(Dharmadi unpubl. data 2019). <br/><br/>The species is infrequently reported across much of its range including past and/or present targeted shark fisheries in the Northeast Atlantic (ICES-WGEF 2018), the Mediterranean (Ferretti&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2005), east and west Africa (Fernández<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2005, Georgeson&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2019), India (K.K. Bineesh unpubl. data 2019), Indonesia (Blaber<em>&#160;et al.&#160;</em>2009,&#160;White and Dharmadi 2010),&#160;and Australia (Graham&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2001,&#160;Walker and Gason 2007).&#160;It is likely to have some refuge at depth in parts of its range. Based on documented declines in part of its range (Maldives) and increasing trends in others (Northeast Atlantic), overlap with fishing pressure and refuge at depth, a global population reduction of 20–29% was estimated over three generation lengths (160 years). Therefore, the Bluntnose Sixgill&#160;Shark&#160;is assessed as Near Threatened (close to meeting Vulnerable&#160;A2bd).</p>",Decreasing,"The Bluntnose Sixgill Shark has a widespread, yet patchy, distribution across all oceans&#160;(Ebert <em>et al.</em> 2013).<p><br/></p><p><strong></strong></p>","<p>The species is utilized for its meat, liver oil, cartilage, and fish meal (Anderson and Ahmed 1993, Last and Stevens 2009, Akhilesh and Ganga&#160;2013). In the early 20th century, the species was also utilized for its leather (Fisheries and Oceans Canada 2012). Given its large size, its meat, fins, and liver oil can fetch high market prices in some places (Dharmadi unpubl. data 2019). Its fins have been reported in the international fin trade in low quantities (Fields<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2018).</p><p><br/></p>",Marine,"<p>Since 2010, the European Union Fisheries Council prohibited direct fishing for deep-water sharks, including the Bluntnose Sixgill Shark, in European Community and international waters, and in 2012, no allowances for bycatch were implemented (ICES-WGEF 2018). In 2017 and 2018, a restrictive bycatch allowance (10 t) was trialled, permitting limited landings of unavoidable catches of deep-water sharks in directed artisanal demersal longline fisheries for Black Scabbardfish&#160;(<em>Aphanopus&#160;</em>spp).&#160;Additional management actions for this region include banned use of trawls and gillnets in waters &gt;200 m in Azores, Madeira and Canary Islands and international waters regulated by ICES (NEAFC regulatory Area); banned use of gillnets by European Union vessels at depths &gt;600 m; maximum bycatch limits of deep-water shark in Hake (<em>Merluccius merluccius</em>) and Monkfish (<em>Lophius&#160;</em>spp) gillnet catches; area restrictions by vessel size and gear, gear restrictions (hook size, maximum number of hooks on longline gear), and a network of closed areas in Azorean waters; closure of the Condor seamount to deep-water fishing in 2010 (ICES-WGEF 2018). In addition, the General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean (GFCM) banned bottom trawling below depths of &gt;1,000 m in the Mediterranean Sea in 2005. <br/><br/>The Maldives has a general ban on shark fishing since 1998 which affords this deep-sea species protection from fisheries exploitation within that range (<a>Ali</a>&#160;2015). Conservation measures are generally lacking elsewhere in the species' patchy range. In Canada, the Bluntnose Sixgill Shark is listed as a species of Special Concern under the&#160;Species at Risk Act (SARA) in 2009 and by&#160;the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC) in 2007 and a management plan under SARA was developed to ensure the recovery and conservation of the species (Fisheries and Oceans Canada 2012).&#160;Further research is needed on population size and trends of the species, and catches should be monitored.</p><p></p>","",,false,false,Global
887942,161403,Somniosus pacificus,Near Threatened,A2bd,2021,2019-08-29 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The Pacific Sleeper Shark (<em>Somniosus pacificus</em>) is a large (to 700 cm total length) deep-water sleeper shark that occurs in the North Pacific Ocean from Taiwan, north to the Chukchi Sea, in the Arctic and across the Pacific, including the Hawaiian Islands, to Baja California, Mexico. It is demersal and pelagic on the continental shelf and slope at depths of 0–2,008 m. The species is caught as bycatch in industrial fisheries with multiple fishing gears including demersal and pelagic trawl and longline and is usually discarded, though may be retained for the liver oil, and for the meat in Taiwan. The species is occasionally observed in Japan and is now rarely captured in Taiwan, with a possible decline over the past 18 years. Russian survey data suggest catches have increased slightly over the past 40 years across the Sea of Okhotsk, Bering Sea, and Northwest Pacific. In the Northeast Pacific, the catch estimate trend is uncertain; the relative abundance may have declined over the past 21 years; however, the observed decline may be due to a reduction in catchability. Mainly immature animals are captured across its range, with fewer adults encountered which suggests either most adults have refuge from fishing pressure at depth or they occur in nearshore habitats but are not susceptible to capture in fishing gear, possibly due to their large size. Large individuals are commonly seen on deep-water videos in Monterey Bay and Baja California. It is still considered common in parts of its western range and in the eastern range, the stock is not considered to be currently subject to overfishing. The species is unlikely to have been threatened for approximately half of the past three generation lengths (150–225 years), however it may have undergone some population reduction in the past 80 years (~1–1.5 generation lengths) due to fisheries exploitation. Taking a precautionary approach, and given its large size and likely low productivity, it is suspected that the Pacific Sleeper Shark has undergone a population reduction of 20–29% over the past three generation lengths (150–225 years) due to fisheries exploitation, and it is assessed as Near Threatened A2bd.","The Pacific Sleeper Shark is demersal and pelagic on the continental shelf and slope at depths of 0–2,008 m (Weigmann 2016). At high latitudes with cold surface waters, it ranges into the littoral and even the intertidal (one large individual was found trapped in a tide pool) as well as at the surface; however, in lower latitudes with temperate water it becomes a deep-water, epibenthic shark, never coming to the surface and ranging to a depth of 2,008 m in the extreme southern end of its range (off Baja California) (Compagno 1984). Tagging studies in the Northeast Pacific showed some Pacific Sleeper Sharks undertake regular diurnal vertical migrations from below the photic zone during the day to near the surface at night (Hulbert <em>et al</em>. 2006). It reaches an estimated maximum size of 700 cm total length (TL), males mature at 385 cm TL and females mature at 365 cm TL (Ebert <em>et al</em>. 1987, Wang and Yang 2004, Yano <em>et</em> <em>al</em>. 2007, Ebert <em>et al</em>. 2013a). Reproduction is probably viviparous with a size-at-birth estimated at 40 cm TL (Yano <em>et al</em>. 2007). Age parameters are unknown, and it is likely that the generation length is similar to that of the Greenland Shark which is suspected of a generation length similar to other deep-water sharks, that is, 50–75 years (Kulka <em>et al</em>. 2020).","The Pacific Sleeper Shark is caught as bycatch in industrial fisheries with multiple fishing gears including demersal and pelagic trawl and longline and is usually discarded. Post-release mortality is unknown but has been conservatively estimated as 100% (Tribuzio <em>et al</em>. 2020a). It is captured in recreational fisheries in the Southeast and Southcentral Alaska, however the catch is uncommon and rarely retained (Tribuzio <em>et al</em>. 2020a).<br/><br/>In Taiwan, shark fishing has a long history with sharks historically targeted by trawl and longline fisheries from the late 1920s when 6,000 t was landed annually (Chen et al. 1997). Most fisheries subsequently moved to taking shark as bycatch, except for some vessels that continued to target shark in the east and northeast of Taiwan up until at least the late 1990s; the gears included demersal longlines set at depths of 80–200 m, mid-water longline, and large-mesh drift nets (till 1992 when they were prohibited in Taiwan) (Chen <em>et al</em>. 1997).<br/><br/>In Japan, prior to World War I, fisheries from the early 1800s targeted mainly Pacific Salmon (<em>Oncorhynchus </em>spp.) and in the Bering Sea, they mainly operated in the waters above the continental shelf and slope of the Bering Sea (Hayashi 1991). Fisheries developed rapidly in Japan during the 1950s–1980s, however they began to decline in the 1980s–1990s with a reduction in fish prices and the establishment of the Japan 200 nautical mile Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) (Swartz and Ishimura 2014, White Paper 2015). Deep-water trawl fisheries across Japan mostly operate at 200–800 m but in some parts of northern Japan, they operate to 1,500 m. Deep-water longline fisheries mostly operate at depths of 400–800 m (A. Yamaguchi unpubl. data 2019).<br/><br/>Russian survey catch data from 1980 to 2014 indicated this species was caught in the Bering Sea, Sea of Okhotsk, and in the Pacific Ocean with demersal and mid-water trawls with catches ranging from 1 to 67 individuals per trawl and a total of 798 individuals captured over the 35 years (I. Volvenko unpubl data 2019). In Russia, prior to World War I, fisheries mostly operated in inland waters. During the 1930s, fisheries gradually shifted to coastal waters and expanded to marine waters and foreign fleets during the late 1940s to early 1950s with fishing in the Sea of Japan, Sea of Okhotsk, and western Bering Sea and further in the 1960s to the eastern Bering Sea, Aleutian Islands, and Gulf of Alaska targeting herring and bottom fish with large, factory stern trawlers (Pruter 1976).<br/><br/>In the Northeast Pacific, from 1860 to 1920, fisheries mostly targeted Salmon (<em>Oncorhynchus </em>spp.) with pelagic fisheries increasing in effort between World War I and II and sharks (Squaliformes) a minor component of the catch (Diemling <em>et al</em>. 1994). In the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands (BSAI), Pacific Sleeper Shark are now captured mainly in the Pacific Cod (<em>Gadus macrocephalus</em>) longline and the Walleye Pollock (<em>Gadus chalcogrammus</em>) trawl fisheries (Tribuzio <em>et al</em>. 2020b). In the Gulf of Alaska, the species is mainly captured in the flatfish fisheries and Pacific Halibut (<em>Hippoglossus stenolepis</em>) longline fisheries (Tribuzio <em>et al</em>. 2020a).<br/><br/>The species may be caught as bycatch on the Emperor Seamounts. The fisheries have operated since 1967 and fished heavily during the 1960s to 1980s mostly at depths of 300–600 m (Baco <em>et al</em>. 2019). The fisheries currently operate mostly in the Southern Emperor seamounts at depths of 300–500 m. However, some Japanese gillnets may operate at 300–1,300 m and an exploratory South Korea longliner operated at depths of 250–1,050 m in the mid-2000s (CHM 2016, Shotton 2016, NPFC 2020). The demersal trawl fisheries mainly target North Pacific Armourhead (<em>Pentaceros wheeleri</em>) that do not occur below depths of 800 m and Splendid Alfosino (<em>Beryx splendens</em>) that occurs at depths of 25–1,300 m (Froese and Pauly 2019, NPFC 2020).<span><span

Sleeper Shark catches across the North Pacific from the Sea of Okhotsk to the United States west coast are mostly of small and immature animals (50–200 cm total length, TL) with fewer captures of individuals &gt;200 cm TL reported. Occasional catches of animals up to 400 cm TL have been reported from the Gulf of Alaska (GOA) and United States west coast (Tribuzio <em>et al</em>. 2020a), and large individuals are commonly seen on deep-water videos in Monterey Bay, off California and off Baja California (D.A. Ebert unpubl. data 2021). The lesser number of large and mature animals captured in industrial fisheries and research surveys suggests that most adults inhabit depths beyond the reach of industrial and survey fishing gear or that the adults occur in nearshore habitats but are less susceptible to capture in the gear than smaller individuals (Tribuzio <em>et al</em>. 2020a).<br/><br/>In Japan, this species is sometimes observed on deep-water bait cameras in Suruga Bay and Sagami Bay (S. Tanaka unpubl. data 2019). In Taiwan, this species was caught previously caught in a small, localised deep-water longline fishery till 2002, but is now a rare bycatch with the decline in catches of concern, particularly as most of the catch was of large sub-adults and adults &gt;200 cm TL (Ebert <em>et al</em>. 2013b. H. Hsu unpubl. data 2019). Russian survey data suggest catches of the Pacific Sleeper Shark have increased slightly across the Sea of Okhotsk, Bering Sea, and Northwest Pacific from 1980 to 2019, in terms of both abundance and biomass (I. Volvenko unpubl. data 2019). The species is considered common in the southeast of Sakhalin Island (Dyldin and Orlov 2018).<br/><br/>In the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands (BSAI) and in the GOA, the Pacific Sleeper Shark is not considered to be currently subject to overfishing (Tribuzio <em>et al</em>. 2020a,b). There are no data to determine if the stock is overfished (Tribuzio <em>et al</em>. 2020b). Pacific Sleeper Shark catch in the BSAI was estimated to have averaged 136 t annually for 2003–2020; the method of catch estimation changed in 2003 and catch estimations prior to that were based on limited data (Tribuzio <em>et al</em>. 2020b). The species' catch in the GOA was estimated to have averaged 199 t annually from 1997 to 2020; the same change in catch estimation methods occurred in the GOA in 2003, however GOA catch estimates are informed by more data prior to 2003 (Tribuzio <em>et al</em>. 2020a). There may be underestimation of estimated weights of Pacific Sleeper Shark captured in the BSAI and GOA from longline vessels, as weights based on observer data are generally from smaller individuals because animals &gt;50 kg cannot be weighed at sea and are difficult to bring on board (Tribuzio <em>et al</em>. 2020a). Trawl survey indices of relative abundance of Pacific Sleeper Sharks are less reliable than longline survey estimates as even immature animals are large and mostly avoid trawl gear and catches are often based on a small number of trawls and small numbers of individuals within a trawl; hence trawl estimates are not considered a reliable index for this species (Tribuzio <em>et al</em>. 2020a). The catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE, numbers caught per effective hook) from the International Pacific Halibut Commission annual longline surveys in the BSAI and GOA declined over 24 years from 1997 to 2020 (Tribuzio <em>et al</em>. 2020a, IPHC 2020). Catches were lower in Canada and the United States west coast and no CPUE trends in those areas were evident (Tribuzio <em>et al</em>. 2020a). The decline observed in the BSAI and GOA indicated that either abundance was declining or that the distribution of the Pacific Sleeper Sharks may have altered over time making them less available to capture (Tribuzio et al. 2020a). Despite the potential decline in abundance and uncertainty in catch estimates, overall current catches of this species in both the BSAI and GOA are considered well below the acceptable biological catch levels (Tribuzio <em>et al</em>. 2020a,b).<br/><br/>Overall, the species is occasionally observed in Japan and now rarely captured in Taiwan with possible declines over the past 18 years. The population is estimated to have increased slightly over the past 40 years in the Northwest Pacific, and in the Northeast Pacific the population trend is uncertain; the population may have declined over the past 21 years, however the observed decline in CPUE may be due to a reduction in catchability. Catches of the Pacific Sleeper Shark across the North Pacific are mostly of small and immature animals, with fewer adults captured which suggests either most adults have refuge from fishing pressure at depth or that they occur in nearshore habitats but are not susceptible to capture in the gear, possibly due to their large size. The threats to the species appear to have commenced during the 1940s (1–1.5 generation lengths ago) and it previously was estimated to have increased in biomass in the western Bering Sea from 1999 to 2006 with fluctuations in the eastern Bering Sea possibly due to sampling changes or species movements rather than population changes (Ebert <em>et al</em>. 2009). It is still considered common in parts of its western range and in the eastern range, the stock is not considered to be currently subject to overfishing. The species is unlikely to have been threatened for approximately half of the past three generation lengths (150–225 years), however it may have undergone some population reduction in the past 80 years (~1–1.5 generation lengths) due to fisheries exploitation. Taking a precautionary approach, and given its large size and likely low productivity as it is a deep-water species, it is suspected that the population has undergone a population reduction of 20–29% over the past three generation lengths (150–225 years) due to fisheries exploitation.<span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>",Decreasing,"The Pacific Sleeper Shark occurs in the North Pacific in the Northwest, Northeast, and Eastern Central Pacific from Taiwan to Baja California, Mexico, including the Hawaiian Islands. It also occurs north to the Chukchi Sea, in the Arctic Sea (Ebert <em>et al</em>. 2013a, Kang <em>et al</em>. 2015, Tribuzio <em>et al</em>. 2020a). Its distribution above the Arctic Circle is unclear, and it may be misidentified with the Greenland Shark (<em>S. microcephalus</em>). Large sleeper sharks identified as the Pacific Sleeper Shark from the Southern Hemisphere are most likely that of Southern Sleeper Shark (<em>S. antarcticus</em>) (Ebert 2003, Yano <em>et al</em>. 2004).","The liver oil is used but in most places the meat is not used as it contains toxins, similar to that of the Greenland Shark (Dyldin and Orlov 2018). Despite the toxins, the meat of this species is consumed fresh in Taiwan as a replacement for Whale Shark (<em>Rhincodon typus</em>) meat as it has a similar consistency (Wang and Yang 2004).",Marine,"In the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands (BSAI) and in the Gulf of Alaska (GOA), the Sleeper Shark has been managed since 2011 as part of the shark stock complex that includes the Spiny Dogfish (<em>Squalus suckleyi</em>) and the Salmon Shark (<em>Lamna ditropis</em>) under the BSAI and GOA Fishery Management Plans; a total allowable catch, accepted biological catch, and overfishing limits are set and revised biennially for the stock complex (Tribuzio <em>et al</em>. 2020a,b). The recreational fishing limit in the State of Alaska for combined Lamniformes, Carcharhiniformes, and Squaliformes is a daily bag limit of one shark with an annual limit of two sharks per year (Tribuzio <em>et al</em>. 2020a).<br/><br/>Elsewhere, there are no species-specific measures. In Japan, management measures have been implemented since the mid-1990s to control fishing effort that include total allowable catches, seasonal closures, and gear restrictions (White Paper 2015). In Taiwan, since 1999, all demersal trawling is prohibited within 3 nautical miles (nm) of the coast and within 12 nm for trawlers larger than 50 Gross Registered Tonnage (Fisheries Agency 2019, Liao <em>et al</em>. 2019). Demersal fisheries in the Emperor Seamount Chain are managed by interim conservation measures of the North Pacific Fisheries Commission (NPFC) and voluntary measures of NPFC Members, that include time-area closures, effort controls, and capacity limits (CHM 2016). Throughout the main Hawaiian Islands, there are a series of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) referred to as Bottomfish Restricted Fishing Areas (DLNR 2019). These are generally closed to industrial and recreational bottom fishing and may offer the species refuge. Further research is needed on population size and trend, and life history, and catch rates should be monitored.<br/><strong></strong><strong></strong><strong></strong><strong></strong>","",,false,false,Global
896169,161731,Pteroplatytrygon violacea,Least Concern,,2019,2018-11-09 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The Pelagic Stingray (<em>Pteroplatytrygon violacea</em>) is a medium-sized ray (to 80 cm disc width) that is circumglobal throughout the tropical and temperate oceans and is perhaps the only stingray to inhabit open ocean waters. It occurs in the epipelagic zone mostly to depths of 100 m, although it has been recorded to 381 m. The species is taken as bycatch in pelagic longline fisheries around the  world. It is&#160;mostly discarded, but is retained and utilized in some areas. Post-discard survival rates are thought to be low in  some regions where the species are often discarded with jaw damage. Relative abundance trends across the world appear to fluctuate over time with no consistent significant trend. In general, abundance trends appear to be stable or increasing in some regions, although recent data from US pelagic fisheries observers from the Western North Atlantic over the period 2004–2015 indicated a decline of 40%. While this trend is not considered representative of the global trend, it does suggest some caution is needed. Given the species' widespread occurrence and apparent resilience to fisheries, it is assessed as Least Concern at this time, with the caveat that catches should continue to be monitored.","The Pelagic Stingray is perhaps the only species of stingray that occurs in the pelagic zone (Last and Stevens 2009). It is usually found from the surface to 100 m<em> </em>depth over deep water, but has been reported to 381 m (Mollet 2002, Weigmann 2016). It reaches a maximum size of 90 cm disc width (DW); females mature at 39–50 cm DW; and males mature at 35–41 cm DW (Junior and Rotundo 2012, Veras <em>et al. </em>2014, Last&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2016). Reproduction is viviparous with litter sizes of 2–13 and size at birth of 14–24 cm DW (Wilson and  Beckett 1970, Mollet 2002, Mollet <em>et al. </em>2002, Forselledo <em>et al.</em> 2008, Neer 2008, Veras <em>et al.</em> 2014, Last <em>et al. </em>2016). Females mature at 3 years; males mature at 2 years; and maximum age is about 10  years; generation length is therefore 6.5 years (Wilson and  Beckett 1970, Mollet <em>et al.</em> 2002, Neer 2008).","The major threat to the Pelagic Stingray are pelagic longline fisheries for tunas, billfishes, and pelagic sharks (Neer 2008). This species is caught frequently by tuna and swordfish longliners and to a lesser extent other gear, including pelagic gillnets and trawls (Hemida&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2003).  In the Atlantic, between 2008 and 2011, the species was the fifth most  commonly captured bycatch species on longline vessels targeting  swordfish (<em><span class=""st"">Xiphias gladius</em>) (Coelho <em>et al.</em> 2012). It is of low commercial value and mostly discarded, although it is retained and utilized in some areas (Mollet 2002, Domingo&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2005,&#160;White&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2006, Forselledo <em>et al.</em> 2008, Baez <em>et al</em>. 2015). In some regions, such as the South Atlantic and Europe, there is a low discard survival  rate due to damage to jaws as a result of treatment on-board fishing vessels (Domingo <em>et al.</em> 2005, Forselledo <em>et al.</em> 2007). Variable catches are reported globally, for example, approximately 2,000 individuals were captured over 5 years to 2005 by the Uruguayan longline fleet in the south Atlantic and 57,500 individuals taken by the Spanish longline fleet in the Mediterranean over 13 years to 2013 (<em></em>Domingo <em>et al.</em> 2005, Forselledo <em>et al.</em> 2007, Baez&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;2015).","Relative abundance trends across the distribution of the species appear to fluctuate over time with no consistent significant increase or decrease, with variability evident between datasets. A study in the tropical Pacific Ocean comparing research surveys   conducted with pelagic longlines in the 1950s with 1990s observer data from the commercial pelagic longline fishery suggested that Pelagic Stingrays have increased in the region (Ward and Myers 2005).<em>&#160;</em>A similar analysis from pelagic longline data in the Gulf of Mexico suggests that there may have been an increase in Pelagic Stingrays in that region (unpubl. data in Baum <em>et al.</em> 2009)<em style="""">.</em>&#160;Comparisons in these studies were across different areas, fishing methods, and times of day which could contribute to the apparent changes in abundance of Pelagic Stingrays over time.&#160;The <span class=""st"">data from US pelagic fisheries observers from the Western North Atlantic over the period 2004–2015 (12 years) (J. Carlson unpubl. data) were analysed over three generation lengths (18 years) using a Bayesian state-space framework (a modification of Winker&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2018), which indicated a decline of 40.2% <span class=""st""> (see the Supplementary Information). While this trend is not considered representative of the global trend, it does suggest some caution is needed and catches need to be monitored.<br/><br/>In the Western Pacific Ocean, the catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) was variable from 1995–2015 for both longline and purse seine fleets that exhibited similar fluctuating declines and increases with no significant trend (Tremblay-Boyer and Brouwer 2016). In the South Atlantic, annual CPUE for the Uruguayan longline fleet operating between 2000 and 2006, varied from 0.27 to 1.2 individuals per 1,000 hooks, with no  significant trend  (Forselledo <em>et al. </em>2007). In the South Atlantic, large aggregations are  captured in some areas,  resulting in highly variable CPUE values (Forselledo <em>et al. </em> 2007). In the Mediterranean, the variable CPUE of the Spanish longline fleet during 2000–2013 ranged from 3–14 individuals/1,000 hooks and was correlated with the climatic variability driven by the North Atlantic Oscillation (Baez <em>et al. </em>2015).<br/><br/>In the Western Indian Ocean, this species is a common bycatch in tuna longline fisheries (E. Romanov unpubl. data) and&#160;abundance appears to be stable or increasing after a period of decline until the late 1980s. From 1964 to 1988, the hooking rate declined from 5 to 2 individuals per 1,000 hooks. More recently the species has anecdotally become more abundant, possibly due to mesopredator release as a result of declines in sharks and billfishes (E. Romanov unpubl. data). It occurs very commonly in Indian tuna fisheries (Somvanshi<em>&#160;et al.&#160;</em>2009, Varghese<em> et al. </em>2013) and there are no signs of decline in these fisheries (K.V. Akhilesh pers. comm. 10/02/2017). It is caught very commonly in Pakistani pelagic gillnet fisheries but is typically released alive, and there are no signs of decline (M.

This species has been found to migrate extensively, even across the Pacific Ocean Basin, but there are relatively isolated stocks in Puget Sound (Washington, U.S.) and Strait of Georgia (British Columbia, Canada). Small target fisheries for this species are present in three different countries, as well as non-target catch and discards that are poorly known, underestimated, or completely unaccounted for. This species has life history characteristics that make it highly sensitive to over-exploitation including late maturity (~36 years for females), slow intrinsic growth rate (0.031–0.044 yr<sup>-1</sup>), low reproductive capacity, and high longevity (80 or more years). The gestation period of 18–24 months is the longest known for vertebrates. This species segregates by both size and sex, making some members of its population (mature females) more accessible to fishing by trawl and bottom longline, which are the main fisheries that exist in its range. Some fisheries management exists in a limited portion of the range for the North Pacific Spiny Dogfish, but since this species is highly migratory, all countries and states must coordinate management of shared stocks for it to be effective. Multiple stocks have been identified but due to the absence of genetic differences among the stocks, they were assessed as one population.<br/><br/>In summary, the Northeast Pacific offshore stock is not overfished, and is possibly increasing based on the recent stock assessments. The Puget Sound inshore stock has historically been intensely fished but currently has relatively minor fisheries exploitation. The Strait of Georgia inshore stock has been categorized as being in a ‘cautious’ state, but currently, only around half of the recommended Total Allowable Catch (TAC) is used. North Pacific Spiny Dogfish in Alaska are stable or increasing. The status of the North Pacific Spiny Dogfish in the Northwest Pacific (Japan, Korea, Russia) is not as well known, but does not seem to be decreasing. In Japan, this species was historically fished and has remained at low levels, but the current fishing effort is low.<br/><br/>Considering that data indicate North Pacific Spiny Dogfish in different areas of the North Pacific Ocean basin have no genetic differences, that the fishing pressure in most of its range is minimal or negligible, and that the most recent available stock trends suggest that abundance is stable or increasing in the majority of its range, the North Pacific Spiny Dogfish is categorized as Least Concern. However, we caution that the status of this species should be monitored closely because: (i) population trends of some stocks (Northwest Pacific) are uncertain, (ii) it has a very long generation length (51 years), and (iii) there is international demand for fins.","The North Pacific Spiny Dogfish inhabits a wide depth range, from shallow waters down to 1,236 m (Ebert 2003). This species prefers water temperatures of 7–15˚C, and this preference drives both latitudinal and depth migrations (Ebert 2003). Some individuals and/or stocks of the North Pacific Spiny Dogfish may be highly migratory (Ketchen 1986, McFarlane and King 2003, Nakano <em>et al</em>. 2009).<br/><br/>The maximum size is 130 cm total length (TL) and 107 cm TL for females and males, respectively (Ebert 2003). Males mature at 70–80 cm TL, and females mature at 80–100 cm TL (Ebert 2003). Age at 50% maturity is 36 years for females, and 21 years for males, and this species may live longer than 80 years (Saunders and McFarlane 1993, Vega <em>et al</em>. 2009, Tribuzio and Kruse 2012). Reproduction is lecithotrophic viviparity, with an 18–24 month gestation period (Ketchen 1972, Tribuzio and Kruse 2012). Jones and Geen (1977) found that females reproduce every second year, and Tribuzio and Kruse (2012) found that a resting period between pregnancies of greater than or equal to one year might occur. Litter size ranges from 1–23 pups per breeding event, with an average of 8–12 depending on region (8.5 off Alaska) (Ketchen 1972, Tribuzio <em>et al</em>. 2009, Tribuzio and Kruse 2012). Average size at birth is 25–27 cm TL (Ketchen 1972).<br/><br/>The North Pacific Spiny Dogfish exhibits late maturity, slow intrinsic rebound potential (estimated unfished r = 0.02–0.03 yr-1; Tribuzio and Kruse 2011), low reproductive capacity (~9 pups every 2+ years; Tribuzio and Kruse 2012), high longevity (80 or more years; Saunders and McFarlane 1993, Vega <em>et al</em>. 2009) and long generation time of 51 years (COSEWIC 2011). Furthermore, the size and sexual segregation of this species results in mature females (usually pregnant due to the long gestation period) being more vulnerable and influenced by fishing pressure than the other age classes (Fordham <em>et al</em>. 2006a).","The North Pacific Spiny Dogfish, despite being naturally abundant, are susceptible to overfishing due to its life history characters (see <em>Habitat and Ecology</em> section). The life history parameters of this species lend itself to be more sensitive to fishing mortality than the closely-related species, Spiny Dogfish (S. acanthias), which is assessed to be globally Vulnerable. The market for the North Pacific Spiny Dogfish is expected to increase due to the decline of more traditional groundfish stocks (Fordham 2009), closure of European Union Spiny Dogfish fisheries, and the continuing international demand for shark fins, especially from certified fisheries. The discards and non-target catch data are likely severely underestimated as well (Beamish <em>et al</em>. 2009). Despite all of these pressures, the trend data and stock statuses indicate that this species is not currently under any major threat and none are expected in the near future.<br/><br/>The North Pacific Spiny Dogfish has historically been landed both commercially and recreationally in most parts of its range. Catches and landings for each stock are listed separately below. For the North Pacific Spiny Dogfish in Canadian and U.S. waters, many landings and fishery information are lumped together in most of the literature. The following paragraph is for all North Pacific Spiny Dogfish in Canadian and U.S. waters, and then below, if there is known information for a specific stock, it is described.<br/><br/>There are four major eras of the commercial fishery for the North Pacific Spiny Dogfish off the west coast of North America, starting with the 1870–1916 time period (Ketchen 1986, Beamish <em>et al</em>. 2009). During this fishery, North Pacific Spiny Dogfish were primarily exploited for reduction into oil for lubrication, lighting, and fertilizer (Ketchen 1986, Beamish <em>et al</em>. 2009). The highest volume of oil produced at this time was 1.2 million liters in 1883 (Ketchen 1986). The maximum average weight annually was almost 4,700 mt (Ketchen 1986, Beamish <em>et al</em>. 2009). The average annual catch of North Pacific Spiny Dogfish from this time period was 4,690 mt (Argue and Shepard 2005 in Beamish <em>et al</em>. 2009). The second era was from 1917–1939, and during this time North Pacific Spiny Dogfish were exploited for reduction into industrial oil and fish meal (Ketchen 1986, Beamish <em>et al</em>. 2009). The average annual catch during this time was 4,486 mt (Argue and Shepard 2005 in Beamish <em>et al</em>. 2009). The third era from 1937–1950 was known as the ‘Great Vitamin Liver fishery’ where North Pacific Spiny Dogfish were exploited for their livers as a source of vitamin A (Ketchen 1986, Beamish et al. 2009). The landings during this time peaked at 31,000 mt (Ketchen 1986, Beamish <em>et al</em>. 2009). After the discovery of synthetic vitamin A, the fishery collapsed (Ketchen 1986). During 1951–1974, the Canadian government subsidized the North Pacific Spiny Dogfish fishery. It is estimated that 6.7 million fish were taken during this time, all from the Strait of Georgia (Beamish <em>et al</em>. 2009). From 1980–2001, catches in the Strait of Georgia comprised 30% of the total catch of North Pacific Spiny Dogfish in British Columbia (Beamish <em>et al</em>. 2009). A fishery developed in Washington State in 1975 for human consumption, but the numbers fell through 1981 due to the decline of larger females (Ketchen 1986). In British Columbia, a fishery developed in 1977 for human consumption, with a peak in production in 1979 followed by sharp declines in the 1980s (Ketchen 1986).<br/><br/><em><strong>Northeast Pacific offshore stock</strong></em>:<br/>In the U.S., the offshore stock has been commercially fished since 1916 if not before, with two peaks: one in the 1940s (vitamin A liver fishery) and the other in the 1970s (food fishery) (Gertseva and Taylor 2011). During the vitamin A liver fishery, the landings peaked at 16,876 mt, with an average of 6,821 mt per year (Gertseva and Taylor 2011). In the past decade, the landings have remained lower, ranging from 164 to 876 mt (Gertseva and Taylor 2011). As of September 2011, the MSC certified the ‘British Columbia North Pacific Spiny Dogfish’ fishery as sustainable (MSC 2011). The MSC is an international non-profit organization that oversees third party objective fishery assessments (MSC 2016a). If the assessment finds that a specific fishery has healthy stocks, minimal ecosystem impacts, and an effective fisheries management system, they certify the fishery as sustainable and label the seafood as such (MSC 2016a). The MSC fishery for the North Pacific Spiny Dogfish uses bottom longlines and trawl gear for both the offshore stock and the stock in the Strait of Georgia (MSC 2016b). Around 3,000 mt of North Pacific Spiny Dogfish are taken annually and this catch is lower than the current ‘Total Allowable Catch’ (TAC) for British Columbia (9,250 mt; MSC 2011). In the U.S. today, most of the North Pacific Spiny Dogfish commercially landed are from Washington State (accounts for 90% of landings in U.S.) and for the last 10 years, landings have ranged between 164 and 876 mt (Gertseva and Taylor 2011). This species is commonly caught as bycatch today, with the majority discarded at sea (Gertseva and Taylor 2011). There are three fishing techniques that currently catch dogfish: trawl, hook and line, and a variety of nets (Gertseva and Taylor 2011). The recreational catch of this species does not account for a large proportion (1% verses 99% commercial) of total landings, but this statistic does not include any discards, which are believed to be considerable since the general statistic for discards is that 91% of encountered North Pacific Spiny Dogfish are discarded at sea (Bargmann and Zielinski 2009).<br/><br/><strong><em>The Puget Sound inshore stock</em></strong>:<br/>This stock has experienced two catch peaks in the past 80 years in terms of commercial fishing, and is currently at low levels (Palsson 2009). Before World War II, the catches were below 1,000 mt per year, and beginning in the 1940s, landings increased from less than a few hundred mt per year to over 4,000 mt per year (Palsson 2009). Following that peak, catches declined in the 1950s and 1960s to less than 1,000 mt per year, and almost to zero in the early 1970s (Palsson 2009). The mid-1970s marked the beginning of the second peak, with catches increasing to over 1,500 mt per year in the late 1970s through early 1980s, peaking at 4,000 mt per year in 1979 (Palsson 2009). In the following years (mid-1980s through mid-1990s), the harvest further declined to less than 1,000 mt per year and then to 300 mt per year starting in 1997 (Palsson 2009). These catch data do not include discards (Palsson 2009). Between 1982 and 2000, &gt;70% of the harvest was from the northern part of the Sound, although during the late 1970s and early 1980s, the harvest was more equal between the northern and southern Sound (Palsson 2009). The Washington [State] Department of Fish and Wildlife (WDFW) Puget Sound Survey indicated that North Pacific Spiny Dogfish abundance was at a low level, but the estimates from 2001 were higher than 1997 (Wallace <em>et al</em>. 2009).<br/><br/><strong><em>Strait of Georgia inshore stock</em></strong>:<br/>The commercial fishery for the North Pacific Spiny Dogfish in the Strait of Georgia dates back to the 1800s, with several peaks and troughs throughout its history. In the first era during 1870–1916, 65% of North Pacific Spiny Dogfish exploited were from the Strait of Georgia (Beamish <em>et al</em>. 2009). During the second era from 1917–1939, North Pacific Spiny Dogfish were almost exclusively taken from the Strait of Georgia, with an estimation of 143,038 mt (Ketchen 1986, Beamish <em>et al</em>. 2009). The annual average catch was 4,486 mt (Ketchen 1986, Beamish <em>et al</em>. 2009). During the government subsidized fishing era (1951–1974), 6.7 million fish, or 22,872 mt of North Pacific Spiny Dogfish were taken from the Strait of Georgia (Ketchen 1986, Beamish <em>et al</em>. 2009). Again, from 1980–2001, catches in the Strait of Georgia comprised 30% of the total catch of North Pacific Spiny Dogfish in British Columbia (Beamish et al. 2009). Since 2006, commercial fisheries for groundfish have 100% observer at-sea monitoring to account for bycatch (Mawani 2009). North Pacific Spiny Dogfish from this stock are also caught in the certified MSC fishery (see above).<br/><br/><strong><em>Alaskan stock</em></strong>: <br/>There is no directed fishery in Alaska (Tribuzio <em>et al</em>. 2010, 2011), although this species makes up a large proportion of bycatch in many economically valuable fisheries, namely longline fisheries for sablefish (<em>Anoplopoma fimbria</em>), Pacific Cod (<em>Gadus macrocephalus</em>), and Pacific Halibut (<em>Hippoglossus stenolepis</em>) (Conrath and Foy 2009, Tribuzio <em>et al</em>. 2010, Gasper and Kruse 2013). Information on the bycatch in Alaska is as follows, and is taken from the pre-STAR report for the Pacific Management Fishery Council meeting 11–15 July 2011 to asses the status of the North Pacific Spiny Dogfish, and is from various sources. North Pacific Spiny Dogfish are taken from the Gulf of Alaska in the Pacific Salmon gillnet fisheries, sablefish fisheries, Pacific Halibut longline fisheries, and groundfish trawl fisheries (Boldt 2003 in Gertseva and Taylor 2011). Tribuzio <em>et al</em>. (2011) estimated that an average of 530 tons per year of North Pacific Spiny Dogfish were taken from 1997–2007. Furthermore, the bycatch from State waters is not completely known (but estimates are documented in various reports, e.g. <a href=""https://pices.int/publications/pices_press/volume8_issue2/May00/Shark.pdf"">https://pices.int/publications/pices_press/volume8_issue2/May00/Shark.pdf</a>) and the bycatch from Federal waters are considered to be a conservative estimate due to the incomplete observing of fisheries (Gertseva and Taylor 2011). The NMFS and International Pacific Halibut Commission (IPHC) Gulf of Alaska surveys that collectively cover 1984–2003 indicate that there is a stable trend with increasing catch rates in 2003, and overall both indicate that North Pacific Spiny Dogfish in Gulf of Alaska are stable or even increasing (Wallace <em>et al</em>. 2009, Conrath and Foy 2009, Andrews and Foy 2009).<br/><br/><em><strong>Stock in Japanese waters</strong></em>:<br/>In Japan, this species has historically been landed and used. Beginning in 1990, a fishery developed for the bycatch of North Pacific Spiny Dogfish from bottom longline fishing vessels targeting Pacific cod (<em>Gadus macrocephalus</em>) or Pacific halibut (<em>Hippoglossus stenolepis</em>) in Hokkaido, and Aomori, Akita, and Ishikawa prefectures (northern part of Honshu, and central area of the Japan Sea coast, respectively). The fishery intensity reflected the oscillating price of fishmeal fertilizer (Nakano <em>et al</em>. 2009). In Hokkaido, a bottom gillnet fishery (with the exception of one prefecture using longline) developed during the same time (Nakano <em>et al</em>. 2009). During WWII, the bottom longline fishery expanded off Hokkaido and then into the sea of Okhotsk after WWII resulting from the increased demand from increased numbers of fish meal and liver oil factories (Nakano <em>et al</em>. 2009). Industrial bottom trawling for North Pacific Spiny Dogfish began, but soon shifted to bottom longlining (Nakano <em>et al</em>. 2009). The ‘total shark landing of Japan' was 50,000 mt in 1947 but it soon increased to 120,000 mt in 1950 (Taniuchi 1990 in Nakano <em>et al</em>. 2009). From 1951–1955, the average North Pacific Spiny Dogfish catch was over 44,000 mt (Nakano et al. 2009). From 1956–1959 the catch was about 30,000 mt per year, and from 1959–1967, the catch decreased steadily to less than 10,000 mt per year (Nakano <em>et al</em>. 2009). Unfortunately, in 1968, landing statistics for North Pacific Spiny Dogfish, Salmon Shark (<em>Lamna ditropis</em>), Blue Shark (<em>Prionace glauca</em>), and ‘other’ shark were combined into one category (Nakano <em>et al</em>. 2009). Since the 1950s, catches have greatly declined, and Nakano <em>et al</em>. (2009) stated that it was probably due to a reduction in stocks, decreased demand, and low prices (Nakano <em>et al</em>. 2009).<br/><br/>Most recently, North Pacific Spiny Dogfish are caught in the offshore bottom trawl fishery, with catches ranging from 1,000 mt (1970s) to less than 500 mt in recent years (Nakano et al. 2009). North Pacific Spiny Dogfish continues to be caught incidentally in local and offshore industrial fisheries (Nakano et al. 2009). Since North Pacific Spiny Dogfish are currently caught in the Aomori prefecture with bottom longlines, the larger females are more vulnerable due to their schooling and demersal nature (Nakano <em>et al</em>. 2009). Currently, the majority of North Pacific Spiny Dogfish is caught by the offshore bottom trawl fishery (Kitagawa 2005 in Nakano <em>et al</em>. 2009) and bottom longline fishery (Nakano <em>et al</em>. 2009), which selectively fishes for the mature members of the population, frequently mature pregnant females. Catch rates in Danish seines and bull trawls fell 90% from 100–200 kg per haul in the mid 1970s to 10–20 kg per haul in the late 1990s (Fisheries Agency of Japan 2003 in Nakano <em>et al</em>. 2009). Despite the decline in fishing effort in the inshore waters, (specifically the number of tows by the Japanese Danish seine fishery) since 2003, the CPUE (kg/tow) has increased in the same time period (Nakano et al. 2009). In addition, the fishery effort had increased from the early 1970s through 1990, and decreased since (Nakano <em>et al</em>. 2009). Nakano <em>et al</em>. (2009) concluded that the Japanese population of North Pacific Spiny Dogfish decreased historically and stayed low. In addition, Nakano <em>et al</em>. (2009) reported that an assessment report by Kitagawa (2005), that stated that the life history parameters of North Pacific Spiny Dogfish prevented it from restoring to pre-fished levels, and that fishing effort should not be increased.<br/><br/><em><strong>Stock in Russian waters</strong></em>: <br/>In Russian waters, a directed fishery for North Pacific Spiny Dogfish occurred pre-WWII, in which several mt were exploited annually (multiple authors in Orlov and Tokranov 2009). Currently, there is no directed fishery for North Pacific Spiny Dogfish, but they are incidentally caught in the Pacific salmon (<em>Oncorhynchus</em> spp.) fisheries (Grigorov and Orlov 2013). North Pacific Spiny Dogfish are commonly caught near the bottom off the coast of Eastern Russia (around the Sea of Okhotsk), Kuril Islands, Aleutian Islands, and eastern Bering Sea (Orlov <em>et al</em>. 2011).","The North Pacific Spiny Dogfish was previously assessed to be Vulnerable as subpopulations of the Spiny Dogfish (<em>S. acanthias</em>) in the Northeast Pacific and as Endangered in the Northwest Pacific. However, in the majority of the range of the North Pacific Spiny Dogfish, the population appears to be either stable or increasing. To that end, we have listed the current population trend for the North Pacific Spiny Dogfish as stable. This species has had a long history of exploitation and decline, but over the past decade, only small-scale targeted fisheries have existed, and the literature confirms that the majority of the population was found to be stable, if not increasing.<br/><br/>No genetic differences exist among North Pacific Spiny Dogfish in different regions of the Pacific Ocean Basin (Ebert <em>et al</em>. 2010). ‘Stocks’ as used here are not genetically distinct groups but divided based upon movement and exchange of individuals. It is thought that there are at least three stocks off the coast of North America: one offshore stock from Alaska to Baja California, and one each in both the Puget Sound and Strait of Georgia (Saunders <em>et al</em>. 1984, Ketchen 1986, McFarlane and King 2003, Beamish <em>et al</em>. 2009, Brodeur <em>et al</em>. 2009, Taylor <em>et al</em>. 2009, Wallace <em>et al</em>. 2009). Further work is needed to clarify the degree of connectivity of North Pacific Spiny Dogfish off Alaska to those in Puget Sound, Strait of Georgia, and the to the offshore stock (Conrath and Foy 2009, Gasper and Kruse 2013). Of the North Pacific Spiny Dogfish in Canadian waters, Saunders (1989) estimated that one-half to two-thirds constitutes the offshore stock, with the remaining in the inshore stock (Strait of Georgia). No estimate was found for the proportion of North Pacific Spiny Dogfish in the U.S. portion of the offshore stock verses the stock in south Puget Sound, the U.S. portion of the sound. The highest known densities in North America occur off British Columbia and Washington State, with density declining southward (Ebert <em>et al</em>. 2010). It is thought that the stocks in the Sea of Japan and off the coast of Japan (Pacific Ocean) are separate (Nakano <em>et al</em>. 2009). While transoceanic migrations from the U.S. West Coast to the Pacific Coast of Japan have been documented, the degree of connectivity between the two is not completely known (Ketchen 1986, McFarlane and King 2003).<br/><br/>Population trends for each stock are discussed below.<br/><br/><strong><em>Northeast Pacific offshore stock</em></strong>:<br/>In U.S. Pacific coastal waters, the North Pacific Spiny Dogfish was estimated to be at 53% of the unexploited level, which does not meet the requirements to be considered overfished (Gertseva and Taylor 2011). In addition, the historical abundance of the North Pacific Spiny Dogfish has always been above the management target (defined as 40% of the unfished spawning output), and in the past 10 years, a 1% relative exploitation rate (see Gertseva and Taylor 2011). In the Spiny Dogfish Assessment and Catch Recommendations for 2010, the British Columbian portion of the offshore stock is listed in the ’healthy zone’ with a maximum sustainable yield biomass (BMSY) of over 80% (Gallucci <em>et al</em>. 2011). This assessment also reported a biomass estimate of 210,063–318,841 mt, or 63–96% of the initial biomass (Gallucci <em>et al</em>. 2011). The long-term trend from the Hecate Strait survey shows that the stock appears to be stable (Wallace et al. 2009). In addition, data from the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) West Coast triennial survey have not indicated that there has been a change in abundance (Wallace <em>et al</em>. 2009).<br/><br/><em><strong>Puget Sound inshore stock</strong></em>:<br/>For geographical clarification, here, Puget Sound proper is considered to be South Puget Sound, with the northern region belonging to the Strait of Georgia (McFarlane and King 2009). The population of the North Pacific Spiny Dogfish in Puget Sound was judged to have declined based on groundfish stock assessments from the region (Palsson 2009; PSAT 1998, 2000, 2002), with data from both fishery-dependent and -independent ‘assessment techniques’ (see Palsson 2009). Coincidental declines in the commercial catch and catch per unit effort (CPUE) since 1997 were found (Palsson 2009), and the biomass indicators from bottom-trawl surveys show a marked decline from the mid-1990s and forward, corresponding to declines in total harvest and CPUE for set-nets (Palsson 2009). In addition, there was a 64% decline in biomass found from surveys in 1987–1991 and surveys conducted thereafter (Palsson 2009).<br/><br/><strong><em>Strait of Georgia inshore stock</em></strong>:<br/>There have been contrasting stock statuses found for the North Pacific Spiny Dogfish in the U.S. and Canadian portions of the Strait of Georgia. In the U.S. portion, an 82% decline in biomass over the past three decades has been found (see Palsson 2009). This is in direct contrast to the status of the North Pacific Spiny Dogfish in the Canadian proportion, which, based upon fishery performance and survey abundance, have remained stable or are actually increasing from the mid-1980s to 2005 (King and McFarlane 2009, Wallace et al. 2009). King and McFarlane (2009) examined the trends in North Pacific Spiny Dogfish abundance in the Strait of Georgia from 1980–2005, and concluded that the relative abundance of the North Pacific Spiny Dogfish has remained stable over the past 20 years. Wallace <em>et al</em>. (2009) looked at the CPUE from the southwest region of Vancouver Island and Hecate Strait, and concluded that the outside stock is stable and fishing pressure is low relative to the size of the estimated population. In the Spiny Dogfish Assessment and Catch Recommendations for 2010, biomass estimated from two different models categorize this stock in the ‘cautious zone’ as the biomass at maximum sustainable yield (BMSY) is between 40–80% (Gallucci <em>et al</em>. 2011). Palsson (2009) notes that North Pacific Spiny Dogfish abundance in the northern portion of Puget Sound was higher in 2004–2005 than previous years, which he suggests may be due to recovery or immigrants from the Canadian population. Due to the conflicting views of population trend data in the U.S. and Canadian portions of the Strait of Georgia, more work is needed to clarify the abundance trend.<br/><br/>A recent Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC) report summarized the available survey indices and found that most are moderate or poor in quality with respect to estimating North Pacific Spiny Dogfish trends mainly because they span less than one generation (51 years) (COSEWIC 2011). Consequently the indices are highly variable and uncertain. It was recognized that the mean size of individuals captured has declined over time since the earliest available data were from 1970–1990s (COSEWIC 2011).<br/><br/><em><strong>Alaskan Stock</strong></em>:<br/>Conrath and Foy (2009) examined CPUE from the Gulf of Alaska, Bering Sea, and Aleutian Islands, incidental catch, and abundance from surveys conducted by the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) Alaska Fisheries Science Center (CPUE data collected years 1984–2007), the International Pacific Halibut Commission (IPHC) (CPUE collected years 1997–2006), and NMFS’s North Pacific Groundfish Observer Program (CPUE for years 1979–1994 for Japanese-U.S. cooperative longline survey; 1988–2007 for U.S. only longline survey; incidental catch years 1990–2007; abundance in Gulf of Alaska 1984–2007) to determine the abundance, distribution, and status of the North Pacific Spiny Dogfish in Alaska. Based upon CPUE abundance indices and incidental catch rates, they found that decadal trends in abundance showed an increase in the central and eastern Gulf of Alaska in recent years (see Conrath and Foy 2009, Andrews and Foy 2009).<br/><br/>In summary, North Pacific Spiny Dogfish in Canadian Pacific waters are considered to be stable, as three separate surveys have indicated no long-term upward or downward trend (Wallace <em>et al</em>. 2009). In the U.S., North Pacific Spiny Dogfish abundance appears stable or increasing off of Alaska, stable for the offshore stock, and at a low level in Puget Sound (but with little fishing pressure) (Wallace <em>et al</em>. 2009).<br/><br/><em><strong>Stock in Japanese waters</strong></em>:<br/>Trends for this area are scarce, and Nakano <em>et al</em>. (2009), after reviewing the fisheries, utilisation, and stock status of the North Pacific Spiny Dogfish, stated that assessing the trend for this area would be difficult based upon the data at hand (Nakano <em>et al</em>. 2009). These researchers did project that the population of the North Pacific Spiny Dogfish in this area had declined historically and remained low (Nakano <em>et al</em>. 2009). Yet, fishermen are attempting to avoid them as bycatch and directed fishing effort is decreasing (Nakano <em>et al</em>. 2009).<br/><br/><em><strong>Stock in Russian waters</strong></em>:<br/>The status of the North Pacific Spiny Dogfish in the Northwest Pacific is largely unknown, but the range over the past decade may have expanded due to temperature fluctuations and climate change (Orlov <em>et al</em>. 2011).<br/><p></p>",Stable,"The North Pacific Spiny Dogfish is endemic to the North Pacific, from the West Coast of North America to the coasts of Japan and the Korean Peninsula. The range of this species extends northward to Russia and Alaska, eastward to the Gulf of Alaska, British Columbia, and Washington, and south to Baja California, Mexico (Ebert <em>et al</em>. 2010).","The North Pacific Spiny Dogfish has a long history of use and trade dating as far back as 2650 B.C. The majority of North Pacific Spiny Dogfish landed in North American Pacific waters have historically been used as a source of vitamin A, liver oil, a food source for human consumption, and fish meal (Ketchen 1986, Bargmann 2009, Beamish <em>et al</em>. 2009). Historical landings from Japan were mostly used for liver oil, fishmeal, human consumption, fish jelly, egg product, and shark fins (Nakano <em>et al</em>. 2009). Use and trade for other regions in this species’ range is unknown at this time.<br/><br/>In the active Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) certified fishery in British Columbia, North Pacific Spiny Dogfish are mostly exported to European and Asian countries as backs (backbones in), belly flaps, fins, tails, organic liquid fertilizer, and dried cartilage (MSC 2011).<br/><br/>In the 2010 proposal to include the Spiny Dogfish (<em>Squalus acanthias</em>) on Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES), it is stated that the Northeast Pacific (Alaska to California) stock is not of concern in terms of regulating trade (CITES 2010).",Marine,"<p>                  </p><p>Management exists in a very small area of this species’ range (Fordham <em>et al. </em>2006a, 2006b), and it is still taken as non-target catch in many fisheries or discarded at sea (Conrath and Foy 2009). Regulations are in place for British Columbia; North Pacific Spiny Dogfish are included in the integrated fisheries management plan under ‘other species’ with a total allowable catch (TAC) (the TAC has not been restrictive as the catch is lower than the allotment), allocation information, time, area, and gear restrictions, and enforcement requirements for each fishery for the fishing season (Mawani 2009). For the MSC certified fishery, the TAC for British Columbia is 14,000 mt with 9,520 mt accessible to the longline sector and 4,480 mt accessible by the trawl sector (MSC 2011). This fishery has 100% monitoring on-board and at landing sites to record all fishing activities. In Puget Sound, both the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife (WDFW) and the treaty tribes of Puget Sound manage North Pacific Spiny Dogfish (Palsson <em>et al.</em> 1998, Palsson 2009). The Pacific Fishery Management Council federally regulates this species off of the Pacific Coast of the United States, having included it into the ‘other fish’ category in the groundfish management plan, but catches are not limited (PFMC 2008, Bargmann 2009). In Japan, there are no regulations in place for this species, and in a 2005 assessment, there were recommendations to not increase fishing pressure (Nakano <em>et al.</em> 2009). Regulations for Russian and the Koreas were not found during this assessment. </p>","",,false,false,Global

Movement studies and DNA analyses have demonstrated that the White Shark undertakes long distance trans-oceanic movements, for example between South Africa and Australasia (Pardini <em>et al. </em>2001, Bonfil <em>et al.</em> 2005), and California and the Hawaiian Islands (Boustany <em>et al.</em> 2002, Domeier and Nasby-Lucas 2008, Jorgensen <em>et al</em>. 2010). Consequently, its distribution is not considered disjunct, rather that interchange between some areas may be limited. <br/><br/>The maximum size is undetermined, but estimated at 600–640 cm total length (TL) (Compagno 2001). Males mature at 310–410 cm TL (Pratt 1996, Compagno 2001, Tanaka <em>et al.</em> 2011); the majority of females mature at 400–500 cm TL (Francis 1996, Tanaka <em>et al.</em> 2011) but have been reported as immature at 472–490 cm TL (Springer 1939, Compagno 2001); and, size at birth is  120–150 cm TL (Francis 1996). Reproduction is aplacental viviparous with oophagy and histrophy, with litter sizes of 2–17 and  a suspected two to three year reproductive cycle (Francis 1996, Uchida <em>et al. </em>1996,<strong> </strong>Mollet and Cailliet 2002, Bruce 2008, Domeier 2012, Sato <em>et al</em>. 2016). In the Northwest Atlantic, Northeast Pacific, and Western Indian Oceans, female age-at-maturity of 30–33 years and maximum age of&#160; 30–73 years were reported based on bomb radiocarbon validated ages (Hamady&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014, Andrews and Kerr 2015, Natanson and Skomal 2015,&#160;Christiansen<em> et al. </em>2016). Due to the accurate method of bomb radiocarbon ageing, these are possibly more accurate than the previous lower estimates of female age-at-maturity of 7–15 years and maximum ages of 18–30 years (Cailliet <em>et al.</em> 1985, Wintner and Cliff 1999, Bruce 2008, Tanaka<em> et al.</em> 2011, Hillary <em>et al.</em> 2018). Using the precautionary approach and the validated, most conservative bomb radiocarbon ages of age-at-maturity of 33 years and maximum age of 73 years, generation length is 53 years.<strong></strong><strong> </strong>The bomb radiocarbon maximum age is accepted as being likely  &gt;30 years, minimum of 44 years, and possibly maximum of 73 years. The  female age-at-maturity is possibly more contentious and to explore the sensitivity of the global population trend analyses to the younger female age-at-maturity, estimates of female age-at-maturity of 15 years and maximum age of 44 years were also used, that led to a generation length of 29.5 years (see Population section).","<p>The White Shark is caught as bycatch mostly in inshore fisheries in a range of gears, such as longlines, setlines, gillnets, trawls, hand-held rod and reel, and fish-traps; it is rarely caught in offshore pelagic fisheries (Bruce 2008, Lowe <em>et al.</em> 2012, Dewar&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2013, Lyons <em>et al</em>. 2013, Francis 2017, Onate-Gonzalez <em>et al. </em>2017). The species has a relatively high post-release survival in net fisheries (Lyons <em>et al.</em> 2013, Benson <em>et al. </em>2018). The White Shark is targeted in beach protection programs in Australia and South Africa that use drum-lines and gillnets; however, in some instances these programs release live sharks (Dudley and Simpfendorfer 2006, Bruce 2008, Reid <em>et al.</em> 2011, Braccini&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017, Kock <em>et al.</em> 2018, Lee<em> et al. </em>2018, Roff <em>et al.</em> 2018). A shark control program in Réunion Island targets Tiger Sharks (<em>Galeocerdo cuvier</em>) and Bull Sharks (<em>Carcharhinus leucas</em>), with no captures of White Sharks reported to date (Florida Museum 2019).</p>","<p>There are no data available on the absolute global population size of the White Shark. Genetic data suggest one global population; however, there is some genetic structuring between ocean basins, potentially within ocean basins, and likely global male-biased dispersal and female philopatry (Pardini <em>et al</em>. 2001, Jorgensen <em>et al.</em> 2010, Gubili <em>et al</em>. 2012, O'Leary <em>et al</em>. 2015, Andreotti<em> et al. </em>2016, Bernand <em>et al</em>. 2018). White Shark total abundances have been estimated for a number of regions: 5,460 in eastern Australasia in 2017 (uncertainty range: 2,909–12,802) (Bruce <em>et al.</em> 2018, Hillary <em>et al. </em>2018); in excess of 2,000 in the Northeast Pacific in 2012 (Dewar <em>et al.</em> 2013, Burgess <em>et al</em>. 2014); and, in South Africa: 1,279 in KwaZulu-Natal in 1996 (Cliff <em>et al.</em> 1996), 908 in Gansbaai from 2007–2011 (95% CI: 808–1,008) (Towner <em>et al</em>. 2013), 723 in False Bay from 2004–2012 (95% CI: 466–980) (Hewitt 2014), 389 from 2008–2010 in Mossel Bay (95% CI: 351–428) (Ryklief 2012), and 438 for all of South Africa in 2011 (Andreotti <em>et al</em>. 2016), although there are concerns for the validity of this last estimate (Irion <em>et al.</em> 2017).<br/></p>  <p><span lang=""EN-US"">Population trend data are available from four sources: (1) standardized relative abundance in the Northwest Atlantic (Curtis <em>et al.</em> 2014); and standardized catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) in: (2) the Northeast Pacific (Dewar<em> et al.</em> 2013); (3) the South Pacific (Reid <em>et al</em>. 2011); and, (4) the Indian Ocean (Dudley and Simpfendorfer 2006) updated with data to 2012 (S. Wintner pers. comm. 3/10/2018). The trend data from each source were analysed over three generation lengths using a Bayesian state-space framework (a modification of Winker <em>et al</em>. 2018). This analysis yields an annual rate of change, a median change over three generation lengths, and the probability of the most likely IUCN Red List Category percent change over three generations (see the Supplementary Information).</p><span lang=""EN-US"">    <p>First, the Curtis <em>et al.</em>&#160;(2014) relative abundance was used to represent data on catches in the Northwest Atlantic as it is the longest and most comprehensive compilation of data available for the region. It includes fishery-independent longline surveys, observer data from the shark-target bottom longline fishery, and recreational fishing tournament data. The relative abundance trend indicates historically higher abundances in the 1960s followed by a declining trend until the mid-1980s, and then an increasing trend since the 1990s, when a range of management measures were implemented (Curtis <em>et al.</em> 2014). The three generation trend analysis of the Northwest Atlantic CPUE for 1961–2010 (50 years) revealed annual rates of reduction of 1.0%, consistent with an estimated median reduction of 80.8% over three generation lengths (159 years), with the highest probability of &gt;80% reduction over three generation lengths. This probability of a high level of reduction is over a very long period of three generations; it has incorporated the reductions from historically higher abundances and projected an estimated trend based on those reductions for a considerable period beyond that of the time-series and is thus indicative of historic declines rather than the recent increasing trend since 1990.<br/></p><p>Second, in the Northeast Pacific, White Sharks have mainly been taken in inshore net fisheries. Fisheries catch data were available from the California set net fishery which accounts for the majority of White Shark bycatch in that area; this indicated declines during the 1980s followed by a gradual increase from 1990s onwards (Dewar <em>et al.</em> 2013). Based on those data, information from photo-identification studies, and other researchers, the status review of White Shark in the Northeast Pacific concluded that the White Shark abundance was stable or increasing although there was some uncertainty around this conclusion due to the limited long-term abundance data for the region (Dewar <em>et al.</em> 2013). The trend analysis of the Northeast Pacific California set net fishery CPUE for 1980–2010 (31 years) revealed annual rates of increase of 4.1%, consistent with an estimated median increase of 602.1% over three generation lengths (159 years), with the highest probability of increases over three generation lengths.<br/></p><p>Third, one of the longest datasets in the South Pacific is from the east coast of Australia shark meshing program in New South Wales (1950–2009) in which White Shark standardized CPUE markedly declined from 1950 to the 1990s after which it began to slowly increase (Reid <em>et al. 2</em>011). During this period there were modifications to net specifications and spatial and temporal effort, and since 2010, further changes have been implemented that include a reduction in net soak time (Reid <em>et al</em>. 2011, NSW DPI 2018). From 2008 to 2018, catches of White Sharks in the meshing program have fluctuated between 3 and 26 individuals annually, with increasing catches in the latter years (NSW DPI 2018). Further north along Australia's east coast, the standardized CPUE of White Sharks also declined significantly, by 92% over 54 years (1962–2015) in the Queensland Shark Control Program (Roff <em>et al.</em> 2018). The trend analysis of the NSW shark meshing program CPUE for 1950–2009 (60 years) revealed annual rates of reduction of 1.8%, consistent with an estimated  median reduction of 95.8% over three generation lengths (159 years),  with the highest probability of &gt;80% reduction over three generation lengths. Since mid-1990s protection of White Sharks in Australia, adult White Sharks abundance has been estimated to have slightly declined or remained stable with population growth rates unlikely to be greater than 3% per year (Bruce<em> et al.</em> 2018, Hillary <em>et al.</em> 2018). Based on the current <span lang=""EN-US"">eastern Australasian abundance estimate and species demographics (assuming continued protection) there should potentially be an increase in the eastern Australasian abundance as the current juvenile cohorts enter into maturity (R. Bradford pers. comm. 07/02/2019).<br/></span></p><p>Fourth, long-term standardized CPUE in shark nets off KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa beaches in the Western Indian Ocean fluctuated considerably but was stable over time (Dudley and Simpfendorfer 2006). The trend analysis of the shark net CPUE for 1978–2012 (35 years) revealed annual rates of increase of 0.1%, consistent with an estimated  median increase of 13.1% over three generation lengths (159 years),  with the highest probability of increases over three generation lengths. In the West Australian Indian Ocean, the White Shark modeled abundance is not predicted to have increased by more than 10% since 1997 when protection was enacted (Braccini <em>et al.</em> 2017).<br/></p><span lang=""EN-US""><p>Further to the above data and analyses, in the Mediterranean Sea, based on anecdotal records and limited fisheries data, the White Shark is suspected to have declined by at least 80% over 69 years from 1947–2016 (Soldo <em>et al.</em> 2016). With the exception of the Mediterranean Sea, in all other regions with data, the status review and studies indicate that the White Shark has declined  during the 1980s and has begun to show signs of increasing since  protection has been implemented. </p><p>Across the regions, the White Shark is estimated to be declining from historic levels in the Northwest Atlantic and South Pacific, and increasing in the Northeast Pacific and Indian Ocean. The trends among ocean regions are highly variable and while they are mostly based on long datasets, they are extrapolated over a very long three generation length of 159 years which increases the uncertainty in the estimated regional trends. With the exception of the Northwest Atlantic, they are also based on datasets from limited areas within each region and may not accurately represent the trend in White Shark across the entire region. Despite these caveats, the trend data are the best available and were used for the estimation of a global population trend; the estimated three generation population trend for each region was weighted according to the relative size of each region.&#160;<span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US"">The overall  estimated median reduction was 53.8%,  with the highest probability of a &lt;20% reduction over three  generation  lengths (159 years).

Discard rates are unknown, but fishing mortality is high; at-vessel-mortality estimates from gillnet fisheries range from 33<a name=""_Hlk25584564"">–</a>85% (Ellis <em>et al.</em> 2017).&#160;</p><p>Off southeast Australia, the species has been regularly reported from demersal trawl, longline, gillnet and dropline fisheries at depths of 200–600 m (Walker and Gason 2007). In the Australian Southern and Eastern Scalefish and Shark Fishery (SESSF), total shark catches from the eastern and western deep-water shark fisheries peaked in 1998 at 330 t and 400 t, respectively, before declining to &lt;25 t in each zone by 2007 (Patterson&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2018).&#160;A semi-quantitative risk assessment for chondrichthyan bycatch species taken in the SESSF ranked this species with low risk from current commercial&#160;fishing as fishing effort has been reduced and the species likely has some refuge at depth&#160;(T.

For example, 97 individuals were reported from a single overnight gillnet fishing operation in Samborombón Bay, Argentina (De Wysiecki <em>et al</em>. 2018). Discrete populations with little evidence of migration increases the risk of localized population reduction. The Broadnose Sevengill Shark may also be susceptible to coastal development and environmental changes given its reliance on inshore habitat (Milessi&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2019).</p>","Population genetics indicate high genetic variability&#160;of the Broadnose&#160;Sevengill Shark&#160;among oceanic regions (Eastern Pacific, South Atlantic, and Southwest Pacific), suggesting three genetically distinct populations with little to no mixing&#160;populations which requires further investigation<span class=""MsoCommentReference"">&#160;(Schmidt-Roach 2019). The species is infrequently reported across much of its range. It has a high distribution overlap with intensive fishing activities throughout most of its known range, including past and/or present targeted shark fisheries across South America&#160;(Gonzalez-Pestana <em>et al.</em> 2016, Irogyen and Trobbiani 2016), southern Africa (da Silva<em> et al.</em> 2015), Taiwan (Ebert <em>et al.</em> 2013b), and Australia (Graham<em>&#160;et al.&#160;</em>2001,&#160;Walker and Gason 2007).<br/><br/>In the Southwest Pacific, species-specific population trend data are available from nominal catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) over 60 years between 1950<a name=""_Hlk25584564"">–</a>2009 off New South Wales, Australia (Reid <em>et al</em>. 2011).&#160;The trend data were analyzed over three generation lengths (65 years) using a Bayesian state-space framework (Winker <em>et al. </em>2020). This analysis yields an annual rate of change, a median change over three generation lengths, and the probability of the most likely IUCN Red List category percent change over three generations (see the Supplementary Information).&#160;The trend analysis revealed an annual rate of increase of 3.4% consistent with an estimated increase over three generation lengths (65 years), with the highest probability of&#160;no reductions in population over the three generation lengths.&#160;<br/><br/>There is some ancedotal evidence of population reduction in the south Atlantic.

In addition, the abundance of the species based on expert fishers knowledge dating back to the 1950s&#160;was estimated to have declined by up to 80% (Irogyen and Trobbiani 2016). Off southern Namibia, in 1990 a targeted fishery developed and closed within a year of operation due to the collapse of the stock (D. A. Ebert, pers. comm. 22/04/2020).&#160;&#160;<span class=""MsoCommentReference""><span class=""MsoCommentReference""><br/><span class=""MsoCommentReference""><span class=""MsoCommentReference""><br/>In the Northwest Pacific, in Taiwan, landings data on all combined shark species from coastal and offshore fisheries within the Taiwan Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) showed a 52% decline for all shark species combined over 63 years from 1953–2015 (H. Hsu, Taiwan National Fisheries Statistics pers. comm. 28/08/2019, Liao&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2019).&#160;The annual landings rose from ~8,300 t in the 1950s to a peak of 32,400 t in 1975, then declined steadily to 4,023 t in 2015 (H.

Industrial effort did decline after the 1990s, however, there remains considerable industrial and artisanal fishing effort. These long-term declines in abundance of sharks can be inferred to represent reductions in their populations, as the declines have occurred since the peak catches of the mid–1970s, prior to any noticeable reduction in the 1990s of industrial fisheries effort. Reconstructed catches of sharks, rays, and skates between 1950<a name=""_Hlk22720982"">–2014 for the</a><a name=""_Hlk20403173"">&#160;Japan and China EEZ</a>s, based on landings data, &#160;have shown declines of 98% (1,300 t to 14 t annually) and 67% (90,000 t to 30,000 t annually), respectively (Zeller and Pauly 2016). In Japan, some of the decline may be due to reduced fishing effort, but the level of decline is much greater than the decline in fishing effort which infers there has been an actual decline in the abundance of sharks, rays, and skates in the Japan EEZ. Across China, fishing effort has increased substantially since the 1950s and continues to increase, despite efforts by the Chinese government since the 1980s to restrict effort in response to depletion of inshore fisheries resources due to bottom trawling and stake nets (Pauly and Liang 2019). In South Korea, reconstructed catch data showed a 97% decline in landings of sharks, rays, and skates from 1969–2014 (Zeller and Pauly 2016). Catches were minimal&#160;during 1950, then rose steeply during the mid-1960s to a peak of 8,900 t, followed by a steady decline to 294 t in 2014&#160;(Zeller and Pauly 2016).&#160;Fishing effort in South Korea has increased by about one-quarter since the 1950s (Anticamara<em> et al.</em> 2011).<p>When these declines are scaled to three generation lengths (65 years) they represent declines of 99%, 67%, 99%, and 53% in Japan, China, South Korea, and Taiwan, respectively. These levels of declines are not species-specific but are informative for understanding the broader levels of decline in sharks in the region. Based on suspected declines in part of its range (south Atlantic, Northwest Pacific) and increasing trends in the Southwest Pacific, high levels of exploitation across most of the species' range, and a precautionary approach regarding the potential for separate subpopulations, a global population reduction of 30–49% was suspected over three generation lengths (65 years).

It has been recorded from the continental shelves and <span lang=""EN-GB"">upper slopes at depths of 50–1,500 m, and mostly 300–1,100 m. The Gulper Shark is caught as target and incidental catch in small scale and commercial fisheries using a variety of fishing gear. The species is retained for its liver oil, which is considered the most valuable of shark liver oil and is an important marine resource for local communities. Gulper sharks (<em>Centrophorus </em>spp) are known for their slow life histories and targeted fisheries for the species have collapsed over a relatively short time (&lt;20 years). Much of the species' distribution overlaps with intensive fishing activities, but the species may find some refuge at depth. The species is suspected to have undergone large population reduction and ongoing declines across the Indo-Pacific and West Africa.

Deep-water dogfishes, including a number of&#160;<em>Centrophorus&#160;</em>spp, are targeted and/or retained as bycatch throughout Indonesia for their high value liver oil (White&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2006, Blaber&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;2009, Gunawan 2013, Samusamu and Dharmadi 2017). Fisheries occur at depths of 200–800 m (Samusamu and Dharmadi, 2017), but have also been reported near shore at depths &lt;100 m (Gunawan 2013). There is a high level of fisheries resource use and increasing fishing pressure across Indonesia, and demersal coastal fisheries resources have been severely depleted in many areas across the Indo-West Pacific (Stobutzki&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;2006).&#160;Catches of sharks and rays in Southeast Asia are very high, but are declining and fishers are travelling much further from port in order to increase catches (Chen 1996). <br/><br/>Gulper sharks&#160;have been historically exploited commercially in the Northeast Atlantic. Most catch is thought to comprise Leafscale Gulper Shark (<em>Centrophorus squamosus</em>), however, catches of Gulper Shark are thought to have been misidentified with this species. Landings of the Leafscale Gulper Shark were historically aggregated with other deep-water dogfish (primarily the Portuguese Dogfish,&#160;<em>Centroscymnus coelolepis</em>)&#160;in a mixed landing category, referred to as “siki” shark (ICES-WGEF 2018). Despite a number of management measures to reduce deep-water shark fishing mortality, deep-water sharks are still captured in demersal fisheries (e.g. Fauconnet&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2019).&#160;Discard mortality is unknown, but presumed to be high (Rodríguez-Cabello and Sánchez 2017) and the extent of illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing is unknown (ICES-WGEF 2018).<br/><br/>Between 1950–1998, <a style="""">there was an apparent increase in reported landings</a><span class=""MsoCommentReference"">&#160;of deep-water sharks and dogfishes across the east central Atlantic region (e.g.&#160;Vasconcellos and Watson 2004). Deep-water sharks were first exploited in Senegal during World War II, and have been reported in landings from Cape Verde since the 1950s (Diop and Dossa 2011). More recent targeted longline fisheries for&#160;deep-water sharks have been identified in countries such as Mauritania and Ghana (FAO 2016). In Mauritania and Namibia, deep-water sharks have been reported as bycatch from black hake (<em>Merluccius senegalensis</em>&#160;and&#160;<em>M. polli</em>) fisheries (Fernández&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2005, Kainge<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2010) and unidentified deep-water sharks are also reported from regional and distant water shrimp trawlers (FarFish 2017). Accurate species-specific catches of deep-water sharks <a>are difficult to </a>determine and likely underestimated due to on-board processing as deep-water sharks are rarely landed whole (Fernández&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2005). Gulper Sharks are occasionally reported (&lt;1 t annually between 2010–12) in demersal trawl and hake longline fisheries off South Africa (da Silva&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2015).<br/><br/>In India, fisheries employing a number of gear types (trawl, longline, gill net, hook and line) have expanded further offshore into deeper waters as inshore stocks become heavily exploited. A targeted gulper shark (<em>Centrophorus&#160;</em>spp) liver oil fishery (operating at depths of &gt;300–1,000 m) commenced in 2002, and during the period 2002–2008, there was a major increase in landings of deep-water sharks (see Akhilesh&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2011, 2013, Akhilesh and Ganga 2013). Targeting fishing has occurred off the Andaman Islands&#160;since the 1980s (Soundararajan and Roy 2004). Reports of large quantities of shark liver oil recently transported out of Somalia may be indicative of developing fisheries in this region (K.K. Bineesh unpubl. data 2019). <br/><br/>Deep-water sharks have been targeted in demersal longline and gillnet fisheries operating in areas managed under the Southern Indian Ocean Fisheries Agreement (SIOFA); the latter of these fisheries ceased in 2015 (Georgeson<em>&#160;et al</em>.&#160;2019). Gillnet catches of the Gulper Shark peaked at 128 t in 2013 and declined to 30 t in 2015; an additional 102 t of the species was taken in the same year using longline gear (Georgeson<em>&#160;et al</em>.&#160;2019). An ecological risk assessment framework for deep-water sharks found the Gulper Shark to have high to extreme vulnerability across all fisheries in Southern Indian Ocean (Georgeson&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2019).&#160;</p>","<p>Taxonomic uncertainty and identification issues have led to some confusion over the occurrence of Gulper Sharks, often leading to this group reported under a generic category (e.g.&#160;<em>Centrophorus&#160;</em>spp). Species-specific population trend data are available from nominal catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) in the&#160;Gulf of Mexico (C. Cotton unpubl. data 2019). The trend data from each source were analysed over three generation lengths (83.4 years) using a Bayesian state-space framework (Winker&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2020). This analysis yields an annual rate of change, a median change over three generation lengths, and the probability of the most likely IUCN Red List category percent change over three generations (see the Supplementary Information). The trend analysis revealed an annual rate of decrease of 10.1%, with the highest probability of&#160;&gt;80% reductions in population over the three generation lengths (83.4 years). <br/><br/><a>Nearly&#160;</a>all landings of Gulper Sharks, other than the Leafscale Gulper Shark (<em>Centrophorus squamosus</em>), from the Northeast Atlantic have been reported from the Portuguese longline fishery (ICES-WGEF 2018). Annual landings were ~100 t until 2008, and rapidly declined to 2 t in 2009, likely in response to reduced abundance and restrictive management measures (ICES-WGEF 2018).<br/><br/>In the east Atlantic, reported fish landings <a style="""">from&#160;</a>distant water fleets increased from 600,000 t to 4.5 million t between 1950 and 2000 (Alder and Sumaila 2004). Between 1984–2001, landings of the most reported squalid sharks in the Mauritania hake fishery, including the Gulper Shark, declined steadily from 158 t to 37 t, with a minimum catch of 3.5 t reported in 1999 (Fernández<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2005), amounting to a reduction in squalid landings of &gt;99% over three generations. Causes of these declines have been attributed to changes in the fishing fleet, economics, and likely over-exploitation of both the target species and bycatch (Fernández<em>&#160;et al.&#160;</em>2005).&#160;Many regional fisheries are now characterised by severe over-exploitation and declines in abundance of marine resources (e.g. Gascuel&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2007). <br/><br/>Off the Maldives, the gulper shark stock collapsed in the early 2000s due to targeted fishing, after only about 20 years of exploitation. Although time-series data are not available for catches or landings, there is data for shark liver oil exports. These show a peak in 1982 soon after the fishery commenced followed by a general downwards trend until 1989, increases in 1990 and 1991, before a complete crash sometime thereafter as available data shows very low export figures for 1996 onward (Kyne and Simpfendorfer 2007, Ali 2015). The fishery has ceased and since 2010 there has been no shark fishing in the Maldives. <br/><br/>The gulper shark stock off India is suspected to have similarly collapsed as a result of the rapid development of deep-water fishing off western India. Gulper shark&#160;landings declined from 114 t in 2008 to 39 t in 2011 (K.K. Bineesh, unpubl. data 2019), equating to a population reduction of &gt;99% over three generations (~83 years). Off the southwest coast of the South Andaman Islands, the hooking rate of gulper sharks&#160;declined from 18% to 1–14% between 1984–2004 (Soundararajan and Roy 2004). In Sri Lanka, the targeted gulper shark fishery at Valaichchenai, which dates back to the 1980s, has seen a large reduction in effort, from 30 to 2 vessels, in recent years (A. Tanna pers. comm. 21/11/19). The rationale for this reduction in fleet is claimed to be self-regulation of the fishery, although lack of long-term economic and biological viability of the fishery is also suspected.<br/><br/>In Indonesia, data from a targeted bottom longline fishing for gulper sharks&#160;landed in the Tenau, East Nusa Tenggara, documented a decline in catch per unit effort (CPUE) from 145 kg/trip to 78 kg/trip between 2011–2014; the Gulper Shark was found to account for 15–20% of&#160;<em>Centrophorus&#160;</em>spp catch (Samusamu and Dharmadi 2017). Total catch of dogfishes, a mixed category for more than 10 species, reported to the Indonesian&#160;National Shark Data Collection program&#160;decreased from&#160;16,536 t in 2005 to 4,820 t in 2016&#160;(DGCF, 2017).

Commercial captures of the Gulper Shark in Japan is unknown. In Suruga Bay, Japan, research surveys using drop line and demersal longline reported 355&#160;<em>Centrophorus&#160;</em>spp across 125 hauls and 55 000 hooks, with the highest CPUE occurring in waters &gt;1,000 m (Yano and Kugai 1993). In 2003, a demersal trawl survey reported a CPUE of 1–6 individuals per tow caught between 500–1,000 m (Yamada <em>et al.</em> 2007). These surveys have used different methods and are thus not comparable, but could indicate the species is found at low density in the region, or is found at depths beyond most fishing effort.<br/><br/>The Gulper Shark is both estimated and suspected to be declining across much of its range.&#160;<a>Area</a>-weighted trend analysis for related species <em>Centrophorus squamosus</em> indicated a 46.7% median population reduction with the highest probability of 59% reduction (see assessment for <em>C. squamosus</em>).&#160;Overall, a population reduction of 50–79% was estimated over the last three generations (~83 years), based on abundance data and levels of exploitation.

It is more frequently found close to land and in temperate waters (Ebert <em>et al.</em> 2013). The species reaches a maximum size of 573 cm total length (TL), and possibly 635 cm TL; size at birth is 120–150 cm TL, males mature at 260–420 cm TL, and females mature at 260–465 cm TL (Ebert <em>et al. </em>2013, Young <em>et al.</em> 2016). Reproduction is aplacental viviparous oophagous with litter sizes of 2–6 pups and an annual or biennial reproductive cycle (Gubanov 1978, Cailliet and Bedford 1983, Ebert&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2013, Gervelis and Natanson 2013). The potential annual rate of population increase under sustainable fishing is higher than that of the Pelagic Thresher&#160;and Bigeye Thresher&#160;and has been estimated at 0.254 (Dulvy <em>et al.</em> 2008). Female age at maturity is estimated at 13 years and maximum age is 38 years based on bomb-radiocarbon validated ages from the Northwest Atlantic (Natanson <em>et al.</em>  2016). In the Eastern Central Pacific, age-at-maturity estimates are  much younger, though not validated with female age-at-maturity at 5.3  years and maximum age at 22 years off California  (Smith <em>et al</em>. 2008). It is possible these are regional  differences in life history parameters, but adopting a precautionary  approach, the validated bomb radiocarbon ages are used for both regions  to give a generation length of 25.5 years.</p>","The Common Thresher is caught globally as target and bycatch in commercial and small-scale pelagic&#160;longline, purse seine, and gillnet fisheries. Most catch is taken as bycatch of industrial pelagic fleets in offshore and high-seas waters (Camhi <em>et al.</em> 2008). It is also captured in coastal longlines, gillnets, trammel nets and sometimes trawls, particularly in areas with narrow continental shelves (Camhi <em>et al.</em> 2008, Martinez-Ortiz <em>et al.</em> 2015).<p>The species is generally retained for the meat and fins (Clarke <em>et al.</em> 2006a<em>, </em>Clarke<em> et al. </em>2006b, Dent and Clarke 2015<em>,</em> Fields <em>et al.</em> 2018), unless regulations prohibit retention<em>.</em> Under-reporting of catches in the pelagic and domestic fisheries is likely (Dent and Clarke 2015).<em> </em>The species is highly valued by big-game recreational fishers, and although many practice catch and release, recreational fishing could be a threat due to post-release mortality that has been estimated for the Common Thresher as 78% for tail-hooked and 0% for mouth-hooked animals (i.e. all mouth-hooked animals survived) (Camhi <em>et al.</em> 2008, Sepulveda <em>et al. </em>2015).<span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US""><span lang=""EN-US""> At vessel mortality of 66.7% was estimated on Portuguese longlines in the Atlantic (Coelho <em>et al. </em>2012).&#160;</span></span></p>","There are no data for population size of the Common Thresher. Genetic results indicate one global population, however there is some genetic structuring between the Northwest Atlantic and the Pacific Oceans (Trejo 2005).<br/><br/>Population trend data are available from two sources: (1) relative abundance data in the North Atlantic (Young <em>et al</em>. 2016); and, (2) nominal catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) in the Eastern North Pacific (Teo <em>et al</em>. 2016). The trend data from each source were analysed over three generation lengths using a Bayesian state-space framework (a modification of Winker <em>et al</em>. 2018). This analysis yields an annual rate of change, a median change over three generation lengths, and the probability of the most likely IUCN Red List Category percent change over three generations (see the Supplementary Information).<br/><br/>First, the relative abundance observer time-series from the United States pelagic longline fishery for 1992–2013 indicated that the abundance in the Northwest Atlantic had stabilized, while noting that fishing pressure had been present for more than two decades prior to 1992 and that the abundance had stabilized at lower abundance than unexploited biomass (Young <em>et al</em>. 2016). The trend analysis of the same time-series for 1992–2013 (22 years) revealed annual rates of reduction of 4.6%, consistent with an estimated median reduction of 97.0% over three generation lengths (76.5 years), with the highest probability of &gt;80% reduction over three generation lengths. Although reported to have stabilized, the 4.6% annual rate of reduction in the time-series produced a high reduction when extrapolated beyond the length of the data time-series to three generation lengths.<br/><br/>Second, the nominal logbook CPUE from California, United States west coast swordfish/shark drift gillnet fishery for 1981–2013 (33 years) was used as it considered the most important west coast commercial fishery for Common Thresher (Teo <em>et al</em>. 2016). The Common Thresher stock declined steeply in the early 1980s, then stabilized in the mid-1980s after regulations were implemented, and then increased through to ~2000 before stabilizing again, with the current stock considered close to unexploited level and unlikely to be overfished (Teo <em>et al</em>. 2016). The trend analysis of the CPUE for 1981–2013 (33 years) revealed annual rates of increase of 0.6%, consistent with an estimated median increase of 18.7% over three generation lengths (76.5 years), with the highest probability of an increase over three generation lengths.<br/><br/>Further to the above data and trend analyses, in the Southwest Atlantic CPUE of Common Thresher declined by 97% between 2002 and 2005 (Berrondo <em>et al</em>. 2006). Steep declines have occurred in the Mediterranean Sea; Ferretti <em>et al</em>. (2008) compiled nine time-series of abundance indices from commercial and recreational fishery landings, scientific surveys, and sighting records, to reconstruct long-term population trends of large sharks in the northwestern Mediterranean Sea. The Common Thresher showed an average instantaneous rate of decline in abundance of -0.11 (time range 108 years) and biomass of -0.10 (time range 108 years), which equates to an estimated decline of 99.9% in abundance and biomass since the early 19th century (Ferretti <em>et al</em>. 2008).<br/><br/>The Common Thresher is estimated to be declining in the North Atlantic and increasing in the Eastern North Pacific. However, the increasing trend in the Eastern North Pacific is from a managed fishery and may not be representative of trends in the wider Pacific. To estimate a global population trend, the estimated three generation population trends for each region were weighted according to the relative size of each region. The overall estimated median population reduction was 47.0%, with the highest probability of a &lt;20% reduction over three generation lengths (76.5 years). However, as the trends are uncertain and there is a lack of data from other regions of the world, expert judgement elicitation was used to estimate a global population reduction of 30–49% over the last three generations, based on abundance data and levels of exploitation.

Reproduction is viviparous and oophagous with an estimated gestation period of 15–18  months and a three-year reproductive cycle (Mollet and Cailliet 2002). Litter size is 4–25 pups (possibly up to 30, mostly 10–18) with a size at birth of 60–70 cm TL (Garrick 1967, Compagno 2001). Female age at maturity varies from 18–21 years and maximum age from 28–32 years in New Zealand, the Southwest Pacific, Southwest Atlantic, and Northwest Atlantic Oceans; generation length is therefore 24–25 years (Bishop<em> et al. </em>2006, Natanson <em>et al.</em> 2006, Wells <em>et al.</em> 2013, Doño <em>et al. </em>2014, Barreto <em>et al.</em> 2016b).<p><br/></p>","<p>  </p><p>The Shortfin Mako is caught globally as target and bycatch in pelagic commercial and small-scale longline, purse seine, and gillnet fisheries.

Genetic results indicate one global population, however there is some genetic structuring between ocean basins (Schrey and Heist 2003, Taguchi <em>et al</em>. 2015, Corrigan <em>et al</em>. 2018).<br/><br/>Population trend data are available from four sources: (1) stock assessments in the north Atlantic and south Atlantic (ICCAT 2017); (2) stock assessment in the north Pacific (ISC 2018); (3) standardized catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) in the south Pacific (Francis <em>et al</em>. 2014); and (4) a preliminary stock assessment in the Indian Ocean (Brunel <em>et al</em>. 2018). The trend data from each source were analysed over three generation lengths using a Bayesian state-space framework (a modification of Winker <em>et al</em>. 2018). This analysis yields an annual rate of change, a median change over three generation lengths, and the probability of the most likely IUCN Red List category percent change over three generations (see the Supplementary Information).<br/><br/>First, while the previous north Atlantic stock assessment suggested low probability of overfishing and that stocks were healthy (ICCAT 2012), the most recent north Atlantic stock assessment revealed that the stock was both overfished and that overfishing was occurring (ICCAT 2017). The south Atlantic stock assessment biomass estimates were deemed unreliable by the stock assessors, although they inferred that fishing mortality is likely unsustainable (ICCAT 2017). This concern is corroborated by a recent analysis of standardized catch rates of Shortfin Mako on longlines in the south Atlantic that revealed steep declines of 99% in the average CPUE of 1979–1997 and 1998–2007 (Barreto <em>et al</em>. 2016a). As a result of the unreliable stock assessment, the north Atlantic stock assessment was considered as representative of the south Atlantic for the trend analysis. The trend analysis of the north Atlantic modelled biomass for 1950–2017 (68 years) revealed annual rates of decline of 1.2%, consistent with an estimated median decline of 60.0% over three generation lengths (75 years), with the highest probability of 50–79% reduction over three generation lengths.<br/><br/>Second, the north Pacific stock assessment revealed that the stock was likely not overfished and that overfishing was likely not occurring (ISC 2018). The trend analysis of the modelled spawning abundance for 1975–2016 (42 years) revealed annual rates of decline of 0.6%, consistent with a median decline of 36.5% over three generation lengths (72 years), with the highest probability of 30–49% reduction over three generation lengths. Although the stock assessment used a long data time series of 40 years, the trend analysis considered the population change over a longer period of 72 years, which results in a greater decline than that of the stock assessment.<br/><br/>Third, the New Zealand longline observer Shortfin Mako standardized CPUE for 1995–2013 (19 years) (Francis <em>et al</em>. 2014) was used to represent the catches in that region as it is observer data with good coverage, comes from the part of the region with highest catch rates, and Shortfin Mako move between New Zealand waters and areas further north. The trend analysis indicated annual rates of increase of 0.5%, consistent with a median increase of 35.2% over three generation lengths (72 years), with the highest probability of an increasing population over three generation lengths.<br/><br/>Fourth, the Indian Ocean preliminary stock assessment indicated that the Shortfin Mako stock is not currently overfished but subject to overfishing, however the biomass trajectories trend towards overfished with overfishing status (Brunel <em>et al</em>. 2018). The trend analysis of the biomass for 1971–2015 (45 years) revealed annual rates of decline of 0.9%, consistent with a median decline of 47.9% over three generation lengths (72 years), with the highest probability of 30–49% reduction over three generation lengths.<br/><br/>Further to the above data and trend analyses, steep declines have occurred in the Mediterranean Sea; Ferretti <em>et al</em>. (2008) compiled nine time series of abundance indices from commercial and recreational fishery landings, scientific surveys, and sighting records, to reconstruct long-term population trends of large sharks in the northwestern Mediterranean Sea. Shortfin Mako and Porbeagle (<em>Lamna nasus</em>) showed an average instantaneous rate of decline in abundance of -0.12 (time range 135 years) and biomass of -0.15 (time range 106 years), which equates to an estimated decline of 99.9% in abundance and biomass since the early 19th century (Ferreti <em>et al</em>. 2008).<br/><br/>Across the regions, the Shortfin Mako was estimated to be declining in all oceans, other than the south Pacific where it is increasing. To estimate a global population trend, the estimated three generation population trends for each region were weighted according to the relative size of each region. The overall estimated median reduction was 46.6%, with the highest probability of 50–79% reduction over three generation lengths (72–75 years), and therefore the species is assessed as Endangered A2.",Decreasing,The Shortfin Mako (<em>Isurus oxyrnchus</em>) is widespread in temperate and  tropical waters of all oceans (Ebert <em>et al. </em>2013).,"<p></p><p>This is one of the most valuable shark species due to its high-quality meat.

If the proposal is adopted at the 2019 CITES Conference, Shortfin Mako exports from CITES Parties would need to be accompanied by permits based on findings that parts are sourced from legal and sustainable fisheries.<br/><br/>Globally, there are very few limits on Shortfin Mako catch. In 2012, the General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean (GFCM) banned retention and mandated careful release for the Shortfin Mako and 23 other elasmobranch species listed on the Barcelona Convention Annex II. Implementation by GFCM Parties, however, has been very slow. Whereas the European Union implemented this measure through domestic regulations, it has yet to limit Shortfin Mako catch from anywhere else, even as Spain is consistently the world’s top Shortfin Mako fishing nation. A 2017 measure agreed by the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT)&#160;–&#160;in response to scientific advice to ban retention of overfished north Atlantic Shortfin Makos&#160;–&#160;instead aims to maximize live release by narrowing the conditions under which Shortfin Makos from this population can be landed.<br/><br/>To allow recovery, it is recommended Shortfin Mako landings be prohibited as long as the global population is classified as Endangered.

It is present across the <span class=""apple-converted-space"">Northeast, Eastern Central,  Southwest, and Southeast Atlantic, the Mediterranean Sea, the Eastern  Indian, and across all of the Pacific, except in the Northwest Pacific. It occurs on continental shelves and upper to mid slopes from shallow inshore to well offshore to depths of 826 m, though most frequently to depths of 200 m. Genetic and tagging data support up to six separate subpopulations of Tope and while the species makes extensive movements within each of the subpopulations, there is no evidence of mixing between them. Tope has a particularly low biological productivity with a late age-at-maturity and triennial reproductive cycle. It is caught globally as target and bycatch in industrial and small-scale demersal and pelagic gillnet and longline fisheries, and to a lesser extent in trawl and hook-and-line fisheries. Tope is often retained for the meat and fins but is discarded or released in some areas, in line with regional management measures. Steep subpopulation and stock reductions of &gt;80% over the past three generation lengths (79 years) have occurred in the Southwest Atlantic, southern Africa, and Australia. In the Northeast Atlantic, the subpopulation is estimated to have&#160;<span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space"">undergone a reduction of 76% over the past three generation lengths (79 years). The New Zealand stock is estimated to have undergone a reduction of 30–49% over the past three generation lengths (79 years). In the Northeast Pacific, a dramatic decline in the subpopulation occurred in the early 1940s, with no recovery until 1997<span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space"">–2004 when localized management led to a localized increase in abundance. The consistent steep subpopulation reductions across most of the analyzed subpopulations and stocks together with the lack of movement between the subpopulations are cause for serious concern. Management in Australia, probably aided by the immigration of large mature animals from New Zealand, appears to have stabilized that stock since 2000. The subpopulation in the Northeast Atlantic has been stable in recent years, possibly due to management measures, and there is some recovery in part of the Northeast Pacific.

Some large individuals travel long oceanic distances offshore well away from the continental shelves and slopes, but they do not cross ocean basins (Walker 1999, Walker <em>et al. </em>2008, Colloca <em>et al. </em>2019). Tope sometimes moves diurnally from shallow water at night to deep water by day, and usually occurs in schools, partially segregated by size and sex (Walker <em>et al.</em> 2008). The species has pupping and nursery areas in shallow, protected bays and estuaries where the young can remain for up to two years (Stevens and West 1997, Walker 1999, Walker <em>et al.</em> 2006, Bovcon 2018, McMillan <em>et al</em>. 2018).<br/><br/>The maximum size varies regionally with the largest maximum size of 200 cm total length (TL) in the Mediterranean Sea (Capapé and Mellinger 1998) and the smallest maximum size of 155 cm TL in the Southwest Atlantic (Peres and Vooren 1991). There is also regional variation in size-at-maturity: males mature at 107–170 cm TL and females mature at 118–185 cm TL (Walker <em>et al. </em>2006, Ebert 2013). Reproduction is aplacental viviparous with litter sizes 6–52 (average 20–35), a reproductive cycle that reportedly varies regionally from annual to triennial, although studies with intensive sampling indicate triennial cycles, and a gestation period of ~12 months and size-at-birth that varies regionally from 26–40 cm TL (Peres and Vooren 1991, Walker 1999, Walker 2005, Ebert <em>et al.</em> 2013). Female age-at-maturity varies from 10–15 years (average 12.5 years) and maximum age is estimated as 40 years (tag returns suggest a possible maximum age of 60 years); generation length is therefore

has a long history and ongoing capture as target and bycatch globally in industrial, small-scale, and recreational demersal and pelagic gillnet and longline fisheries, and to a lesser extent in trawl, hook-and-line, troll lines, trammel nets, and traps. Tope is generally retained for the meat, fins, and liver oil (Dent and Clarke 2015). Where it is taken as bycatch, it is mainly retained (as byproduct) but when released, at-vessel-mortality varies by gear: in gillnets, it ranges from 2–73% and on longlines it is reported as 0% (Ellis <em>et al</em>. 2017). <br/><br/>In the Northeast Atlantic, Tope is a bycatch that is discarded in some fisheries but retained in others and is an important target species for recreational fisheries in some areas (ICES 2019). The International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) recommended landings be limited to 376 t annually in 2018 and 2019 (ICES 2019). Landings data are incomplete, as some landings are reported in aggregated landings categories, for example, 'Dogfish and Hounds', and not all range states report species-specific data. The annual reported species-specific Tope landings of the Northeast Atlantic subpopulation (2005–2018) across ICES areas were 542–715 t (ICES 2019). In the western Mediterranean Sea and northwest Africa, the species is a bycatch of a range of fisheries, with landings of 300 t in 2011 (McCully <em>et al</em>. 2015).<br/><br/>In the Southwest Atlantic, the species has been subject to periods of intensive fishing in its entire area of distribution since about the mid-1940s, that includes increasing artisanal fishing pressure (Walker <em>et al. </em>2006). In Uruguay, artisanal fisheries targeting Tope with gillnet and longline were significant fisheries during 1940–1980 but severely declined after 2000 with the disappearance of the Tope targeted with longline (Marín <em>et al</em>. 2020). It is still landed as bycatch of several other fisheries; in Argentina, for example, in 2015 it represented ~2% of the 30,000 t of total chondrichthyan landings, that is ~ 600 t of Tope was landed (Chiaramonte <em>et al</em>. 2016).<br/><br/>In southern Africa, Tope is both targeted and a byproduct with catches of 100–400 t annually in demersal and pelagic line, trawl, gillnet, and recreational fisheries (da Silva <em>et al</em>. 2015, Winker <em>et al</em>. 2019).<br/><br/>In the Northeast Pacific, Tope is taken as bycatch at low levels with the main fisheries in which it is taken declining in effort due to implementation of management measures (Walker <em>et al. </em>2006, COSEWIC 2007). Demersal trawl and trammel net fisheries targeting groundfish landed small quantities of Tope in California during 1876‒1936. In response to a demand for shark liver oil beginning in 1937, a gillnet fishery expanded rapidly throughout Californian Pacific waters and south along the Baja Peninsular in Mexico and into the Gulf of California (Ripley 1946, Walker 1999), and subsequently north to Canadian waters off British Columbia (Fisheries and Oceans Canada 2012). The catch peaked at &gt;4,000 t (live mass) in 1939 and then rapidly fell to 287 t by 1944 with the depletion of stocks (Walker 1999). About 840,000 individuals, primarily large adults, were killed for their livers from 1937‒1949, of which ~40,000 were landed in Canadian ports and an additional unknown number were caught off, but landed outside, Canada (Fisheries and Oceans Canada 2012). Recent Canadian bycatch has averaged 0.5 t/year and 1.8 t/year since 2006 in the trawl and hook and line fisheries, respectively, with mandatory release since 2011. During 1976‒1994, of 100‒380 t of Tope landed on the US west coast, most was landed in California, but during 1990‒2004 catch levels in California were about half those during 1977‒1989 (Cailliet <em>et al</em>. 1993, Pondella and Allen 2008). Landings in US waters for 1990–2016 totalled 840 t, of which 816 t was caught in California (NOAA 2018). Estimates of the catches during a long history of recreational fishing are unavailable (Ebert 2001).<br/><br/>In Australia, the fishing effort on this species is mainly in the Shark Gillnet and Shark Hook sectors of the Southern and Eastern Scalefish and Shark Fishery (SESSF). Tope was historically the main target species, but since its biomass was reduced by 1990, it is now a byproduct of targeting Gummy Shark (<em>Mustelus antarcticus</em>), with the take of Tope strictly managed to reduce catch and to support its recovery through a total allowable catch (TAC) of 225 t, closed areas, and trip limits; annual catches are now ~150–200 t (Woodhams and Curotti 2018). Catches across the rest of Australia are much lower at ~24 t annually (Woodhams and Curotti 2018). In New Zealand, catches of this species peaked in 1984 and have been ~3,000 t annually with a current TAC of 3,107 t.<br/><br/>In the Southeast Pacific, catches of Tope throughout the waters of Ecuador, Peru, and Chile are low despite intensive and diverse fisheries, including the widespread use of gillnets of mesh sizes 50–200 mm (Reyes and Oporto 1994, Doherty 2014), which are particularly efficient for the capture of the species. In Ecuador and Peru, there is no mention of Tope in chondrichthyan species reported to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (Martinez 1999, Anon. 2014). In Chile during 1976–1995, reported annual catches were often zero but increased from zero to 11 ton in 1979, to a peak of 36 ton in 1980, and then decreased to 6 ton in 1992, and subsequently to zero (Pequeño and Lamilla 1997). Since that time, official landings statistics to 2017 include only 1 ton for 2009. As an unimportant fishery product, much of the catch is likely unreported (F. Concha, Biología y Conservación de Condrictios, Universidad de Valparaíso, Chile, pers. comm. 20 January 2020). Visual inspection and DNA testing of landed shark fins in Chile also indicate low catches of Tope (Sebastian <em>et al</em>. 2008).<br/><br/>Indirect and sublethal sources of mortality are habitat degradation in potential nursery areas that can negatively affect recruitment, and installation of high voltage direct current sub-sea cables across their migration lanes that may affect feeding and navigation (Walker <em>et al. </em>2006).","<span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span

class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span class=""apple-converted-space"">Genetic and tagging data support up to six separate subpopulations of Tope (Ward and Gardner 1997, Chabot and Allen 2009, Chabot 2015, Hernández <em>et al</em>. 2015, Devloo-Delva <em>et al. </em>2019): Northeast Atlantic (including the Mediterranean Sea), southern Africa (Namibia to East London, South Africa), Southwest Atlantic (southern Brazil to Patagonia), Northeast Pacific (British Columbia to southern Baja California including the Gulf of California), Southeast Pacific (Ecuador to Chile), and Australasia (Australia and New Zealand). There is evidence of some genetic similarity between the South American subpopulations (Bester-van der Merwe <em>et al. </em>2017). Within each of the six subpopulations, the species makes extensive movements, but there is no evidence of mixing among the separate genetically-distinct subpopulations (Chabot 2015, Hernández <em>et al. </em>2015).<br/><br/>Population trend data are available from five sources: (1) standardized catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) in the Northeast Atlantic and Mediterranean Sea (ICES 2019); (2) nominal CPUE in the Southwest Atlantic (G. Chiaramonte unpubl. data 2019); (3) stock assessment biomass from South Africa (Winker <em>et al. </em>2019. H. Winker pers. comm. 21 January 2020); (4) stock assessment biomass from Australia (Thomas and Punt 2009); and, (5) standardized CPUE from longline and gillnet in New Zealand (Dunn and Bian 2018). The trend data from each source were analyzed over three generation lengths using a Bayesian state-space framework (Sherley<em> et al.</em> 2019, Winker and Sherley 2019). This analysis yields an annual rate of change, a median change over three generation lengths, and the probability of the most likely IUCN Red List Category percent change over three generations (see the Supplementary Information).<br/><br/>First, in the Northeast Atlantic and Mediterranean Sea, three fishery-independent survey standardized CPUE were available from the northern (2005–2018) and southern areas (1997–2016) of the Celtic Seas Ecoregion (all trawl data) and from the Azores (1990–2015) (longline data) (ICES 2019). An exploratory trend analysis was undertaken that included these three surveys and additional trawl survey data from the North Sea (1992–2016; ICES 2019). However, given that ICES (2019) identified likely taxonomic confusion between Tope and Smooth-hound (<em>Mustelus</em> spp.) in some of the North Sea trawl survey data, the North Sea data were excluded from the present assessment. The three fishery-independent datasets were used to also represent the Mediterranean Sea, as that is part of the Northeast Atlantic Tope subpopulation (Colloca <em>et al. </em>2019). Data from the MEDITS trawl survey program in the Mediterranean Sea (1994–2015) was not reported as CPUE and as such, was not able to be included in the trend analyses, however it indicated that Tope has a low frequency of occurrence (Ramírez-Amaro <em>et al.</em> 2020). The Northeast Atlantic survey data may not be fully representative of stock status due to the low catchability of Tope in these fishery-independent surveys and annual peaks associated with large catches of individual hauls; as such, caution is advised in interpretation of these data (ICES 2019). The combined data indicate declining catches till the 2000s when catches began to slowly increase. The trend analysis of these survey data combined for 1990–2018 (29 years) revealed annual rates of reduction of 1.7%, consistent with an estimated median reduction of 76.6% over three generation lengths (79 years), with the highest probability of &gt;80% reduction over three generation lengths. This trend is largely driven by higher catch rates at the start of the time-series, with data from the latter part of the time-series indicating more stable trends (ICES 2019). The exploratory analyses that included the North Sea data resulted in a reduction of 91.5% over three generation lengths, yet the differences in the trend analyses for this subpopulation between inclusion and exclusion of the North Sea data did not affect the likely status of the overall global trend analysis.<br/><br/>Second, in the Southwest Atlantic, Tope declined dramatically in importance in the commercial chondrichthyan catch in Argentina, declining from 40% to 2% during 1984–2015, where the Tope fishery also collapsed at the end of the century (Chiaramonte <em>et al.</em> 2016). A matrix population model of data from Bahía San Blas found a decrease in the subpopulation at an average annual rate of 6.7% to 12.8% from 1998–2001 (Lucifora 2003). The nominal CPUE from Argentina for 1992–2015 (24 years) was available from demersal trawl fisheries (referred to as 'coastal' and 'ice' trawlers in Argentina) (G. Chiaramonte unpubl. data 2019). The trend analysis revealed annual rates of reduction of 5.9%, consistent with an estimated median reduction of 99.3% over three generation lengths (79 years), with the highest probability of &gt;80% reduction over three generation lengths.<br/><br/>Third, in South Africa, a JABBA stock assessment indicated declining stocks for 1952–2016 (65 years) (Winker <em>et al.</em> 2019). The current biomass is 10–14% of pre-exploitation levels (Winker <em>et al.</em> 2019). The data used for the assessment was from scientific surveys and commercial catches in the demersal shark longline, line, and trawl fisheries (Winker <em>et al.</em> 2019). The trend analysis of the biomass estimates from the stock assessment (H. Winker pers. comm. 21 January 2020) revealed annual rates of reduction of 3.1%, consistent with an estimated median reduction of 91.4% over three generation lengths (79 years), with the highest probability of &gt;80% reduction over three generation lengths.<br/><br/>Fourth, in Australia, stock assessments indicated that the current biomass is &lt;20% of unexploited levels and the stock is considered overfished (Patterson<em> et al. </em>2018). Trawl CPUE available since ~1994 is considered a poor indicator of the abundance of Tope in southern Australia because the catch is predominantly large males mostly taken in small numbers from a small part of the species’ range in deep water. Changes in targeting practices by the fishers since 2001 create the same issue of bias as for gillnet CPUE. Since 2001, catches of Tope have been managed with a low total allowable catch (TAC) and this catch has been stable, albeit at a very low level. The biomass is classed by the Australian government as overfished at a level below 20% of the pre-fishing level and the fishing mortality is classed uncertain (Patterson <em>et al. </em>2018). The trend analysis of the stock assessment abundance for 1927–2000 (74 years) revealed annual rates of reduction of 2.8%, consistent with an estimated median reduction of 90.1% over three generation lengths (79 years), with the highest probability of &gt;80% reduction over three generation lengths.<br/><br/>Fifth, in New Zealand, standardized catch-per-unit-effort was available for longline from 5 areas and for gillnet from 4 areas (Dunn and Bian 2018). The combined data show a general decline during the 1990s followed by a rise in catches in the early 2000s and then fluctuations in catches across areas and gear (Dunn and Bian 2018). The high fluctuations in these data may be due to varying patterns of fishing and/or migration of Tope both spatially and temporally. The trend analysis of the combined longline and gillnet data from 1990–2016 (27 years) revealed annual rates of reduction of 0.5%, consistent with an estimated median reduction of 29.8% over three generation lengths (79 years), with the highest probability of 30–49% reduction over three generation lengths. Whilst Australia and New Zealand are part of the same subpopulation, they are treated as separate stocks for the purposes of fisheries and conservation management, and risk assessments within Australia and New Zealand. The exchange of large mature animals between the two stocks of Australia and New Zealand has been established by tag release-recapture (Hurst <em>et al. </em>2008, Walker<em> et al.</em> 2008), and some interbreeding between the two stocks established by genetic studies (Hernández <em>et al. </em>2015). However, most animals in the two stocks are too small to move across the Tasman Sea and there are separate pupping grounds in Australia and New Zealand.<br/><br/>In addition, in the Northeast Pacific, in California, a historic targeted Tope fishery collapsed due to overfishing from 1938–1944 (Pondella and Allen 2008). This dramatic decline occurred ~76 years ago, almost three generation lengths (79 years). The subpopulation did not show any signs of recovery until prohibitions in 1994 on the use of inshore gillnets and trammel nets. The prohibitions were for the White Sea Bass (<em>Atractosciaon nobilis</em>) and Giant Sea Bass (<em>Stereolepis gigas</em>) but also reduced the catch of inshore Tope. Gillnet surveys in the southern California Bight showed an increasing trend of Tope during 1977–2004 (Pondella and Allen 2008). Given there was no increase in the total Californian commercial landings of Tope during 1997–2004 (Pondella and Allen 2008), the rise in the CPUE during the surveys is more consistent with a localized increase in the abundance from the combined effects of improved survival of young animals inshore and older animals recolonizing inshore waters, rather than indicative of a widespread increase in abundance of Tope in all Californian waters. It does indicate, however, that localized stocks can recover following management that prohibits catch.<br/><br/>Across the regions with analysed subpopulation and stock trends, Tope was estimated to have steeply declined in the Southwest Atlantic, southern Africa, Australia, and to a lesser extent in the Northeast Atlantic and New Zealand. All of these subpopulations and stocks, with the exception of New Zealand, are estimated to have the highest probability to have undergone a reduction of &gt;80% over three generation lengths (79 years). In New Zealand, the stock is estimated to have undergone a reduction of 30–49% over three generation lengths (79 years). The data quality used for the trend estimates varies from robust stock assessments in Australia and South Africa, to standardized CPUE in Northeast Atlantic (noting the caveats above) and New Zealand, and nominal CPUE in Southwest Atlantic; the CPUEs may not fully represent actual abundances but are the best available data. In the Northeast Pacific, the subpopulation collapsed in the early 1940s, with no recovery until 1997–2004 when localized management led to localized increase in abundance. The consistent steepness of decline across most of the analyzed time-series over the past three generation lengths together with the lack of movement between the subpopulations is cause for serious concern. The trend data were used for the estimation of a global population trend; the estimated three generation subpopulation trend for each region was weighted according to the relative size of each region. The overall estimated median reduction was 88%, with the highest probability of a &gt;80% reduction over three generation lengths (79 years).<br/><br/><span class=""apple-converted-space""><span

is widely distributed in cold to warm temperate waters of most oceans. It occurs in the Northeast, Eastern Central, Southwest and Southeast Atlantic, the Mediterranean Sea, the Eastern Indian, and in the Southwest, Southeast, Western Central, Eastern Central, and Northeast Pacific. It is absent from the Northwest and Western Central Atlantic, the Northwest Pacific, and the Western Indian (Ebert <em>et al</em>. 2013).","Tope is used for its meat and fins, and historically for the liver oil (Walker <em>et al</em>. 2006, Dent and Clarke 2015, Fields <em>et al. </em>2018).",Marine,"There are some regulations in place for Tope. In 2020, Tope was listed on Appendix II of the Convention on Migratory Species (CMS), which obligates Parties to work regionally toward conservation, specifically through the CMS Memorandum of Understanding for Migratory Sharks.<br/><br/>In the Northeast Atlantic, European Union vessels are prohibited to land Tope captured on longlines over a large part of its northern European range in International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) waters (ICES 2019). In the United Kingdom, since 2008, it has been prohibited to fish for Tope other than using rod and line (with anglers fishing using rod and line from boats not allowed to land their catch) with bycatch of Tope caught in other commercial gears limited to 45 kilograms per day (ICES 2019). In the Mediterranean Sea, the General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean (GFCM) in 2012 banned retention and mandated careful release for Tope and 23 other elasmobranch species listed on the Barcelona Convention Annex II.<br/><br/>In the Southwest Atlantic, seasonal no-take areas provide some protection to Tope. Like other large sharks, Tope is protected by regional, national, and provincial legislation in Argentina whereby all sharks larger than 160 cm TL (the largest Tope in Southwest Atlantic is 155 cm TL) must be discarded alive and cannot be landed in any Argentinean port (Undersecretariat of Fisheries, Ministry of Environment, Ministry of Foreign Affairs 2009). The Province of Buenos Aires prohibits the landing of Tope in recreational fisheries (Ministry of Agrarian Affairs, Province of Buenos Aires 2007). However, enforcement is difficult and large sharks are still landed.<br/><br/>In Australia, the species was listed as Conservation Dependent in 2009 on the <em>Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 </em>(EPBC Act), and there is a species-specific School Shark Rebuilding Strategy and other management measures to reduce catch (DEE 2009, AFMA 2015, Woodhams and Curtotti 2018). These measures in southern Australia include: all live-caught Tope to be released, limited entry for the use of gillnets and longlines, total allowable catch, gear restrictions, and permanent and seasonal closures for nursery and breeding areas (Walker 1999, Walker and Gason 2007, Woodhams and Curtotti 2018). Spatial closures to the Shark Gillnet Sector were implemented in all Victorian coastal waters (within 3 nautical miles of shore) since 1988, and in South Australia implemented since 2003 (Penney <em>et al.</em> 2014). The Commonwealth South-East and South-West Marine Park Networks implemented since 2013 provide refuge for Tope. <br/><br/>In New Zealand, Tope are managed under the Quota Management System with Individual Transferable Quotas (Finucci <em>et al.</em> 2019). They are also included in recreational bag limits of 20–30 fish per day.<br/><br/>In the mortheast Pacific, Tope was designated as Special Concern by COSEWIC in 2007 and was listed under Canada’s Species at Risk Act, Schedule 1 as Special Concern in 2009. Careful mandatory release in Canada since 2011 and 100% observer cover to monitor release has resulted in a very low level of mortality. A management plan for Tope was created by Fisheries and Oceans Canada in 2012, calling for more research on the species’ ecology and biology in Canadian waters, in addition to ongoing improvements to bycatch information.<br/><br/>Further research is required on population size and trends, and catch rates should be monitored.<span class=""apple-converted-space""><span

2915850,39381,Prionace glauca,Near Threatened,A2bd,2019,2018-11-06 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The Blue Shark (<em>Prionace glauca</em>) is a large (to 380 cm TL) oceanic pelagic shark wide-ranging throughout tropical and temperate waters from the surface down to 1,000 m deep. The species has the highest known population growth rates among pelagic sharks; it matures young and has large litters. It is caught globally as target and bycatch in commercial and small-scale pelagic longline, purse seine, and gillnet fisheries, although most of the take is bycatch of industrial pelagic fleets in offshore and high-seas waters. Generally, Blue Sharks are retained for the fins, although the demand for meat is likely increasing. The steepest population declines have occurred in the North and South Atlantic, with lesser declines in the Indian Ocean, and increases in the Pacific. The weighted global population trend estimated a median decline of 7.3%, with the highest probability of &lt;20%  reduction over three generation lengths (30–31.5 years). <span lang=""EN-CA"">However, due to uncertainty in some of the regional estimated trends, <span lang=""EN-CA"">inferred steep historic declines in the Mediterranean Sea,<span lang=""EN-CA""> high levels of unregulated exploitation, and high levels of international trade in meat and fins, <span lang=""EN-CA"">experts estimated a global population reduction of 20–29% over three generation<span lang=""EN-CA""> and the Blue Shark is assessed as Near Threatened (nearly meeting Vulnerable A2bd).</span></span>","The Blue Shark is an oceanic pelagic shark, that occurs close inshore where the continental shelf is narrow (Last and Stevens 2009), and is found from the surface down to depths  of 1,000 m (Weigmann 2016). It also occurs in inshore waters where the continental shelf is narrow (Last and Stevens 2009). The Blue Shark is highly migratory with movement patterns associated with  reproduction and prey distribution (Nakano and Stevens 2008). The species reaches a maximum size of  about 380 cm total length (TL) (Hart 1973). Males mature at 183–218 cm TL, females mature at 183–221 cm TL (Pratt 1979, Nakano 1994, Carrera-Fernandez <em>et al</em>. 2010). Reproduction is placental viviparous with a gestation of 9–12 months, an annual to biennial reproductive cycle, and large litters sizes of 4–135 (usually 25–35), with a size at birth of 35–60 cm TL (Pratt 1979, Stevens 1984, Nakano 1994, Hazin <em>et al.</em> 1994, Clarke <em>et al</em>. 2015). There is minor regional variation in female age at maturity  at 5–6 years in the Atlantic and 5–8 years in the Pacific with a maximum  age of 15.5–16 years in both regions; generation length is therefore 10  years in the Atlantic and 10.5 years in the Pacific (Nakano 1994,  Skomal and  Natanson 2003, Blanco-Parra <em>et al.</em> 2008, Jolly <em>et al</em>. 2013). There are age studies with a greater maximum age of up to 28.6 years, however these are theoretical longevity estimates and the maximum ages have not been validated (Hsu <em>et al. </em>2011, 2012, 2015; Rice and Semba 2014,&#160;Andrade <em>et al.</em> 2019).   The Blue Shark has the highest known population growth rates for pelagic sharks; that is, 0.287–0.314 in the North Atlantic, 0.299 in  the South Atlantic, and 0.264–0.331 in the Indian Ocean (Dulvy <em>et al.</em> 2008, Cortes <em>et al.</em> 2015, Murua <em>et al.</em> 2018).","<p>  </p><p>The Blue Shark is caught globally as target and bycatch in commercial and small-scale pelagic&#160;longline, purse seine, and gillnet fisheries. Most of the catch is taken as bycatch of industrial pelagic fleets in offshore and high-seas waters (Camhi <em>et al.</em> 2008). It is also captured in coastal longlines, gillnets, trammel nets, and sometimes trawls, particularly in areas with narrow continental shelves (Camhi <em>et al.</em> 2008, Martinez-Ortiz <em>et al.</em> 2015).&#160;</p><p>The species is generally retained for the meat and fins (Clarke <em>et al.</em> 2006a<em>,&#160;</em>Clarke&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2006b, Dent and Clarke 2015<em>,</em> Fields <em>et al.</em> 2018), unless regulations prohibit retention<em>.</em> Under-reporting of catches in the pelagic and domestic fisheries is likely (Dent and Clarke 2015).<em> </em>The species is highly valued by big-game recreational fishers, and although many practice catch and release, recreational fishing could be a threat due to post-release mortality (Camhi <em>et al.</em> 2008). At-vessel hooking mortality from commercial Portuguese longlines in the Atlantic is relatively low (13.3%), but smaller individuals have higher probabilities of mortality than larger adults (Coelho <em>et al. </em>2013). The post-release mortality of only a few pelagic shark species has been studied. It has been reported as 10–35% for the Blue Shark (Campana <em>et al.</em> 2009, 2016). The species is taken in beach protection programs that target large sharks (Dudley and Simpfendorfer 2006, Simpfendorfer <em>et al.</em> 2010, Reid <em>et al.</em> 2011).</p>","<p>There are no data available on the absolute global population size of the Blue Shark. Genetic results suggest one global population, with weak or no differentiation within and between ocean basins (Ovenden <em>et al. </em>2009, King <em>et al.</em> 2015, Leone&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2017, Verissimo <em>et al.</em> 2017, Bailleul&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018).</p><p>Population trend data are available from five stock assessment sources: (1) in the North Atlantic (ICCAT 2015); (2) in the South Atlantic (Carvalho and Winker 2015); (3) in the North Pacific (ISC 2017); (4) in the South Pacific (Takeuchi <em>et al.</em> 2016); and, (5) in the Indian Ocean (Rice 2017). The trend data from each source were analyzed over three generation lengths using a Bayesian state-space framework (a modification of Winker <em>et al. </em>2018). This analysis yields an annual rate of change, a median change over three generation lengths, and the probability of the most likely IUCN Red List category percent change over three generations (see the Supplementary Information).  </p><p>First, the North Atlantic stock assessment estimated that the stock was unlikely to be overfished and not subject to overfishing, and although there was some uncertainty in the assessment, this was a similar outcome to the 2008 stock assessment (ICCAT 2015). The trend analysis of the North Atlantic spawning biomass for 1971–2013 (43 years) revealed annual rates of reduction of 2.3%, consistent with an estimated median reduction of 53.9% over three generation lengths (30 years), with the highest probability of 50–79% reduction over three generation lengths.</p><p>  </p><p>Second, the South Atlantic stock assessment estimated that stock was unlikely to be overfished and not subject to overfishing, however there was unsustainable harvest during 1991–2011, and any future increase in fishing mortality could cause the stock to be overfished and experience overfishing (Carvalho and Winker 2015, ICCAT 2015). The trend analysis of the South Atlantic exploitable biomass for 1971–2013 (43 years) revealed annual rates of reduction of 1.5%, consistent with an estimated median reduction of 38.2% over three generation lengths (30 years), with the highest probability of 30–49% reduction over three generation lengths</p>  <p></p><p>Third, the North Pacific stock assessment indicated that the stock was not overfished and overfishing was not occurring (ISC 2017). The trend analysis of the North Pacific spawning biomass for 1971–2015 (45 years) revealed annual rates of change of -0.1% to +0.4% over one generation, consistent with an estimated median increase of 8.5% over three generation lengths (31.5 years), with the highest probability of an increase over three generation lengths. <br/></p><p>Fourth, the South Pacific stock assessment was inconclusive and considered a work in progress (Takeuchi <em>et al.</em> 2017). The trend analysis of the Southwest Pacific spawning biomass for 1994–2014 (21 years) revealed annual rates of increase of 0.2%, consistent with an estimated  median increase of 5.7% over three generation lengths (31.5 years), with  the highest probability of an increase over three generation lengths.</p><p>Fifth, the Indian Ocean stock assessment indicated that the stock was not overfished but may be experiencing overfishing (Rice 2017, IOTC 2017). The trend analysis of the Indian Ocean biomass for 1949–2016 (68 years) revealed annual rates of reduction of 0.2%, consistent with an estimated  median reduction of 8.4% over three generation lengths (31.5 years), with  the highest probability of a &lt;20% reduction over three generation lengths.</p><p>  </p><p>Further to the above stock assessment trend analyses, steep declines have occurred in the Mediterranean Sea. Ferretti <em>et al.</em> (2008) compiled nine time-series of abundance indices from commercial and recreational fishery landings, scientific surveys, and sighting records, to reconstruct long-term population trends of large sharks in the northwestern Mediterranean Sea. The Blue Shark showed an average instantaneous rate of decline in abundance of -0.06 (time range 56 years) and biomass of -0.13 (time range 49 years), which equates to an estimated decline of 96.5–99.8% in abundance and biomass since the early 19th century (Ferretti <em>et al. </em>2008). In the previous ten years, a partial increase in artisanal catches has been observed in the northwestern Mediterranean Sea.</p><p></p><p>  </p><p>Across the regions, the Blue Shark was estimated to be declining in the North and South Atlantic and Indian Oceans, and increasing in the North and South Pacific. To estimate a global population trend, the estimated three generation population trends for each region were weighted according to the relative size of each region. The overall estimated median reduction was 7.3%, with the highest probability of &lt;20% reduction over three generation lengths (30–31.5 years). However, due to uncertainty in some of the regional estimated trends, inferred declines in the Mediterranean Sea, high levels of exploitation and trade in meat and fins,&#160;<span lang=""EN-US"">expert judgement&#160;elicitation&#160;was used to estimate a global population reduction of 20–29% over three generation lengths (30–31.5 years). Therefore, the Blue Shark is assessed as NT (nearly meeting Vulnerable A2bd).</p>",Decreasing,"The Blue Shark is one of the most wide-ranging of all sharks, found throughout all oceans in tropical and temperate waters (Last and Stevens 1994, Ebert&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2013).","<p>  </p><p>The Blue Shark is the most prevelent species in the shark fin trade. It comprises the majority of shark fins imported in Hong Kong; 17.3% in 1991–2001 and 49% in 2014 (Clarke <em>et al.</em> 2006a, Fields <em>et al. </em>2018).

The observer data trends from this fishery were analysed over three generation lengths using a Bayesian state-space framework (a modification of Winker <em>et al. </em>2018). This analysis yields an annual rate of change, a median change over three generation lengths, and the probability of the most likely Red List Category percent change over three generations (see the Supplementary Information). The observer data were considered more reliable than the logbook data reported in Lynch <em>et al. </em>(2018).  The observer modelled catch rate data for 1992–2015 (24 years) showed declines to  the mid 1990s, followed by an increase to the mid 2000s and declines  thereafter (J. Carslon unpubl. data).

Regions with no trend data are assumed to have declined by 0 to 100% (this range excludes the possibility that the regional trend may have increased), and a global trend estimated that incorporates this uncertainty.

The median and mean rate of change across the 62 assessed populations indicate an expanding global population (9.0 and 72.4 % increase, respectively, over the past three generations), thus there is no evidence of risk to the species under Red List A2 criterion. With an estimated geographic range of 11.5 million km², there is no evidence of threat to the global population under criterion B1 (Table 1). Similarly, at 1.9 million km² of current occupancy (freshwater basin area), there is no evidence of threat under criterion B2 (Table 1). Approximately 7% of the historical range of Sockeye Salmon has been lost due to localized extinction events, but we conclude the species is not threatened globally.<br/><br/>For all Figures, Tables and more details about the methods used for this assessment, see the Supplementary Material.","The species exhibits a great variety of life history patterns. It has a life history form called “Kokanee” that lives its entire life within freshwater, but this assessment includes only anadromous populations commonly referred to as “Sockeye” or “Red Salmon”. Sockeye are born in gravel nests in rivers or lakes and the majority of life history forms rear as juveniles for one to three years in freshwater before migrating to the ocean. Some Sockeye assume a river-type life history and rear in a river channel, while others are lake-type and rear in a lake environment. Primary prey during this life history stage include zooplankton and stream invertebrates. Some sea-type populations migrate within one to three months following emergence, and these make extensive use of estuaries. Most populations spend one to three years in offshore feeding areas where they grow to maturity (ca. 50-60 cm total length, 2.5-3.0 kg weight). Diet in the ocean consists primarily of zooplankton (copepods and euphausiids), but their diet also includes squids and fishes. Natural predators during this period in their life history include Salmon Sharks (<em>Lamna ditropis</em>) and Daggertooth (<em>Anotopterus nikparini</em>). Foraging individuals mix among populations both within and between Asia and North America, but at maturity they all migrate back toward their natal freshwater habitat where they spawn and die. The return to natal habitat and the isolation of spawning populations results in considerable genetic differentiation and adaptation to local conditions. Many fish are intercepted by fishers during the homeward, spawning migration, and natural predators include seals, sea lions and bears. Spawning occurs in late summer and autumn, in lake outlet or lake tributary streams or along lake beaches in finer sediments where subterranean upwelling occurs or among boulders on wave-aerated shores. River-type Sockeye spawn in river channels not associated with lakes. Adults display bright red bodies and green heads. Males compete with each other for access to females. Females compete with each other for gravel sites where they build nests, deposit eggs (fecundity typically ranges from 2,000–5,000 eggs), and briefly guard the redd. Median population size for the species is <em>ca</em>. 6,000 individuals. Reviews of life history and ecology of the species appear in Smith <em>et al</em>. (1987), Burgner (1991), Wood (1995) and Quinn (2005).","<strong></strong>The key threats to the species identified by the IUCN SSC Salmon Specialist Group were: <br/><ol><li>Mixed stock fishing leading to over fishing small, less productive populations</li><li>Changing river and ocean conditions that are likely linked to global climate change, expressed in poor marine survival rates and increased incidence of disease in adult spawners</li><li>Negative effects of hatcheries and construction of artificial spawning habitat </li></ol>It is important to note that in many cases, the causes for declines in some specific Sockeye Salmon subpopulations remain unknown.","At the species level, the population is believed to be stable; however, some subpopulations are declining.

This occurs primarily in the Russian portion of their natural range, and the fishery is illegal and the take is unreported.",Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,"1. Many subpopulations of Sockeye in British Columbia were found to be threatened based on this assessment. Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO) is responsible for salmon management and is currently formulating conservation units (Holtby and Ciruna, unpublished manuscript) and initiating new policy (e.g,. Wild Salmon Policy) and procedures to stem the loss in diversity (DFO 2005, Irvine and Fraser 2008). Two locations of Sockeye Salmon, Sakinaw Lake and Cultus Lake, have been assessed and listed as Endangered by the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC). However, the federal government has declined protection under the Species at Risk Act (SARA) due to the social and economic costs of closures to the fishery (Irvine <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2005). We encourage COSEWIC and DFO to focus attention on those subpopulations that we identified as threatened in this IUCN assessment.<br/><br/>2. We considered Ozette Lake, Lake Pleasant and Quinault Lake Sockeye Salmon as individual spawning sites in a larger subpopulation (SEASONAL UPWELLING). These lake systems are recognized individually as Evolutionarily Significant Units (ESUs) by National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The latter two sites were not included in the genetic baseline applied in this assessment, thus we assumed all sites are members of a larger, parent subpopulation. Further, we did not include Ozette Lake in our assessment given the recent escapement data available for the native beach-spawning population at that location is obscured by repeated attempts at establishing a tributary spawning population originating from broodstock taken from outside the basin. We encourage efforts at expanding the range-wide microsatellite-DNA baseline to include Lake Pleasant and Quinault Lake, and to investigate the status of the native beach-spawning Sockeye in Ozette Lake.<br/><br/>3. Most of the data used in our assessment, particularly in Alaska, were from large aggregate stocks that may contain many (sometimes 100s) of individual spawning sites, and hence may mask important dynamics occurring at small scales. While a number of recent studies have shown that there is a significant degree of coherence among populations within a given region, it is important to acknowledge that a majority of the variability in vital rates are not explained by regional, environmental drivers, and may result from localized threats, for example road or other infrastructural development, or by different life history characteristics which affect productivity. Where possible and feasible, we recommend a more comprehensive monitoring approach that addresses dynamics at the scale of individual spawning sites. An excellent example of this approach is the Wood River system in Alaska’s Bristol Bay region, where a combination of sampling approaches provides a more integrated monitoring system that translates into a robust assessment of the status of the species in that basin.<br/><br/>4. Mixed-stock fishing is likely to be a key factor in the decline observed at many sites and subpopulations in our assessment. We feel a key priority is filling a gap in knowledge about composition of mixed-stock harvest in coastal Sockeye Salmon fisheries. While a great deal of resources has been invested in developing weak-stock management for Fraser River Sockeye Salmon through the Pacific Salmon Commission and DFO, there has been much less attention placed in other regions along the west coast of North America, particularly in the regions where we found the greatest diversity of subpopulations. We encourage continued investment in developing methods and protocols to account for subpopulation composition of coastal fisheries targeting Sockeye salmon to help track harvest pressure at a biologically and ecologically meaningful scale. Further, we encourage fisheries management agencies to explore restructuring fisheries in a way that would result in shifting fishing pressure from coastal regions to more terminal locations, thus providing a more effective means of controlling fishing pressure at the scale of individual subpopulations.<br/><br/>5. Another leading factor threatening Sockeye Salmon are poor marine survival rates. This has been documented in cases where smolt-to-adult survival rates are estimated through intensive monitoring programs. This appears to be a significant factor explaining declines in adult abundance across many locations in the southern range of the species in North America. While marine conditions have been shown to cycle based on climate forcing and may, in fact, improve in future years, we feel it is important for those managing salmon in this region to acknowledge that poor marine survival may persist, particularly given projections based on global climate change. Reversing declining trends in those subpopulations affected may require increased attention to agents of mortality that are occurring at other life history stages over which we have more local control.<br/><br/>6. Many previous attempts at re-introductions of Sockeye Salmon have been unsuccessful, and we feel any effort at captive breeding or inter-basin transfers for reintroduction purposes should proceed with great caution. These efforts, to the extent that they exist, are at best stop-gap measures and are in no way a substitute for conserving the species in the wild. The lack of success from the captive breeding of endangered Sakinaw Sockeye Salmon by DFO, and endangered Redfish Lake Sockeye by NMFS, are examples of the limitations to these expensive measures. Recent evidence of re-establishment of anadromous runs of Sockeye from remnant, isolated Kokanee populations following dam removal or modification (e.g., Allouette Lake in British Columbia) may offer hope in re-establishing anadromous life histories in cases where dams have prevented passage.<br/><br/>7. Enhancement activities (particularly hatchery releases and spawning channel construction) is likely to be a key factor in reducing abundance in neighbouring, small wild populations. In our assessment, we were unable to functionally track both wild and enhanced Sockeye Salmon where they intermingle. We strongly recommend adoption of integrated monitoring programs that includes a robust marking program and monitoring efforts targeted toward wild Sockeye Salmon populations that would provide the data necessary to address the degree to which enhancement practices threaten wild Sockeye Salmon. It is important to note that two large basins in our assessment (Fraser and Skeena) are all strongly. influenced by enhancement activities, and these activities likely represent a key factor threatening many neighbouring subpopulations.<br/><br/>8. While not addressed in the present assessment due to lack of data, we feel there should be more focused research attention on sea-and river-type Sockeye that may serve as colonizers in the future. This line of research is particularly important given expected habitat alterations from climate change.<br/>&#160;<br/>9. Very few data were available to assess population viability of Sockeye Salmon in the Russian Far East, and we document a significant reduction in escapement in recent years at a site within the Kamchatka River basin that warranted an endangered listing for this subpopulation. The leading threat recognized for this subpopulation is overfishing. The situation has been exacerbated by an increase in illegal fishing practices. We encourage the leading agencies in this region to provide more open access to data, and supporting meta-data, for assessment purposes. We also encourage development of new monitoring efforts throughout the region and increased enforcement to reduce poaching. Many populations of river-type Sockeye exist, particularly in western Kamchatka, and focused research on these populations will provide important insight into the status of the species there.",Nearctic|Palearctic,,false,false,Global

Commercial catch is taken mostly by surface long lining with less than 1% of the total catch taken by harpooning. The quality of the flesh is among the best of the billfishes for sashimi and sushi. It marketed mostly frozen, sometimes fresh. The observed distribution of several large pelagic predators, including the striped marlin, has significantly contracted from the 1960s to 2000 (Worm and Tittensor 2011).<br/><br/>In the western central Pacific Ocean (WCPO), catches of Striped Marlin were dominated by the Japanese longline fleet until the early 1990s. Taiwanese and Korean fleets have reported relatively small catches of Striped Marlin since the mid 1960s and mid 1970s, respectively. However, Taiwanese catches have increased in recent years, mainly due to the high effort of this fleet in the eastern temperate WCPO, targeting mainly Albacore Tuna. Longline fleets of Pacific Island Countries and Territories, and by Australia and New Zealand, have reported increasing catches since the early 1990s mainly due to the development of these domestic fleets. Catches by Australian longline fleets have rapidly increased in recent years due, at least in part, to specific targeting of striped marlin by some vessels during some periods. Since 1987, longline fleets operating in the New Zealand Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) have been prohibited from landing Striped Marlin in an attempt support recreational fisheries in the north of the country (Kopf 2005). Extensive recreational fisheries exist throughout the southwest Pacific Ocean (Whitelaw 2001, Bromhead <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2004, Kopf 2005) although total catches by recreational fisheries are very small relative to commercial catches. In addition, a high proportion of Striped Marlin are (tagged and) released by recreational fisheries in the WCPO (up to 60%, Holdsworth <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2003, in Kopf <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2005). However, studies into the survival of recreationally captured marlin have estimated that between 0–50% of marlin suffer post-release mortality due to hook damage, stress or increased susceptibility to predation (Pepperell and Davis 1999), although studies are rare, sample sizes are typically small and the durations of monitoring of post-released fish are relatively short (e.g., maximum of 93 days for Striped Marlin, Domeier <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2003).<br/><br/>Fishing in the tropical eastern Pacific region is by both industrial and artisanal fisheries. Striped Marlin are caught mostly by the longline fisheries of Far East and Western Hemisphere national. Lesser numbers are caught by recreational, gillnet and other fisheries. This species may be threatened by the expansion of long line fisheries and also increased artisanal fisheries in the tropical eastern Pacific region.","McDowell and Graves (2008) indicate that there are four stocks of this species: one centred in Hawaii, one in Australia and New Zealand, and two in the Eastern Tropical Pacific. At present, assessments have been conducted for the Southwest Pacific (Langley <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2006), and for the northeastern Pacific (Hinton and Maunder 2011). Preliminary assessments have been conducted for the entire Pacific (Brodziak and Piner 2010), but a new stock assessment for the northwest Pacific is needed.

The results of the model were considered preliminary, as there remains a great deal of uncertainty regarding some of the key parameters included in the assessment model, in particular natural mortality and growth. Generally, the assessment indicates that current levels of fishing mortality may approximate or exceed FMSY and current biomass levels may approximate or be below BMSY (Langley <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2006).

Over a three generation length period (1992–2008), the population decline was calculated to be 0% as the spawning biomass has been increasing since 2003 (Figure 5.2.3.1, Hinton and Maunder 2011).

It is likely that declines are in the order of 40–50% for the Northwest Pacific (Hinton pers. comm. 2011).

An average of these two declines was used to characterize the population in the Indian Ocean, however these data are limited and catch data from other industrial fisheries such as longliners of Indonesia and Philippines are not available. The stock is not considered to be well managed and more information is needed to understand population declines for Striped Marlin in the Indian Ocean.",Decreasing,"This species is widely distributed in tropical and temperate waters of the Indo-Pacific and strays are occasionally found in the southeastern Atlantic. It is strongly oceanic, and rarely enters coastal waters. It is the most widely distributed of all Pacific billfishes, especially in the eastern and northern Central Pacific, where it is much more abundant than in the Western Pacific.<br/><br/>Historic Japanese longline records indicate that adult Striped Marlin have a somewhat horseshoe shaped distribution in the Pacific Ocean (Nakamura 1985) which is unique among Pacific billfish and tunas. The base of this distribution is centred on the south central American coast, and has extensions which run either side of the equator right across to the Western Pacific Ocean (Nakamura 1985). The central equatorial region in the western and central Pacific is characterized by very low and intermittent hook rate for Striped Marlin, and thus is not considered part of their normal distribution (Ueyanagi and Wares 1975).<br/><br/>According to early longlining data, the areas of highest abundance were in the central north and the eastern Pacific, while the waters of the south and western Pacific were areas of lesser abundance (Ueyanagi and Wares 1975). In the south and southwest Pacific, adults are most abundant during the spring and summer and least abundant in the winter. This region includes eastern Australian, where striped marlin are present from the Coral Sea to Tasmania (depending on currents and seasons).<br/><br/>In the Eastern Pacific the distribution stretches from California to the southwestern and central eastern Gulf of California to Peru, including all of the oceanic islands.",This is an important commercial and recreational species.,Marine,"This is a highly migratory species, listed in Annex I of the 1982 Convention on the Law of the Sea (FAO Fisheries Department 1994).<br/><br/>In the Western Central Pacific, the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission (WCPFC) is tasked to undertake precautionary measures that will not permit increases in fishing mortality until the estimates of stock status are more certain.

It is recommended that there should not be an increase in fishing for this species in the northern population in the Eastern Pacific.<br/><br/>Similarly, the International Scientific Committee for Tuna and Tuna-like species for the North Pacific Ocean (ISC) recommended that fishing mortality for Striped Marlin in the North Pacific not be permitted to exceed current levels.<br/><br/>There are no management measures for Striped Marlin in the Indian Ocean.","",,false,false,Global

Global declines were calculated as a weighted average of the declines for each stock using maximum historical catch as a proxy for the stock's contribution to the global population. Based on the available data, this species is listed as Vulnerable under criterion A2. This species is not considered to be well managed in any part of its range. It is important to note that the Pacific stock comprises over half of the global population for this species, and that declines in the Pacific were estimated using catch data as no recent standardized indices were available. It is likely that declines based on these data are conservative. Fishing effort in the Pacific and Indian Oceans is increasing as a result of longline fisheries operating at deeper depths and in the Atlantic due to expansion of artisanal fleets. There is urgent need for an updated stock assessment for the Pacific Ocean and a reassessment of this species may be warranted when newer information becomes available. Data reporting from the Indian Ocean is also poor. We recommend that appropriate fishery statistics be compiled and analysed to accurately assess the condition of this species.","This epipelagic and oceanic species is mostly confined to the waters on the warmer side of the 24°C surface isotherm and known to undergo seasonal north-south migrations. It is found to 1,000 m depth but spends the highest percentage of its time at shallower depths, and is not usually seen close to land masses or islands, unless there is a deep drop-off of the shelf. This species can dive as deep as 1,000 m, but it remains mostly within the upper 40 m. It is believed to form small-scale schools of at most 10 individuals. Larger fish tend to swim solitarily (Nakamura 1985) but smaller ones form aggregations.<br/><br/>It feeds on squids, tuna-like fishes, crustaceans, and cephalopods (Nakamura 1985). Spawning probably takes place year-round in equatorial waters to 10°N/S and during summer periods in both hemispheres to 30°N/S, in both the Indian and Pacific oceans (Kailola <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 1993). In the southern hemisphere, concentrations of spawning fish probably occur around French Polynesia (Howard and Ueyanagi 1965). In Brazil, spawning occurs February to March from 20–23°S, primarily in the Abrolhos Archipelago (Amorim <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 1998). Most of the individuals captured at this location have been juveniles (Amorim pers. comm. 2010).<br/><br/>Maximum time at large recorded is 11 years (Ortiz <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2003). Maximum age is estimated to be at least 20 years (Wilson <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 1991). Maximum age is estimated in the Pacific as 27 years (females) and 18 years (males) (Hill <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 1989). Age estimation in marlins is problematic and longevity information from the Pacific has also been applied to the Atlantic. Age at maturity is estimated to be two years (Prince <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 1991, Torres-Silva <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2006). Using longevity estimates of 20 years and 27 years, and age of maturity of two years, the generation length was estimated to be between 4.5–6 years. The generation length is calculated as: age of first reproduction + z * (longevity - age of first maturity), where z is 0.15 (Collette <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2011).<br/><br/>The all-tackle game fish record is of a 636-kg fish caught off Vitoria, Brazil in 1992 (IGFA 2011).","In the Pacific, Blue Marlin are an incidental catch of longline fisheries, bycatch in swordfish fisheries, and an important resource for big game recreational fishing. More than 73% of reported landings are incidental to large offshore longline fisheries, and other major fisheries are the directed recreational fisheries of the USA and other countries (Restrepo <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2003). Protections efforts for blue marlin have continued to decrease in recent years, as deeper longline gear is introduced (Uozumi 1999).<br/><br/>In the Atlantic new fleets have harvested large catches of Blue Marlin,  including artisanal fish aggregating devices (FAD) fisheries in the  eastern Caribbean islands and a new artisanal fleet of small longliners  operating off Brazil between 18°S and 30°S. This species is primarily  taken as bycatch by longline fisheries, but also by purse seines, by  some artisanal gears which are the only fisheries targeting marlins and  also by various sport fisheries located on both sides of the Atlantic. The increasing use of anchored FADs by various artisanal and sport  fisheries is causing greater vulnerability of these stocks (STECF 2009).  For example, over the last fifteen years, Antillean artisanal fleets  have increased the use of Moored Fish Aggregating Devices (MFADs) to  capture pelagic fish. Catches of Blue Marlin caught around MFADs are  known to be significant but reports on these catches made to the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT) are  very incomplete (ICCAT 2006).","<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Atlantic Ocean</span><br/>The most recent stock assessment for Blue Marlin (ICCAT 2007) used a Bayesian Surplus Production model to estimate biomass from 1990 through 2006. The remaining data series (1956–1989) are based on biomass estimates from the previous stock assessment (ICCAT 2002). Population declines were examined using a generation length estimated between 4.5 and 6 years. Over a three generation length period of 14 years, the decline was 60% and over a three generation length period of 18 years, the decline was 64%. These declines were calculated using a linear regression over each of the time periods examined. Population reduction for Atlantic blue marlin was therefore estimated to be between 60% and 64%. For all of the models for which the stock productivity was constrained to be near the productivity estimated by the last full assessment, the current biomass was estimated to be at or below biomass at maximum sustainable yield (BMSY) and current fishing mortality rates were above FMSY. The stock is therefore not considered to be well-managed.<br/><br/><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Pacific Ocean</span><br/>The best knowledge currently available indicates that Blue Marlin constitutes a single world-wide species (Buonaccorsi <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 1999, 2001, Collette <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2006), and that there is a single stock of Blue Marlin in the Pacific Ocean (Hinton 2001). No recent estimates of biomass or catch per unit effort (CPUE) were available. Biomass estimates from the last stock assessment for Pacific Blue Marlin (Kleiber <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2003) were available only until 1997. We therefore used estimated catch data from the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission (IATTC) (Hinton, unpublished data 2011), which were the only available recent data. We assume that effort has remained stable or has increased over the time period examined. Based on catch data and a generation length of 4.5–6 years, we estimated declines of 5% over 14 years (1996–2009) and 19% over 18 years (1992–2009) using linear regression. We consider that these estimates of decline (based on catches) are likely conservative. This stock is not considered to be well-managed and there is urgent need for a newer stock assessment to evaluate population trends.<br/><br/><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Indian Ocean</span><br/>Nominal yearly CPUE of Japanese longliners in Northwest Australia has declined 58.9% over a 14 year period (1993–2007) and 70.6% over a 18 year period (1989–2007; Figure 40, IOTC 2009). The CPUE decline for Japanese longliners in the Seychelles was 79.5% over 14 years and 56.9% over 18 years (Figure 40, IOTC 2009). For each time period considered, an average of the declines in Northwest Australia and the Seychelles was used to characterize the population in the Indian Ocean. The decline in the Indian Ocean ranged from 63–69% depending on the time period considered. It is important to note that these data are limited and catch data from other industrial fisheries such as longliners of Indonesia and Philippines are not available. The stock is not considered to be well managed and more information is needed to understand population declines for blue marlin in the Indian Ocean.",Decreasing,"An epipelagic oceanic species, blue marlin is often found in wide open blue waters with surface temperatures between 22° and 31°C. It is the most tropical of the billfishes. Its latitudinal range changes seasonally, expanding northwards and southwards in the warmer months and contracting towards the equator in colder months.<br/><br/>In the Eastern Pacific it is found from California to the southwestern and central eastern Gulf of California to Peru, including all of the oceanic islands. In the Atlantic Ocean, adults are commonly found in the tropics within the 24°C isotherm.<br/><br/>In both the eastern tropical Pacific and the eastern tropical Atlantic, Blue Marlin concentrate in shallower waters than in the western part of both oceans due to hypoxia-based habitat compression over oxygen minimum zones in the eastern tropical seas (Prince <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2010).<br/><br/><p><br/><sup><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_blue_marlin#cite_note-17""><span></a></sup></p>","Blue Marlin occurs as bycatch, primarily in longline fisheries for tuna. There is also a directed recreational catch for this species in many areas. The flesh is of good quality and is marketed frozen and prepared as  sashimi and but most of it is marketed frozen or for sausages in Japan  (Nakamura 1985).",Marine,"This is a highly migratory species, listed under Annex I of the 1982 Convention on the Law of the Sea (FAO Fisheries Department 1994).<br/><br/>In some areas, long-lining is restricted to protect fish stocks for sport fishing. Size limitations, encouragement of catch-and-release sport fishing, and recommendations for using circle hooks instead of J-hooks are measures designed to increase survival in catch-and-release sport fishing (Pine <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2008, Serafy <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2009). Marlin species are a special case because bycatch in the longline fisheries concentrating primarily on tunas causes the majority of fishery mortality (&gt;90%) for marlin (Kitchell <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2004). In the Pacific, marlin are most frequently captured on the shallow hooks of a longline set (those close to the floats), and removing less than 15% of the hook sets adjacent to floats would decrease marlin catch by as much as 50% (Kitchell <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2004).<br/><br/>For Blue Marlin in the Atlantic, the ICCAT Standing Committee on Research and Statistics (ICCAT–SCRS) in 2008 asked the Commission, at a minimum, to continue the management measures already in place because marlins have not yet recovered. The Commission should take steps to assure that the reliability of the recent fishery information improves in order to provide a basis for verifying possible future rebuilding of the stocks. Improvements are needed in the monitoring of the fate and number of dead and live releases, with verification from scientific observer programs; verification of current and historical landings from some artisanal and industrial fleets; and complete and updated relative abundance indices from CPUE data for the major fleets. Should the Commission wish to increase the likelihood of success of the current management measures of the marlin rebuilding plan, further reduction in mortality would be needed, including: implementing plans to improve compliance of current regulations; encouraging the use of alternative gear configurations, including certain types of circle hooks, hook/bait combinations etc., in fisheries where its use has been shown to be beneficial; and broader application of time/area catch restrictions.<br/><br/>Given the recent importance of the catch from artisanal fisheries, and to increase the likelihood of recovery of marlin stocks, the Commission should consider regulations that control or reduce the fishing mortality generated by these fisheries. The Commission should encourage continued research on development of methods to incorporate this information into stock assessments in order to provide a basis for increasing the certainty with which management advice can be provided.<br/><br/>The Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries (STECF) stresses the need for correct identification and reporting of billfish species in all&#160; fisheries. Furthermore, STECF notes that the 2007 ICCAT–SCRS report indicated the potential for the stocks of blue marlin and white marlin to recover to the BMSY level. However, recent increases in catches of Blue Marlin by artisanal fisheries on both sides of the Atlantic may compromise the effectiveness of the ICCAT plan (STECF 2009).<br/><br/>Recent analyses suggest that the recovery of blue marlin stock might proceed faster than would have been estimated at the 2000 assessment, provided catches remain at the level estimated for 2004. Some signs of stabilization in the abundance trend are apparent in the most recent catch per unit of effort data of Blue Marlin (2000–2004) Recommendations [Rec. 00-13], [Rec. 01-10] and finally [Rec. 02-13] placed additional catch restrictions for Blue Marlin and White Marlin. The first established that the annual amount of Blue Marlin that can be harvested by pelagic longline and purse seine vessels and retained for landing must be no more than 33% for White Marlin and 50% for Blue Marlin of the 1996 or 1999 landing levels, whichever is greater. That recommendation established that all Blue Marlin and White Marlin brought to pelagic longline and purse seine vessels alive shall be released in a manner that maximizes their survival. The provision of this paragraph does not apply to marlins that are dead when brought along the side of the vessel and that are not sold or entered into commerce. Catches of both species have declined since 1996–99, the period selected as the reference period by the recommendations. Since 2002, the year of implementation of the last of these two recommendations, the catch of Blue Marlin has been below the 50% value recommended by the Commission. This analysis represents only longline caught marlin even though the recommendations referred to the combined catch of pelagic longline and purse seine because the catch estimates of billfish by-catch from purse seine vessels are more uncertain than those from longline. More countries have started reporting data on live releases in 2006. Additionally, more information has come about, for some fleets, on the potential for using gear modifications to reduce the bycatch and increase the survival of marlins (ICCAT 2007).<br/><br/>Catches of Blue Marlin in the Indian Ocean are very poorly reported and there is need of better data to evaluate the condition of the Indian Ocean stock.","",,false,false,Global

Given that it is caught with the same gear as the Blue Marlin and Striped Marlin, it is likely that the population of this species is declining as well, but there is no data to quantify this.

It feeds on a variety of small schooling fishes, squids, and shrimps (Collette and Nauen, 1983).<br/><br/>Males can mature and spawn at one year of age at a length of approximately 51 cm. Females usually spawn more than once per season beginning at two years of age. However, most are approximately 69 cm long or three years old at first spawning (California Department of Fish and Game 2010). It is not likely to live longer than six years.

Catch landings for this subspecies have greatly fluctuated, and therefore it is difficult to estimate the effect of fishing on its population. It is not clear what is causing these fluctuations. Pacific Bonito populations fluctuate on a decadal scale in a similar manner as the northern anchovy. Current conditions indicate that the eastern Pacific is in a warm water regime that favours Pacific Sardine over Northern Anchovy, which is a primary prey species for Pacific Bonito. It is therefore thought that these fluctuations in both anchovy and Pacific Bonito are associated with warm and cold water periods of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (California Department of Fish and Game 2010).<br/><br/>Commercial landings for this subspecies have declined steadily since the mid 1980s, but have increased moderately in recent years, from 291 metric tons in 1997 to 803 metric tons in 2008. The trend over the last 15 years seems to be low landings for most years interspersed with high yield years. Competition with higher valued fisheries was likely part of the decline observed in landings during the 1980s and 1990s. Additionally, increased regulation, decreased stocks and lower market demand likely contributed to the decline. In 1982, Mexico began restricting foreign vessel access to its near-shore fisheries. Prior to this closure, 50–90% of Pacific Bonito landed in the United States was caught off the coast of Baja California, Mexico. Now less than 10% originates in Mexican waters (California Department of Fish and Game 2010).<br/><br/>FAO reported landings for <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Sarda chiliensis</span> (both subspecies) highly fluctuate and range from 35,016 tonnes reported in 1950 to 11,3161 tonnes in 1961; to 2,383 tonnes reported in 2003 and 6,243 tonnes reported in 2006 (FAO 2009). Landings in California and Mexico have fluctuated greatly over the past 50 years from less than 1,000 metric tons to nearly 14,000 mt in the early 1970s (worth $1,222,000 in total California landings in 1976) (Collette and Nauen 1983). Combined landings of U.S. and Mexico in 1995 was about 6,800 mt, while in the last five years (2000–2005), the landings have been under 500 mt (FAO 2009), representing a decline of over 90%, assuming landings are a good proxy for population trends.<br/><br/>The combined Chilean and Peruvian landings of the southern subspecies, <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Sarda chiliensis chiliensis</span>, went from almost zero in 1,940 mt to a peak of around 110,000 mt in 1961 and dropped off to about 40,000 mt in 1973 (Collette and Nauen, 1983). From 1995–2005 the catch reduction went from around 30,000 mt per year to around 1,000 to 5,000 mt per year (FAO 2009). Reported landings for this species (in Ecuador, Chile and Peru) plunged to between 1,000 and 5,000 mt per year between 1998 and 2005. A conservative estimate is a reduction in catch of around 80% since 1995.<br/><br/>In Peru, however, there was a decrease in effort during the late 1990s which may reflect the decrease in catch at this time. Also drops in catch may be related to reduction in anchovies, but also during this time there was an increase in effort for Jack Mackerel and <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Scomber japonicus</span>. Although the catch is rising again in 2005 and 2006, this is likely due to an increase in fishing effort.<br/><br/>In Chile, less than 10,000 mt in the 1960 and 1970s was estimated to be caught, and this was the period of the highest catches (R. Sierra pers. comm. 2008).

Although the estimated population size is above the thresholds for any of the categories for threat, it is not large (34,000–166,000 adults and sub-adults) and the number of mature individuals is unknown.  The estimated number of spawning females for the Klamath River (which supports most of the northern DPS) is only 760–1,500 per year. However, four out of seven (57%) of the known spawning locations have been lost within the last three generations for reasons, not all of which are clearly understood, and may not have ceased or reversible. <br/> <br/>Green Sturgeon are not subjected to overfishing and habitat fragmentation that have affected other sturgeon species. There are active fisheries restrictions in place throughout the species’ range in the U.S. and Canada. <br/> <br/>The current adult–subadult population size is estimated at least in the tens of thousands and there is no evidence of overall population decline, although four of the seven known spawning locations may have been lost. Considerable research is underway or planned to fill in information gaps on stock structure, abundance and migrations.  Although Green Sturgeon currently does not warrant ""threatened"" status under U.S. Endangered Species Act, concerns remain about the limited number of spawning rivers, potential growth of fisheries, and persistent habitat threats from water withdrawals and agricultural pesticides. Given the species’ life history characteristics and limited number of spawning sites, it is considered likely that the species would quickly move into a threatened category if current conservation efforts were withdrawn. It is therefore assessed as Near Threatened.","The Green Sturgeon is among the most marine oriented and widespread of the sturgeons. Like most sturgeons, the Green Sturgeon is characterized by large size, longevity, delayed maturation, high fecundity, and far-ranging movements. Green Sturgeon reach sizes up to 2.7 m and have been aged to over 50 years (Nakamoto <em>et al</em>. 1995, Farr <em>et al</em>. 2002). Mortality rates of subadults and adults are low and probably do not exceed 10% per year from natural causes based on age frequency analysis.  Males typically mature at about 15–17 years and 1.5–1.8 m, while females typically mature at 20–25 years and 1.8–2.1 m (Van Eenennaam and Doroshov  2001a). Similarly aged males are generally smaller than females with males from the northern DPS achieving a maximum size of 168 cm, while sexually mature males and females from the southern DPS range in size from 139 to199 cm and 157 to 223 cm, respectively (Adams <em>et al</em>. 2002).  Spawning is believed to occur every 3-5 years and the generation time is 27–33 years (Davies 2004).
<br/>
<br/>Green Sturgeon are oviparious broadcast spawners and adult Green Sturgeon typically migrate into freshwater beginning in late February and spawning occurs in April to June in deep, turbulent river mainstems (Moyle <em>et al</em>. 1995). Klamath and Rogue River populations appear to spawn within 160 km of the ocean while the Sacramento population may travel over 320 km upriver. Green Sturgeon eggs and larvae are comparatively larger than those of other sturgeon species. For example, Cech <em>et al</em>. (2000) reported a egg diameter of 4.34, 3.40 and 2.62 mm for green, white, and Atlantic Sturgeon (<em>A. oxyrinchus</em>) respectfully indicating that Green Sturgeon have eggs which have a volume twice that of white and over four times that of Atlantic Sturgeon. Consequently, Green Sturgeon have a relatively lower fecundity in comparison to other similar sized sturgeon species as reproductive energy is more heavily invested in egg size rather than egg number (Van Eenennaam <em>et al</em>. 2001b, Cech <em>et al</em>. 2000). Fecundity varies with age and size, but has been estimated to be in the order of  2,800 eggs per kilogram bodyweight; approximately half that of White Sturgeon (<em>Acipenser transmontanus</em>) at 5,648 eggs per kilogram bodyweight (Moyle 2002).
<br/>
<br/>The eggs do not form a thick jelly coat as do those of other North American sturgeon and exhibit poor adhesion to substrate (Deng 2000, Cech <em>et al</em>. 2000), which would indicate sensitivity to turbidity loading  (Moyle <em>et al</em>. 1994, Moyle 2002). Furthermore, the larger eggs and higher growth rates of developing Green Sturgeon in comparison to other North American sturgeons suggests that a higher oxygen demand may be required for proper embryonic development; thus Green Sturgeon may require colder, cleaner water for spawning. (USFWS 1995).
<br/>
<br/>Eggs hatch in 7 to 9 days at 15°C (Van Eenennaam <em>et al</em>. 2001). Cech <em>et al</em>. (2000) reported that temperatures above 20°C are lethal to embryos and temperatures above 24°C significantly reduce five-day larval growth rates. Larvae begin to feed at 10 days post hatch and complete metamorphosis into juveniles at 45 days (Adams <em>et al</em>. 2002).  Juvenile Green Sturgeon grow rapidly reaching 60 cm within 2–3 years and they spend 1–4 years in fresh and estuarine waters before dispersal to saltwater (Beamsesderfer and Webb 2002). Green Sturgeon are commonly observed in bays and estuaries up and down the coast and large concentrations enter the Columbia River estuary, and Washington's Grays Harbor and Willapa Bay during late summer (Moyle <em>et al</em>. 1995). Limited tagging studies show that tagged individuals from the Columbia River have been recaptured off the west coast of Vancouver Island (Adams <em>et al</em>. 2002).
<br/>
<br/>During the 1 to 4 years of freshwater residence, juveniles gradually move to deeper and more saline areas as they grow (Beamesderfer and Webb 2002). As juveniles grow, they exhibit greater tolerance to salinity and achieve seawater tolerance at seven months or sooner (Allen and Cech 2003). Adults return to freshwater to spawn, and Green Sturgeon have been reported to spawn up to 160 km upstream in the Klamath and Rogue rivers, and over 300 km upstream in the Sacramento River (Beamesderder and Webb 2002). After spawning, they to sea in late autumn to early winter when temperatures drop below 10°C and flows increased above 100 m<sup>3</sup>s<sup>-1</sup> (Erickson <em>et al</em>. 2002).
<br/>
<br/>Juveniles are opportunistic benthic feeders with a diet consisting of various invertebrates and fish (EPIC 2001, Moyle 2002).  Stomach content analysis indicates that adult Green Sturgeon have a marine diet consisting of various benthic invertebrates including shrimp, crabs, worms, amphioids, and isopods (EPIC 2001), but have also been observed feeding on sand lances (<em>Ammodytes hexapterus</em>) and other fish.","Sturgeon exhibit a combination of morphology, life history and habitat requirements that make them highly susceptible to negative impacts from human activities (Boreman 1997).  Anthropogenic activities known to impact sturgeon include: exploitation   blockage of available freshwater spawning habitat through diking, damming causing inadequate flow regimes, channelization, elimination of backwater areas, dewatering of streams, destruction of thermal refugia, loss of deep pools, inundation of habitat by reservoirs, and exposure to bioaccumulating industrial and municipal pollution, (Boreman 1997, EPIC 2001, Adams <em>et al</em>. 2002). <br/> <br/>The long life span and late age of maturity makes sturgeon vulnerable to chronic and acute effects of bioaccumulation. White Sturgeon, for example have been found to have the greatest contaminant concentrations compared to salmonids, suckers, Walleye (<em>Sander vitreus</em>), Pacific Lamprey (<em>Lampetra tridentata</em>), and Eulachon (<em>Thaleichthys pacificus</em>), [USEPA 1999]. Whole body concentrations of hexachlorobenzene (19 ųg/kg), DDT (787 ųg/kg), p,p’DDE (620 ųg/kg), Aroclors (173 ųg/kg), and dioxins were an order of magnitude higher in concentration than all other species tested.  Although Green Sturgeon are less exposed to anthropogenic contaminants due to their marine migratory phase, there is the potential for exposure when entering freshwater to spawn and during estuarine concentrations. <br/> <br/>Marine and estuarine environments in Canada are of concern as they are heavily impacted by a number of activities including logging, aquaculture, agriculture and urbanization, and can be the eventual sinks to freshwater pollutants. However, a 1994 assessment of the quality of the lower Fraser River ecosystem indicated that no dramatic changes in species assemblages were determined to have occurred since the previous study in 1974 (Healey <em>et al</em>. 1994) despite an increase in usage. Area managed for conservation also increased from 23 to 69% over the same time period with 80% of the increase being accounted for by conservation efforts on the Fraser River estuary (MWLAP 2002). The increase in estuary protection and the results from Healey <em>et al</em>. (1994) suggests that estuarine habitat loss that may effect Green Sturgeon is likely not substantial in Canada. <br/> <br/>In the US, where all known spawning populations occur, Green Sturgeon have lost spawning habitat to poor land use practices and habitat alteration through water management projects (EPIC 2001). This has caused a decline in general water quality in some areas through increased sedimentation as well as the loss of deep pools which Green Sturgeon are known to prefer. Furthermore, damming of river systems can block previously available spawning habitat, affect natural flow regimes, potentially reduce areas of thermal refugia, and change sediment transport characteristics of the river which may cascade and impact sturgeon by modifying ecosystem community structure (EPIC 2001). For example, Green Sturgeon were historically observed hundreds of kilometers upstream in the Sacramento and Columbia rivers, but are currently restricted in the Columbia River to the lower 60 km downstream of the Bonneville Dam (Moyle 2002). <br/> <br/>Beamesderfer and Webb (2002 suggest that habitat conditions throughout the Green Sturgeon range have stabilized or are improving, but the results of spawning surveys have yet to substantiate that (NMFS 2002). Most of the northern population segment spawns in the Klamath River. Potential threats to this population include concentration of spawning, harvest (especially in mixed-stock estuarine fisheries), and loss of spawning habitat such as the Columbia River, and the Eel and South Fork, and Trinity Rrivers in California (Adams <em>et al</em>. 2002). <br/> <br/>The southern population segment (south of the Eel River) is more of a concern because it has fewer spawners (limited to the Sacramento-San Joaquin system), which makes it more susceptible to catastrophic events. These fish also face potentially lethal temperature limits, entrainment by water projects, and may be adversely affected by pesticides and other toxic substances and exotic species (Adams <em>et al</em>. 2002). It is probable that Green Sturgeon spawning habitat has been lost behind dams and water diversions throughout the Central Valley (e.g., Red Bluff Diversion Dam and Glenn-Colusa Irrigation District pumping plant). <br/> <br/><strong>Utilisation</strong> <br/>Green Sturgeon harvest is all bycatch in Green Sturgeon harvest is all bycatch in two three fisheries. The smaller bycatch occurs in Klamath River Tribal salmon gill net fisheries while the larger portion is in the White Sturgeon commercial and sport fisheries (Adams <em>et al</em>. 2002). Total annual harvest of Green Sturgeon declined substantially to 1,192 fish in 1999–2001 from 6,871 fish in 1985–1989. Most of this earlier harvest came from the Columbia River (51%) and Washington coastal fisheries (28%). In recent years, Columbia and Washington coastal harvest was substantially reduced and in 2001 these two bycatch fisheries and that of the Klamath River tribes were about equal in number. Catch reduction in the Columbia River is a result of increasingly restrictive regulations. For the sturgeon sport fishery, slot limits prohibit retention of fish (white or green) less than 107 cm (42 inches) or more than 152 cm (60 inches). Green Sturgeon retained as bycatch in the commercial fishery must be between 122 and 168 cm (48-66 inches). <br/> <br/>Klamath Tribal fisheries (Yurok and Hoopa) accounted for an average 266 adult fish annually from 1986–2001 with no apparent trend. This fishery is monitored but not regulated. California sport catch of Green Sturgeon, primarily in San Pablo Bay, is not monitored, but is thought to be only a few fish each year (Adams <em>et al</em>. 2002). California slot size limits for both sturgeon species is 117–183 cm (46–72 inches). <br/> <br/>There is also a bycatch in the domestic trawl fishing industry in B.C., which takes about 171 Green Sturgeon annually (Davis 2004). <br/> <br/>There is no information on the extent of illegal exploitation of Green Sturgeon, but poaching activity on White Sturgeon in the lower Fraser River is a concern (Ptolemy and Vennesland 2003).","Preliminary population genetics results suggest that Green Sturgeon from the Klamath and Rogue rivers are similar to each other but distinct from fish from San Pablo Bay. Green Sturgeon commonly occur in the lower Columbia River (Oregon–Washington) and genetic samples taken there appear to be a mixture of the other populations (Israel <em>et al</em>. 2002).
<br/>
<br/>The National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS 2003) has determined that, based on genetic evidence of discreteness, there are two Distinct Population Segments (DPS's) for Green Sturgeon. The northern population ranges from the Eel River, California, to at least the Rogue River, Oregon. The southern population is principally comprised of the Sacramento River spawning stock.
<br/>
<br/>Their wide distribution, large numbers observed seasonally in some areas, and projections based on demographic rates suggest that total Green Sturgeon numbers are at least in the tens of thousands (Beamesderfer and Webb 2002). The largest known spawning stock of Green Sturgeon is that of the Klamath River and its tributary, the Trinity River. The Klamath River population is estimated to number up to 66,000 individuals of which 3,000 would be mature adults. Actual spawner numbers in the Klamath were estimated at 760–1,500 females per year based on average harvest and total mortality rates (Beamesderfer and Webb 2002).
<br/>
<br/>Based on a review of recent tagging studies, harvest analyses, and stock assessments from many locations, Beamesderfer and Webb (2002) estimated that the total adult and subadult population size of Green Sturgeon is within the range of 34,000 to 160,000 fish. Of these, greatest abundance was recorded for the Columbia River estuary, and ocean and bay waters of Oregon and Washington.
<br/>
<br/>Attempts to determine trends in sturgeon abundance in the northern DPS have been inconclusive regarding the status of Green Sturgeon, and the status of the northern Green Sturgeon population is unknown (NMFS 2002, Davies 2004).
<br/>
<br/>Similar attempts to determine the status of Green Sturgeon in the southern DPS were also inconclusive, and with the exception of anecdotal evidence of a reduction of Green Sturgeon entrainment at water export facilities indicative of a population decline, the status of the southern DPS is also unknown (NMFS 2002, Davies 2004).",Stable,"Green Sturgeon is an anadromous species that spend most of their life in near-shore marine and estuarine waters from Mexico to southeast Alaska (Houston 1988, Moyle <em>et al</em>. 1995, Davies 2004).
<br/>
<br/>Large concentrations of Green Sturgeon are still found in coastal estuaries, but their range in freshwater has been restricted by damming in some rivers. For example, Green Sturgeon were historically observed hundreds of kilometers upstream in the Sacramento and Columbia rivers, but are currently restricted in the Columbia River to the lower 60 km downstream of the Bonneville Dam (Moyle 2002). Spawning is presently known to occur in only three rivers in North America, all of which are in the United States: the Rogue River in Oregon (Erickson <em>et al</em>. 2001, Rien <em>et al</em>. 2001), and the Klamath and Sacramento river systems in California (EPIC 2001, Adams <em>et al</em>. 2002, CDFG 2002, Moyle <em>et al</em>. 1992,1994).  Spawning populations have been extirpated from the San Joaquin, Eel, South Fork, and Trinity rivers, and possibly the Umpqua River (EPIC 2001, NMFS 2002). Seasonal concentrations occur in several estuaries including the Sacramento-San Joaquin, Eel, Columbia, Willapa Bay, Grays Harbor and the Fraser River (Beamesderfer and Webb 2002).",,Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,"Fishery managers in California, Oregon, Washington and British Columbia have recognized the sensitivity of Green Sturgeon to fishing and have actively restricted commercial and sport fisheries everywhere Green Sturgeon occur. None of the reviews examined mentioned any legal, regional, national or international trade in Green Sturgeon products. This species is not considered as good to eat as White Sturgeon and markets for their flesh are limited. <br/> <br/>Due to life history characteristics that make it particularly sensitive to human activities or natural events Green Sturgeon has a designation of ""Special Concern"" in Canada (Houston 1988, Davies 2004), and no harvest is allowed in Canadian waters. <br/> <br/>In response to a petition to list Green Sturgeon under the U.S. Endangered Species Act, the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) completed a status review for this species (Adams <em>et al</em>. 2002). NMFS determined that the species is comprised of two distinct population segments (DPS) but that neither warrants listing as a threatened or endangered species at this time (NMFS 2003). However, because of remaining uncertainties about their population structure and status, both DPS populations were added to the agency's list of candidate species and will be reevaluated in five years provided sufficient new information becomes available.<br/><br/>It is listed on CITES Appendix II.",Nearctic|Neotropical,,false,false,Global

A re-examination of all the data available for this species has resulted in it being downgraded to Least Concern. <br/> <br/>Some subpopulations of white sturgeon are of conservation concern: <br/> <br/>1. A recent analysis using a population dynamics model for the Nechako River subpopulation has indicated more than 50% probability of extinction in the wild within the next 20–30 years if the current decline rates continue. The subpopulation is Critically Endangered. <br/> <br/>2. The subpopulation from the upper Columbia River is showing major signs of recruitment failure. It is assessed as Critically Endangered. <br/> <br/>3. The Kootenai River subpopulation has been in general decline since the mid-1960's and the remaining wild subpopulation is comprised primarily of adult sturgeon older than 25 years, with very little recruitment observed in the wild since the mid-1970's. It is currently assessed as Endangered. <br/> <br/>4. The Upper Fraser River subpopulation has a restricted range and is estimated to have no more than 250 mature adults remaining. The subpopulation is Endangered. <br/> <br/>5. The Fraser regional subpopulation has declined substantially since the 1980s and is assessed as Vulnerable. <br/> <br/>However, the majority of the global population occurs along the west coast of the United States, occurring in several river systems and rearing primarily within the Sacramento-San Joaquin and Columbia-Snake River basins. Within this range, white sturgeon subpopulations enjoy relatively large, albeit fluctuating, adult populations and in some areas, substantial and sustainable recreational and commercial fisheries. Although some impounded reaches show relatively low recruitment and productivity (along with limited unidirectional gene flow), in general this regional population of white sturgeon is still widespread and abundant. The species is considered Least Concern (LC) at this time.","Generally anadromous, but some subpopulations are landlocked and spend their entire life cycle in freshwater. <em>Acipenser transmontanus</em> is the largest freshwater fish species in North America. The largest white sturgeon on record weighed approximately 682 kg and was taken from the Snake River, Idaho in 1898. Individuals from landlocked subpopulations tend to be smaller.","<strong>Sacramento-San Joaquin River subpopulations</strong> <br/>In California, white sturgeon reside mainly within the Sacramento River and its combined estuary with the San Joaquin River. Historical spawning habitat has been lost primarily due to dam construction and water diversions. In the Sacramento River, white sturgeon previously spawned upstream of Shasta Dam prior to its construction in the 1940s. It is also believed the San Joaquin River may have supported white sturgeon spawning prior to the development and implementation of large water diversions for agriculture (Moyle 1976). Results from a recent white sturgeon spawning habitat study reveal that most spawning occurs in a 55 river mile reach of the Sacramento River from Knights Landing to upstream of Colusa (Schaffter 1997). <br/> <br/><strong>Columbia and Snake River subpopulations</strong> <br/>Historically, white sturgeon were abundant in the unimpounded Columbia River (Oregon and Washington) and in the late 1800's supported an intense commercial fishery (DeVore <em>et al</em>. 1993). Intensive sturgeon fishing began in 1889 and peaked in 1892 with about 2,700,000 kg of sturgeon landed. The stock was depleted by 1899 after a ten year period of excessive harvest (Craig and Hacker 1940).  Season, gear and minimum size restrictions failed to restore the population. Only after maximum size regulations designed to protect sexually mature sturgeon were enacted in 1950 did white sturgeon rebound in the Columbia River. <br/> <br/>Hydroelectric development within the Columbia River basin beginning in 1933 began to isolate white sturgeon above dams. Today there are 17 landlocked subpopulations upstream of Bonneville Dam (the furthest downstream dam in the Columbia River) including the tributary Snake River (DeVore <em>et al</em>. 1993). Productivity appears to vary among the landlocked subpopulations as some support high populations and sustainable fisheries (DeVore <em>et al</em>. 1999b, North <em>et al</em>. 1999) while others sustain no exploitation due to low recruitment and productivity (PSMFC 1992). <br/> <br/><strong>Upper Columbia River subpopulation</strong> <br/>Extensive study has confirmed spawning by upper Columbia white sturgeon at two locations. The vast majority of spawning occurs at the Pend d'Oreille-Columbia confluence (Waneta tailrace) area near the Canada-U.S. border (e.g., RL&amp;L 1995). Spawning at this site has occurred annually since 1993 - the first year spawning studies were initiated. In 1999, a second spawning area was documented in the upper Columbia River just upstream from Arrow Lakes Reservoir (RL&amp;L 2000). Spawning did not occur at this site in 2000. <br/> <br/>Despite the regularity of spawning events, age structure analyses show that recruitment began to decline in 1969, and has failed entirely since 1985 (RL&amp;L 1995). Changes in length-frequency distribution follow a similar pattern, with a dramatic reduction in representation by smaller fish in ongoing sampling programs (RL&amp;L 1996a, BC Ministry of Water, Land and Air Protection, data on file). Sampling in Lake Roosevelt in Washington State, although less intensive, shows a similar recruitment failure (DeVore <em>et al</em>. 1999, Spokane Tribe, data on file). Thus, recruitment of upper Columbia white sturgeon has failed completely, to the point where continued existence of the subpopulation is at risk. <br/> <br/><strong>Kootenai River subpopulation</strong> <br/>For more than the last 100 years, human development has modified the natural hydrograph of the Kootenai River through such activities as Libby dam construction and operation, dyke construction and lowered Kootenai Lake levels. These activities have altered white sturgeon spawning, egg incubation, nursery and rearing habitats, and reduced overall biological productivity.  Although these factors may have contributed to a general lack of recruitment of this unique population of white sturgeon during the last century, the operation of Libby Dam in 1974 is considered to be a primary reason for the population’s continued decline (Apperson and Anders 1991). When Libby Dam began regulating the Kootenai River, average spring peak flows were reduced by more than 50% and winter flows increased by more than 300%. <br/> <br/><strong>Fraser River and Nechako River subpopulations</strong> <br/>Area of occupancy has no doubt been reduced in the lower mainstem due to the alienation of side channels from dyking activity, the infolding of sloughs and wetlands, development and industrial activity. The loss of sloughs, side channels and other low velocity backwater areas has decreased available juvenile rearing habitat. Loss of side channels may reduce spawning habitat availability as well. In the Nechako, flow reduction has reduced depth and the amount of habitat available in side channels and backwaters.","<strong>Sacramento-San Joaquin River subpopulations</strong> <br/>The California Department of Fish and Game periodically monitors the status of white sturgeon in the Sacramento-San Joaquin River system to estimate abundance and mortality rates. The most recent survey completed in 1997 estimated nearly 140,000 white sturgeon (&gt; 40 inches) in the Sacramento River (Shaffter and Kohlhorst 1999). The number of adult white sturgeon fluctuates annually and is largely the result highly variable year classes affecting adult recruitment. For example, strong year classes from the early 1980s recruited large numbers of adult white sturgeon to the fishery beginning around 1994; conversely subsequent severe drought conditions across California from 1987 to 1992 are expected to affect the size of the adult white sturgeon population since reproduction was generally poor during those years (Schaffter and Kohlhorst 1999). As recruitment basically ceases and growth and general mortality reduce the number of legal-sized fish, the adult population should decline the next few years. However, the subsequent series of wet years beginning in 1993 should contribute to another cycle of strong recruitment producing fish that will enter the fishery late in the next decade. The California Department of Fish and Game believes the current low exploitation rates, the ability for white sturgeon to successfully reproduce and recover rapidly from reduced adult populations during wet cycles, and fishing size limits that protect the most productive (i.e., fecund) female white sturgeon suggest that current fishing regulations are adequate to conserve white sturgeon in the Sacramento-San Joaquin River basin. <br/> <br/><strong>Columbia-Snake River subpopulations</strong> <br/>Today, the white sturgeon population residing in the lower, free-flowing reach of the Columbia River is considered the most productive in the species’ range (Devore <em>et al</em>. 1999a). The recreational and commercial harvest in the lower Columbia river has recently averaged over 42,000 annually through 1997. Estimated abundance for legal-sized (42-60 inches) white sturgeon in the lower Columbia River in 1997 was nearly 157,000 fish, a decline from the estimated 227,700 fish in 1995. It appears that the decline was primarily a result of a decrease in the recruitment to the legal-sized population and emigration from the Columbia River system, and not over-harvest. <br/> <br/>Upstream in the first three impounded reaches of the Columbia River the estimated abundance of white sturgeon in 1997 increased from a general population crash in the mid 1980's (North <em>et al</em>. 1999). Generally, white sturgeon increased in all size classes sampled. Researchers suspect that more restrictive harvest guidelines along with some relatively strong year classes in recent years are contributing to increasing populations in recent years. These landlocked populations continue to sustain limited harvest and consumption fisheries. <br/> <br/>Historically within the Snake River, white sturgeon could range from its confluence with the Columbia River upstream nearly 615 river miles to Shoshone Falls, a natural barrier for sturgeon. Twelve dams were constructed along the Snake River between 1901 and 1975 that fragmented white sturgeon populations from the confluence to Shoshone Falls. The abundance of land-locked white sturgeon in the Snake River varies considerably from river reaches with reproducing populations to other reaches containing few individuals and no detectable recruitment. Reaches with reproducing populations currently provide catch and release sport fisheries only. <br/> <br/><strong>Upper Columbia River subpopulation</strong> <br/>The abundance of white sturgeon from the Columbia River mainstem between Keenleyside Dam and the Canada-U.S. border was most recently assessed in 1995, when a population of 1,120 individuals (95% CI = 980 to 1,300) was estimated (RL&L 1996a). This figure does not include sampling in Lake Roosevelt in Washington State, and thus represents a minimum estimate of the total subpopulation. A smaller group of white sturgeon, considered part of the same subpopulation, has been identified at the upper end of Arrow Lakes Reservoir, located upstream from Keenleyside Dam. Estimates place the size of this group at 38 individuals (95% CI = 23 to 78) based on the results of 2000 studies (RL&L 2001). <br/> <br/><strong>Kootenai River subpopulation</strong> <br/>The Kootenai River subpopulation has been in general decline since the mid-1960's (Apperson and Anders 1991, Duke <em>et al</em>. 1999). The remaining wild population is comprised primarily of adult sturgeon older than 25 years, with very little recruitment observed in the wild population since the mid-1970's (Duke <em>et al</em>. 1999, Ireland <em>et al</em>. 2000). In 1997, there were an estimated 1,468 adults (95% CI: 740 to 2,197) and 17 juvenile white sturgeon (Paragamian <em>et al</em>. 1997). <br/> <br/><strong>Fraser River and Nechako River subpopulations</strong> <br/>Mark recapture estimates for subpopulations in the Nechako and lower Fraser Rivers (R.L. & L Environmental Services Ltd. 2000), plus the preliminary estimate from work being done by the Lheidli T’enneh First Nation (Yarmish and Toth 2001) for subpopulation in the Upper Fraser River show the following population sizes: <br/> <br/>Fraser Regional subpopulation:  22,000 (95% CI = 9,800–70,700) <br/>Upper Fraser subpopulation: 255 (95% CI = 158–352)  <br/>Nechako River subpopulation: 571 (95% CI = 421–890) <br/> <br/>The preliminary population estimate for the Upper Fraser River may be skewed by the high recapture rate of individuals found in known areas of congregation. The fish tend to congregate in areas of preferred habitat but can also be found at very low densities in other areas of the mainstem. However, after extensive sampling, investigators do not believe the population can be larger than a few hundred individuals &gt;50 cm in length (Yarmish, pers. comm).",Stable,"The largest component of the white sturgeon population occurs along the west coast of the United States and comprises subpopulations occurring in several river systems and rearing primarily within the Sacramento-San Joaquin and Columbia-Snake River basins. The species is also found in the Kootenai River (United States and Canada), the Fraser River drainage (Canada), and the Columbia River between Hugh Keenleyside Dam and the Canada-U.S. border. <br/> <br/>There is evidence of emigration from the Sacramento and Columbia river systems based on out-of-system tag studies (PSMFC 1992). These included Chadwick (1959) who cited the recovery of a fish tagged in San Pablo Bay in 1954 and recovered in the Columbia River, and Kohlhorst <em>et al</em>. (1991) who noted that 11 white sturgeon tagged in San Pablo Bay (Sacramento River system) were caught in six river systems north of California, primarily the Umpqua River, Oregon (five tags recovered) and the Chehalis River, Washington (three tags). Also in this study, one tag return each was received from the Columbia River, Yaquina River and Tillamook Bay, Oregon and the Willapa River, Washington. More recently a fish originally tagged in the lower Columbia River was re-captured in the Sacramento River in 1997 (DeVore <em>et al</em>. 1999a). Population estimates of legal-sized and adult white sturgeon can vary dramatically (DeVore <em>et al</em>. 1999a, Schaffter and Kohlhorst 1999) but for the most part, this stock is generally believed to be healthy and stable. <br/> <br/>The upper Columbia River white sturgeon subpopulation inhabits the Columbia River mainstem upstream from Grand Coulee Dam. In this area, the largest documented group of the species resides in the area between Hugh Keenleyside Dam and the Canada-U.S. border. Other remnant subpopulations occur, or are suspected, throughout the remainder of the drainage. <br/> <br/>White sturgeon are found in the Fraser River mainstem from the estuary upstream at least as far as the Torpy River, a distance of over 1,000 km (R.L.&amp;L. Environmental Services Ltd. 2000). They are also found in a major tributary of the Fraser, the Nechako River and it’s tributary the Stuart River (these two have a combined stream length of about 400 km). However, sturgeon are not evenly dispersed throughout this length of river, but are clustered in suitable habitat.The Kootenai River subpopulation inhabits and migrates freely in the Kootenai River from Kootenai Falls in Montana (United States) downstream into Kootenay Lake, British Columbia (Canada). It is restricted to approximately 270 km of the Kootenai River and Kootenay Lake.",,Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,"<strong>Kootenai River subpopulation</strong> <br/>The Kootenai River population of white sturgeon was listed as endangered under the Endangered Species Act on September 6, 1994 by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.

The team completed a final recovery plan for the Kootenai River white sturgeon in 1998 which was subsequently approved by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in late 1999 (Duke <em>et al</em>. 1999). The recovery plan describes a series of 46 specific conservation measures in the United States and Canada that are believed necessary to recover the endangered white sturgeon. Recovery objectives are to re-establish successful reproduction in the wild by increasing Kootenai River flows and producing hatchery-reared juveniles over the next 10 years to prevent extinction.<br/><br/>The species is listed on CITES Appendix II.",Nearctic,,false,false,Global
14871490,22823,Ursus maritimus,Vulnerable,A3c,2015,2015-08-27 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"Loss of Arctic sea ice due to climate change is the most serious threat to Polar Bears throughout their circumpolar range (Obbard <em>et al</em>. 2010, Stirling and Derocher 2012, USFWS 2015). We performed a data-based sensitivity analysis with respect to this threat by evaluating the potential response of the global Polar Bear population to projected sea-ice conditions. Our analyses included a comprehensive assessment of generation length (GL) for Polar Bears; development of a standardized sea-ice metric representing important habitat characteristics for the species; and population projections, over three Polar Bear generations, using computer simulation and statistical models representing alternative relationships between sea ice and Polar Bear abundance.<br/><br/>Our analyses highlight the potential for large reductions in the global Polar Bear population if sea-ice loss continues, which is forecast by climate models and other studies (IPCC 2013). Our analyses also highlight the large amount of uncertainty in statistical projections of Polar Bear abundance and the sensitivity of projections to plausible alternative assumptions. Across six scenarios that projected polar bear abundance three generations forward in time using the median and 95th percentile of estimated GL, the median probability of a reduction in the mean global population size greater than 30% was approximately 0.71 (range 0.20-0.95; see Table 4 in the attached Supporting Material). The median probability of a reduction greater than 50% was approximately 0.07 (range 0-0.35), and the probability of a reduction greater than 80% was negligible. The International Union for the Conservation of Nature Red List Guidelines suggests that assessors consider nearly the full range of uncertainty in potential outcomes, and adopt a precautionary but realistic attitude toward risk tolerance (Section 3.2.3, IUCN 2014). In light of the significant probability, across scenarios, of a reduction in mean global population size greater than 30%, and the relatively low probability of a reduction greater than 50%, we conclude that Polar Bears currently warrant listing as Vulnerable under criterion A3c (IUCN 2014).","Polar Bears occur at low densities throughout the circumpolar Arctic and are more abundant in shallower, ice-covered waters associated with the continental shelf where currents or upwellings increase biological productivity. Seasonally, in the summer open water season, Polar Bears may be found on land in higher densities.<br/><br/>The Polar Bear is a K-selected species with late sexual maturity, small litter size, high maternal investment and high adult survival. The Polar Bear’s reproductive rate is among the lowest in all mammals (Bunnell and Tait 1981) although similar to that of other ursids. Females generally mature at 4-5 years, and enter a prolonged oestrus between late March and early June, although most mating occurs in April and early May. Ovulation is induced by mating (Stirling 2009), and implantation is delayed until autumn. The total gestation period ranges between 195-265 days (Uspenski 1977, Amstrup 2003). Whether or not the embryo implants and proceeds to develop is likely determined by body condition. Pregnant females enter dens in snow drifts or slopes on land, close to the sea (Andersen <em>et al</em>. 2012), or on sea ice (in the Chukchi and Beaufort seas) as early as September/October, but more typically in late autumn (Lentfer and Hensel 1980, Amstrup and Gardner 1994, Wiig 1998). Females give birth inside the den, usually in late December to early January (Derocher <em>et al</em>. 1992, Amstrup 2003). Polar Bears most often give birth to twin cubs; singleton and triplet litters are less frequent. Newborn Polar Bears are blind, sparsely haired and weigh approximately 0.6 kg (Blix and Lentfer 1979). They grow rapidly, fed on rich milk from their mother (36% fat; Derocher <em>et al</em>. 1993), and when they emerge from the den sometime between early March and late April (Pedersen 1945, Wiig 1998), they weigh 10-12 kg (Amstrup 2003). In some regions, after emerging from the den, the female may not have fed for a period up to 8 months, which may be the longest period of food deprivation for any mammal (Watts and Hansen 1987).<br/><br/>Cub mortality is high in the first year (Larsen 1985, Amstrup and Durner 1995, Wiig 1998), with the probability of cub survival largely determined by maternal condition. Mothers with larger fat stores in the fall emerge in the spring with larger cubs which are more likely to survive (Atkinson and Ramsay 1995, Derocher and Stirling 1998, Robbins <em>et al</em>. 2012a). The young usually stay with their mother for two years (Lønø 1970, Stirling et al. 1976, Amstrup and Durner 1995, Wiig 1998), and consequently females on average do not enter a new reproductive cycle more often than every third year most places (Amstrup 2003). In contrast to their low reproductive rates, adult Polar Bears have high survival rates (Obbard <em>et al</em>. 2010).<br/><br/>Polar Bears are the most carnivorous of the extant species of bears. Throughout their range, Ringed Seals (<em>Phoca hispida</em>), preferably young-of-the-year, and to a lesser extent Bearded Seals (<em>Erignathus barbatus</em>) are their primary prey (Derocher <em>et al</em>. 2002, Thiemann <em>et al</em>. 2008). In some areas they are also known to take Harp Seals (<em>Pagophilus groenlandicus</em>), Hooded Seals (<em>Cystophora cristata</em>), and even larger species such as Walrus (<em>Odobenus rosmarus</em>) and Beluga (<em>Delphinapterus leucas</em>) (Thiemann <em>et al</em>. 2008). Polar Bears digest fat more efficiently than protein (Best 1984). Polar Bears are large when compared to other ursid species, which is a consequence of their energy-rich diet. Although birds, fish, vegetation and kelp are eaten where locally available during the ice free-season (Pedersen 1945, Russell 1975, Dyck and Romberg 2007, Born <em>et al</em>. 2011, Gormezano and Rockwell 2013), it is unlikely that Polar Bears would be capable of gaining enough nutritional benefit to survive on a primarily terrestrial diet (Ramsay and Hobson 1991, Hobson <em>et al</em>. 2009, Rode <em>et al</em>. 2010b, Rode <em>et al</em>. 2015).","Anthropogenic and natural changes in Arctic environments, as well as recognition of the shortcomings of our knowledge of Polar Bear ecology, are increasing the challenges for Polar Bear conservation and management. Higher ambient temperatures and erratic weather fluctuations, symptoms of anthropogenic climate change, are increasing across the range of polar bears. Polar Bears are dependent upon Arctic sea ice for access to their prey. Their dependence on an ephemeral habitat that exists as a function of sea surface and atmospheric temperatures means that climate warming poses the single most important threat to the long-term persistence of Polar Bears (Obbard <em>et al</em>. 2010). Arctic sea ice loss has thus far progressed faster than most climate models have predicted (Stroeve <em>et al</em>. 2007) with September sea extent declining at a linear rate of 14% per decade from 1979 through 2011 (Stroeve <em>et al</em>. 2012, Stroeve <em>et al</em>. 2014). Because changes in sea-ice are known to alter Polar Bear abundance, productivity, body condition, and distribution (Stirling <em>et al</em>. 1999, Fischbach <em>et al</em>. 2007, Schleibe <em>et al</em>. 2008, Durner <em>et al</em>. 2009, Regehr <em>et al</em>. 2010, Rode <em>et al</em>. 2010a, 2012, 2014b, Bromaghin <em>et al</em>. 2015), continued climate warming will increase future uncertainty and pose severe risks to the welfare of Polar Bear subpopulations (Stirling and Derocher 2012, Derocher <em>et al</em>. 2013). Arctic sea ice extent is linearly related to global mean temperature, which in turn, is directly related to atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations (Amstrup <em>et al</em>. 2010). Population and habitat models predict substantial declines in the distribution and abundance of Polar Bears in the future (Durner <em>et al</em>. 2009, Amstrup <em>et al</em>. 2008, Hunter <em>et al</em>. 2010, Castro de la Guardia <em>et al</em>. 2013, Hamilton et al. 2014). Although Polar Bears living in historically colder regions of the Arctic might derive transient benefit from a climate-driven transition away from multi-year ice (Derocher <em>et al</em>. 2004), the annual sea ice must persist long enough for Polar Bears to derive benefit from associated changes in seal availability and biological productivity. Recent sea ice simulations suggest large regions of the Canadian Arctic Archipelago will be ice free for &gt;5 months by the late 21<sup>st</sup> century (Hamilton <em>et al</em>. 2014). In other parts of the Arctic, the 5-month ice-free threshold may be reached by the middle of the 21<sup>st</sup> century (Atwood <em>et al</em>. 2015). These studies are based on sea-ice data obtained from the World Climate Research Programme's Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5 (CMIP5) (<a href=""http://cmip-pcmdi.llnl.gov/cmip5/"">http://cmip-pcmdi.llnl.gov/cmip5/</a>). An annual ice-free period of ≥5 months is likely to lead to extended fasting, which is predicted to lead to increased reproductive failure and starvation (Molnár <em>et al</em>. 2011, 2014a, Robbins <em>et al</em>. 2012b). Nevertheless, uncertainty and regional variability in the near-term effects of climate change must be included in Polar Bear management and conservation plans.<br/><br/>Although there have been local and regional studies on polar bear denning habitat (Kolenosky and Prevett 1983, Messier <em>et al</em>. 1994, Lunn <em>et al</em>. 2004, Richardson <em>et al</em>. 2005, Durner <em>et al</em>. 2003, 2006, 2013, Andersen <em>et al</em>. 2012), large scale mapping of Polar Bear denning habitat across the Arctic has not occurred. It is also unknown how climate change will change denning locations and habitats, though predicted increases in forest fires may have adverse effects on maternity denning habitat in sub-Arctic regions (Richardson <em>et al</em>. 2007). Declining sea ice availability can impair the ability of pregnant females to reach traditional denning areas (Derocher <em>et al</em>. 2011, Cherry <em>et al</em>. 2013) and increases of rain events will be detrimental for denning Polar Bears (Stirling and Derocher 1993, Derocher <em>et al</em>. 2004).<br/><br/>The occurrence of diseases and parasites in Polar Bears is rare compared with occurrences in other ursids. However, with warming Arctic temperatures, altered climate could influence&#160; infectious disease epidemiology through mechanisms such as novel pathogen introduction due to range expansion of carrier animals and arthropod vectors; modification of host susceptibility; changes in pathogen evolution, transmission, and number of generations per year; host immunosuppression; shifts in main food sources; altered behaviour; and co-infections with multiple agents (Harvell <em>et al</em>. 2002, Parmesan 2006, Burek <em>et al</em>. 2008, Hueffer <em>et al</em>. 2011). As a result, the potential for exposure to pathogens and resulting disease outbreaks may become more significant threats as Polar Bears experience the cumulative effects of multiple stressors (Patyk <em>et al</em>. 2015).<br/><br/>The warming climate has been associated with an increase in pathogens in other Arctic marine and terrestrial organisms. Parasitic agents that have developmental stages outside the bodies of warm-blooded hosts (e.g., nematodes: Laaksonen <em>et al</em>. 2010) will likely benefit from the warmer and wetter weather projected for the Arctic. Improved conditions for such parasites have already adversely affected the health of some Arctic mammals (Kutz <em>et al</em>. 2013). Bacterial parasites also are likely to benefit from a warmer and wetter Arctic (e.g., <em>Vibrio parahaemolyticu</em>s; Baker-Austin <em>et al</em>. 2012). As the effects of climate change become more prevalent, there is concern about the emergence of new pathogens within polar bear range, new threats from existing pathogens that may be able to infect immuno-compromised/stressed bears, and the potential for new and existing pathogens to cross human–animal boundaries (e.g., giardia). Because of the previous limited exposure of Polar Bears to diseases and parasites (Fagre <em>et al</em>. 2015), researchers have as yet been unable to determine whether they will be more susceptible to new pathogens. However, concern is exacerbated by the fact that Polar Bears appear to have a naïve immune system (Weber <em>et al</em>. 2013), which may make them particularly vulnerable to infection. Many different pathogens have been found in seal species that are Polar Bear prey; the potential therefore exists for transmission of these diseases to Polar Bears (Kirk <em>et al</em>. 2010). If Polar Bears become nutritionally stressed, altered foraging behaviours such as increased feeding on the internal organs of their primary prey and use of alternative foods (e.g., Prop et al. 2015) may increase the potential for exposure to pathogens. Ensuring the long-term persistence of Polar Bears will necessitate understanding how a rapidly changing physical environment modulates exposure to disease risk factors and, ultimately, population health.<br/><br/>Persistent organic pollutants, which reach Arctic regions via long range transport by air and ocean currents as well as river run off, also increase uncertainty for the welfare of polar bears (Obbard <em>et al</em>. 2010, <a href=""www.pbsg.npolar.no"">www.pbsg.npolar.no</a>). Although Polar Bears live in relatively pristine Arctic regions, a variety of industrial toxic substances are brought into Polar Bear management areas from human anthropogenic activities around the world. Polar Bears are apex predators and are therefore exposed to high levels of pollutants, which magnify with each step in the food web resulting in high concentrations in polar bear tissue (Letcher <em>et al</em>. 2010). A key characteristic of these pollutants is that they persist in the environment due to low biotic and abiotic degradation. The contaminant burdens among Polar Bears are known to vary among regions (e.g., Letcher <em>et al</em>. 2010, McKinney <em>et al</em>. 2011). Even where contaminant burdens may be known, their effects on Polar Bear physiol­ogy and health are not well understood (Letcher <em>et al</em>. 2010, Sonne <em>et al</em>. 2012). However, Dietz <em>et al</em>. (2015) showed that the risk for reproductive, immune suppressive and carcinogenic effects in polar bear subpopulations across the Arctic are high due to PCB and perflourinated compounds (PFCs) exposure.<br/><br/>Many of the contaminants are lipophilic and bond tightly to lipophilic tissues. Polar Bears are particularly vulnerable to organochlorines because they eat a fat rich diet. Ringed, bearded, and harp seals comprise the main food of Polar Bears and the blubber layer is preferentially eaten by the bears and subsequently, the intake of pollutants is high (Letcher <em>et al</em>. 2010). Recent studies have documented new pollutants in polar bear tissues which expose the species to even more toxic and complex combination of industrial chemicals (Verreault <em>et al</em>. 2005, 2006; Muir <em>et al</em>. 2006; Smithwick <em>et al</em>. 2006; McKinney <em>et al</em>. 2009, 2011; Gebbink <em>et al</em>. submitted). The potential for contam­inants to impact Arctic systems is predicted to increase as climate warming alters global circulation and precipitation patterns (Macdonald <em>et al</em>. 2005, Jenssen <em>et al</em>. 2015) and predicting local and regional effects will become more complicated and uncertain.<br/><br/>A three decade study (1983-2010) of East Greenland Polar Bears revealed both declines of conventional POPs and increases in brominated flame retardants (BFRs) and PFCs (Dietz <em>et al</em>. 2008, 2013a,b; Riget <em>et al</em>. 2013). The last decade has showed climate related increases in PCBs as well as peaks of BFRs and PFCs due to recent industrial reductions (Dietz <em>et al</em>. 2013b McKinney <em>et al</em>. 2013).<br/><br/>Although the effects of pollutants on polar bears are only partially understood, levels of such pollutants in some subpopulations are already sufficiently high that they may interfere with hormone regulation, immune system function, and possibly reproduction (Wiig <em>et al</em>. 1998; Bernhoft <em>et al</em>. 2000; Skaare <em>et al</em>. 2000, 2001; Gustavson <em>et al</em>. 2015; Henriksen <em>et al</em>. 2001; Derocher <em>et al</em>. 2003; Derocher 2005; Dietz <em>et al</em>. 2015; Sonne <em>et al</em>. 2015). There are suggestions that species with delayed implantation are more vulnerable to the effects of pollution through endocrine (hormone) disruption (Knott <em>et al</em>. 2011). Further, because female Polar Bears are food deprived during gestation, their pollution load increases in their blood, when energy and pollutants are mobilized from their adipose tissue. Because the cubs are nursed on fat rich milk they are exposed to very high pollution loads from their mother (Polishuk <em>et al</em>. 2002, Bytingsvik <em>et al</em>. 2012). This may pose the greatest threat to the species as the vulnerability of pre- and neonatal polar bears is the most sensible to life-long health effects from long-range transported pollution which decreases immunity, survival and reproductive success (Letcher <em>et al</em>. 2010, Sonne 2010).<br/><br/>An additional emerging threat to Polar Bears is the increase in resource exploration and development in the Arctic along with increased ice-breaking and shipping. There are currently no data on the effects of ice-breaking on habitat use by Polar Bears. Although some studies suggest that Polar Bears are sensitive to localized disturbance at maternity den sites (Lunn <em>et al</em>. 2004, Durner <em>et al</em>. 2006), our knowledge about potential effects of large scale development is lacking.<br/><br/>Oil development in the Arctic poses a wide of range of threats to Polar Bears ranging from oil spills to increased human-bear interactions. It is probable that an oil spill in sea ice habitat would result in oil being concentrated in leads and between ice floes resulting in both Plar Bears and their main prey (Ringed Seal and Bearded Seal) being directly exposed to oil. Polar Bears are often attracted by the smells and sound associated with human activity. Polar Bears are known to ingest plastic, styrofoam, lead acid batteries, tin cans, oil, and other hazardous materials with lethal consequences in some cases (Lunn and Stirling 1985, Amstrup <em>et al</em>. 1989, Derocher and Stirling 1991). Another concern is that seals covered in oil may be a major source of oil to polar bears. Although the biological threats and impacts of oil and gas activities on Polar Bears are reasonably well understood (Øritsland <em>et al</em>. 1981; Hurst and Øritsland 1982; Stirling 1988, 1990; Isaksen <em>et al</em>. 1998; Amstrup <em>et al</em>. 2006), mitigation and response plans are currently lacking (but see Wilson <em>et al</em>. 2014). Moreover, how Polar Bears will be affected by other types of human activity are less well known (Vongraven <em>et al</em>. 2012).<br/><br/>Significant portions of the Polar Bear’s range already are being developed and exploration is proposed for many other areas. With warming induced sea ice decline, previously inaccess­ible areas will be exposed to development and other forms of anthropogenic activities (e.g., trans-Arctic shipping, tourism). The direct effects of human activities, the in­creased potential for negative human-bear encounters, and the potential for increased local pollution are all concerns that must be understood if we are to understand and manage impacts on the future for Polar Bears.<br/><br/>Our understanding of Polar Bear population dynamics has improved with ongoing development and refinement of analytical methods (e.g., Taylor <em>et al</em>. 1987, 2002, 2005, 2006, 2008a,b, 2009; Amstrup <em>et al</em>. 2001; McDonald and Amstrup 2001; Regehr <em>et al</em>. 2007, 2010, 2015; Aars <em>et al</em>. 2009; Stapleton <em>et al</em>. 2014). These improved and new tools suggest that previous estimates of population parameters and numbers can be biased. Vital rates are subpopulation specific, and different from the generalized rates that were often used to generate previous status reports (Taylor <em>et al</em>. 1987). For the two subpopulations (Southern Beaufort Sea, Western Hudson Bay) that are known to have been impacted by climate change and where a long time series of abundance exist, harvest represents an additive impact. Illegal take of polar bears in Russia, combined with legal subsistence harvest in the U.S., may exceed sustainable limits for the Chukchi subpopulation (<a href=""http://pbsg.npolar.no/en/"">pbsg.npolar.no</a>). In many cases harvest documentation and the popula­tion data necessary to assess the impact of harvest both are insufficient to allow managers to provide the desired balance between potential yield and take. Given the cultural and eco­nomic importance of Polar Bear hunting in many regions, understanding the potential for and the impact of hunting continues to be a critical part of management (Obbard <em>et al</em>. 2010, Vongraven <em>et al</em>. 2012, <a href=""http://pbsg.npolar.no/en/"">pbsg.npolar.no</a>).<br/><br/>It is important that subpopulation estimates and projections are based on substantiated scientific data. In some areas, studies to estimate abundance occur infrequently so if the harvest rate is either initially set above the sustainable level or it becomes so, the subpopulation may be reduced before the next inventory is made. In addition, harvest practices may have to be reconsidered given recent knowledge about long-term environmental trends and fluctuations that can affect sustainable removal rates. In some jurisdictions in Canada, the governance system includes aboriginal co-management boards and aboriginal hunting organizations. In some of these co-management systems, both local knowledge and science are to be considered equally in both management and research decisions. Although scientific studies have concluded that the long-term effects of capturing and collaring polar bears are minimal (Ramsay and Stirling 1986, Messier 2000, Thiemann <em>et al</em>. 2013, Rode <em>et al</em>. 2014a), some local groups nevertheless consider these techniques disrespectful or harmful to the animals. As a result, population inventory and ecological studies have been delayed or not permitted. On the other hand, alternative research techniques such as aerial surveys and genetic biopsy capture-recapture methods were designed and implemented. Reduced monitoring will constrain governments’ ability to assess sustainability of harvest especially if abundance is estimated from aerial surveys which cannot provide data on vital rates (Aars <em>et al</em>. 2009, Stapleton <em>et al</em>. 2014).<br/><br/>Human caused habitat change and increasing human-bear interactions also must be incorporated into polar bear population projections (e.g., Hunter <em>et al</em>. 2010) and polar bear harvest management in the future. Due to increased access to pre­viously isolated areas, Polar Bears will face increased risks from a variety of human–bear interactions. New settlements are possible with industrial development, and expansion of tourist visitations is assured. Although the fact of human–bear interactions can be reasonably measured, we have a long way to go to understand the effect of such interactions. The added stresses, resulting from a “more crowded” Arctic, may play an important role in the future welfare of Polar Bears.","At present, 19 subpopulation units of Polar Bears are recognized by the Polar Bear Specialist Group (PBSG) of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (Obbard <em>et al</em>. 2010). Genetic studies have shown that gene flow occurs among the various subpopulations (Paetkau <em>et al</em>. 1999, Crompton <em>et al</em>. 2008, Peacock <em>et al</em>. 2015) and there is no evidence that any of the units have been evolutionarily separated for significant periods of time. Although demographic exchange may be limited between subpopulations (Mauritzen <em>et al</em>. 2002, Crompton <em>et al</em>. 2008, Peacock <em>et al</em>. 2015), some demographic and genetic exchange occurs. Consequently, the Polar Bear subpopulations cannot be considered as distinct demographic units and the term “management units” may be more accurate. Ongoing reductions in the duration, distribution, and quality of sea ice due to climate change (Sahanatien and Derocher 2012) may result in different levels of genetic and demographic exchange among subpopulations in the future (Derocher <em>et al</em>. 2004, Molnár <em>et al</em>. 2010), which could lead to&#160; new metapopulation dynamics or to functionally isolated subpopulations.<br/><br/>The PBSG summarized the best-available scientific information on the status of the 19 subpopulations of Polar Bears in 2014 (PBSG 2015) including an assessment of current trend (i.e., estimated change in population size over a 12-year period, centred on the time of assessment). The PBSG concluded that one subpopulation (M’Clintock Channel) has increased, six were stable (Davis Strait, Foxe Basin, Gulf of Boothia, Northern Beaufort Sea, Southern Hudson Bay, and Western Hudson Bay), three were considered to have declined (Baffin Bay, Kane Basin, and Southern Beaufort Sea) and, for the remaining nine (Arctic Basin, Barents Sea, Chukchi Sea, East Greenland, Kara Sea, Lancaster Sound, Laptev Sea, Norwegian Bay, and Viscount Melville Sound) there were insufficient data to provide an assessment of current trend. The type, precision, and time span of data used to estimate trends varies among subpopulations (PBSG 2015).<br/><br/>Estimating Polar Bear abundance is expensive and difficult because the animals often occur at low densities in remote habitats. Although abundance estimates have generally improved in recent decades (Obbard <em>et al</em>. 2010), information remains poor or outdated for some subpopulations. Summing across the most recent estimates for the 19 subpopulations (Table 3 in the Supplementary Material) results in a total of approximately 26,000 Polar Bears ( 95% CI = 22,000-31,000 ). We note that this number differs from what would be obtained by summing abundance estimates in PBSG (2015), because criteria were not the same for including abundance estimates in the two sources (section Population projections). The total number presented here does not include the Arctic Basin subpopulation, for which no information on abundance is available. The 95% confidence intervals presented here were generated using simulation based on estimates of uncertainty in Table 3 and an assumption that the abundance of every subpopulation is independent of the others (see the section <em>Population projections</em> in the Supplementary Material). The mixed quality and even lack of available information on each subpopulation means caution is warranted when establishing and reporting a single estimate of the number of polar bears across the circumpolar Arctic. Therefore we used the abundance data in Table 3 in a relative manner, to scale subpopulation-specific changes to changes in the global population size, rather than in an absolute manner.<br/><p></p>",Unknown,"<p>Polar Bears live throughout the ice-covered waters of the circumpolar Arctic (Obbard <em>et al.</em> 2010, <a href=""http://www.pbsg.npolar.no"">www.pbsg.npolar.no</a>). Although some occur in the permanent multi-year pack ice of the central Arctic basin, they are most common in the annual ice over the continental shelf and inter-island archipelagos that surround the polar basin. Polar Bears that have continuous access to sea ice are able to hunt throughout the year. However, in those areas where the sea ice melts completely each summer,&#160;Polar Bears&#160;are forced to spend several months on land, where they primarily fast on stored fat reserves until freeze-up. Use of land by&#160;Polar Bears&#160;during the ice-free season appears to be increasing at least in some areas where sea ice duration has declined (e.g., Schliebe <em>et al.</em> 2008, Herreman and Peacock 2013).&#160;The southern extent of the range of&#160;Polar Bears&#160;occurs off the coast of Newfoundland, Canada in the northwest Atlantic Ocean. The northernmost documented observation of a&#160;Polar Bear&#160;was at 89°46’N, 25 km from the North Pole (van Meurs and Splettstoesser 2003).&#160;Currently, the most southerly known denning area is on Akimiski Island in James Bay, Canada, at about 52°35’N (Kolenosky and Prevett 1983).</p><p>The species is found in Canada (Manitoba, Newfoundland, Labrador, Nunavut, Northwest Territories, Quebec, Yukon Territory, Ontario), Greenland/Denmark, Norway (including Svalbard), Russian Federation (North European Russia, Siberia, Chukotka, Sakha (Yakutia), Krasnoyarsk), United States (Alaska). Also, vagrants occasionally reach Iceland.</p>","The US, Canada, and Greenland allow and manage a subsistence harvest of Polar Bears; harvest is prohibited in Norway and Russia. The principal use of Polar Bears is for subsistence purposes (Obbard <em>et al</em>. 2010, <a href=""www.pbsg.npolar.no"">www.pbsg.npolar.no</a>), including consumption of meat; use of hides for clothing; and small scale handicrafts. Whole hides may be used for subsistence needs, kept as trophies, or sold on open markets. The financial return from the sale of legally taken Polar Bear hides can provide important income for local people in Canada and Greenland. Sport hunting of Polar Bears only occurs in Canada and must be guided by local Inuit hunters. While communities can decide whether or not to allow sport hunts, these hunts must be accounted for within the annual quota assigned to a community; sport hunts are not additive to the quota. Sport hunting can be a major source of income for remote settlements because the financial return from the hunt greatly exceeds that of the hide value (Foote and Wenzel 2009). This often provides an important infusion into local, cash limited, economies.<br/><br/>Annual legal harvest of Polar Bears is between 700 and 800 or 3-4% of the estimated size of the total population of about 20-25,000 animals. The harvest level has been thought to be sustainable in most subpopulations (PBSG 2010). Although poaching, or illegal hunting of Polar Bears, is not thought to be of major concern, recent reports suggest that illegal hunting in eastern Russia may be as high as 100-200 bears per year (Kochnev 2004). At present, the PBSG is assessing the status of this problem in all jurisdictions. Mortality of bears in defence of life and property occur throughout the Polar Bears’ range and are probably inevitable in areas where Polar Bears and people co-exist.<br/><br/>Polar Bear based tourism, including public viewing and photography is increasing. Well established in Churchill, Canada, it is increasing in other remote areas, including Svalbard, Norway, and to a some extent in locations on the north coast of Alaska (primarily Kaktovik and to a lesser degree Barrow).<br/><br/>Polar Bear products are in trade. The range of different products and units of measure used in records makes it difficult to relate trade data to number of polar bears in trade. Export of Polar Bear products from Canada, where most polar bear products in trade originate, represented between 207 (2014) and 404 (2013) individuals in the period 2010-2014 (Canadian CITES authorities pers. comm.). Greenland introduced a voluntary temporary ban on export of Polar Bear products in 2007. All international trade in polar bear parts is surveyed and regulated by CITES. The polar bear is listed by CITES on Appendix II.",Terrestrial|Marine,"Conservation actions for Polar Bears vary by jurisdiction and detailed information can be found in Obbard <em>et al</em>. (2010) and at <a href=""www.pbsg.npolar.no"">www.pbsg.npolar.no</a>. The International Agreement on the Conservation of Polar Bears that was signed in 1973 by the five nations Canada, Denmark (Greenland) Norway, Soviet Union (Russian Federation) and USA, provides guidance. Article II of the Agreement states that each contracting party “…shall manage polar bear populations in accordance with sound conservation practices based on the best available scientific data,…” and according to Article VII, “The Contracting Parties shall conduct national research programs on Polar Bears…” and&#160; “...consult with each other on the management of migrating Polar Bear populations...”. These articles have been important for stimulating governments to support applied research to answer management questions regarding Polar Bears throughout their range.<br/><br/>In light of the growing concern over Polar Bear conservation in relation to climate change and a number of other issues, such as oil- and gas activities, shipping and tourism, the five Parties have agreed to initiate a process that would lead to a coordinated approach to conservation and management strategies for Polar Bears. A key aspect of this approach is the recognition that plans for action should be developed at a national level leading up to development of comprehensive circumpolar plan for action that address Polar Bear conservation. The Circumpolar Action Plan for Polar Bear is planned to be signed by the parties in autumn 2015.<br/><br/>The Parties recognize that Article VII of the Agreement calls for all Parties to conduct national research programs, particularly relating to the conservation and management of Polar Bears, and that they shall coordinate such research and exchange information on research programs, results, and data on bears taken. The Parties continue to be committed to carrying out research in support of Polar Bear conservation. The Parties also recognize that the technical support and scientific advice on Polar Bear conservation provided by the PBSG supports the 1973 Agreement and is a vital part of the decision making process that the competent authorities should consider in making management decisions. The PBSG has accepted to serve as an independent science advisory body to the Parties.<br/><br/>The PBSG regards the 1973 Agreement as the cornerstone and basis for any action plan on Polar Bears. The PBSG has identified the following research elements to be included in all action plans (Vongraven <em>et al</em>. 2012):<br/><ul><li>Assessment of subpopulation size and/or trend and projection of future status</li><li>Monitoring harvest and other removals</li><li>Understanding movements and distribution patterns and how they are changing with ongoing habitat changes</li><li>Establishing trends in physical condition and why they are changing</li><li>Documenting human-bear conflicts</li><li>Documenting trends in habitat use, availability and trends</li><li>Documenting trends in pollution and disease</li><li>Vital rates estimation, evaluating trends and projection</li></ul>The PBSG recognizes that particular elements (for example, monitoring of pollution and sea ice habitat) are of inter-jurisdictional concern and would benefit from multi-jurisdictional cooperation. Further, the Parties shall consult with each other on the management of shared Polar Bear subpopulations, and exchange information on research and management programs. The PBSG has reiterated that all management actions be based on the best scientific information. The PBSG has identified these management elements to be included in all action plans (Vongraven <em>et al</em>. 2012):<br/><ul><li>Protection of essential habitats</li><li>Use of scientific evidence</li><li>Monitoring, prevention and sound management of human-bear conflicts</li><li>Development of inter-jurisdictional agreements for shared populations</li><li>Development of management strategies to minimize impacts of human activities (e.g. mining, shipping, oil and gas activities, tourism and other human-caused disturbance)</li><li>Management of sustainable harvest</li><li>Ensure the active involvement of the local public living in polar bear areas in developing and achieving the goals of the action plan </li></ul><p></p>",Nearctic|Palearctic,,false,false,Global

Spawning occurs in fresh water, over sandy-gravel substrates, rocks, and aquatic plants (Moyle 2002). Anadromous populations spawn in fresh water close to the ocean. After hatching, larvae move up into surface waters and are transported downstream into brackish-water nursery areas.

Declines in the Sacramento-San Joaquin estuary in California are due mainly to the effects of water diversions from the Delta (Moyle 2002). Low flows result in upstream movement of the productive freshwater-saltwater mixing zone, constricting the size of favorable habitat and making the fishes vulnerable to diversion into water project pumps and structures (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 1994). It is unlikely that many individuals survive entrainment, but the degree of effect on larvae is not well known (Moyle et al. 1995). Low flows also fail to disperse larvae downstream into productive nursery areas in Suisun Bay (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 1994, Moyle et al. 1995). The causes for decline in the northern California estuaries are unknown but probably similar to the causes for declines in the Sacramento-San Joaquin estuary (Moyle et al. 1995, Moyle 2002). <br/><br/>Other potential threats include pesticide runoff from agricultural areas and invasions by exotic species such as clams and copepods (Moyle et al. 1995, Moyle 2002). Sedimentation due to human activities may also have an effect on northern California estuaries. The loss of tidal marsh habitat and resulting reduced productivity, together with reduced flows in the Mad River due to water diversions and land reclamation, may have caused disappearance from Humboldt Bay, California. Due to a two-year life cycle, relatively brief periods of reproductive failure could lead to extirpations (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 1994).","This species is represented by at least a couple dozen subpopulations (counting each estuary as a single occurrence or subpopulation).<br/><br/>Total adult population size is unknown but presumably exceeds 100,000.

Adults live at moderate sea depths (commonly 20-200 m but have been recorded as deep as 625 m) in echo-sounding layer not far from shore; young apparently occur in deeper water (Lee et al. 1980, Page and Burr 1991, Willson et al. 2003).

Presence of spring freshets is a factor common to nearly all spawning streams or rivers; typically characteristic of rivers that drain large snowpacks or glaciers (Hay and McCarter 2000, Willson et al. 2003).","Threatened by overfishing in subsistence and commercial fisheries, continued/increased bycatch in commercial groundfish and shrimp fisheries, industry pollution of freshwater and marine habitats, human impact on spawning habitat (logging, dredging, diversions, etc.) and climate change (Hay and McCarter 2000). <br/><br/>Subsistence harvest is widespread throughout this species' range, is mostly unregulated, and could potentially slow recovery of declining populations. Bycatch of eulachon in commercial offshore groundfish and shrimp trawl fisheries may be substantial; shrimp trawling, especially, has increased in the last decade (Hay and McCarter 2000). <br/><br/>Threats to eulachon habitat include diversions/dams, logging, dredging and industrial pollution of streams and rivers, all of which may affect water volume, temperature and sediment levels in spawning habitat. Native communities in Southeast Alaska have noted declining eulachon harvests and expressed concern about the effects of log rafting and pollution on fish habitat (Drake and Wilson 1991). <br/><br/>Recent changes in ocean climate, including increased surface water temperatures, have been recognized in the Gulf of Alaska and elsewhere in the species range, and have resulted in a general reorganization of fish communities in some areas (Anderson and Piatt 1999, Hay and McCarter 2000). High water temperatures can be lethal to cold-water acclimated fish.  A study of 5°C-acclimated eulachon immersed in 11°C water for several days resulted in 50% mortality and spawning failure (Blahm and McConnell 1971 in Willson et al. 2003).","This species is represented by a large number of subpopulations and locations.<br/><br/>In Alaska, this species is seasonally abundant from Southeast to Cook Inlet (Hay et al. 1997); abundance decreases from east to west toward the Aleutian Islands (Bartlett 1994). Relative abundance in the Bering Sea is highest between Unimak Island/end of the Alaska Peninsula and the Pribilof Islands (Anderson, in Willson et al. 2003). Eulachon is reported as widespread in trawl samples in the coastal fjords of northern southeast Alaska (Willson et al. 2003). Catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) in the Gulf of Alaska varied almost cyclically between 1972 and 1997 from ~0.3 kg/km to ~1.9 kg/km (Anderson and Piatt 1999). However, catch data are not necessarily considered a reliable measure of population abundance or even presence/absence (NMFS 1999), nor are they available for species' entire range in the state.<br/><br/>Highly variable or possibly cyclical run size makes trends in abundance hard to interpret (NMFS 1999). Nearly all runs in the southern part of their range (California to BC) have declined during the last 20 years (Hay and McCarter 2000). Commercial catches on the Fraser River have declined since the 1940s and 1950s (Hay et al. 1997). In 1994, sudden drastic declines were recorded in three large southern rivers, the Fraser, Columbia, and Klinaklini, resulting in the closure of major commercial fisheries on the Fraser and Columbia Rivers in the late 1990s (Hay and McCarter 2000, Willson et al. 2003). Due to continued low abundance, NMFS was petitioned to list the Columbia River populations as endangered or threatened under the Endangered Species Act (ESA) in 1999.

Therefore, this species is listed as Least Concern.","<em>Malacosteus niger </em>exhibits unique ecological characteristics in comparison with other Stomiiformes. It is believed to be the only member of the family that does not undergo diel, vertical migrations, and only occasionally moves up the water column into the lower epipelagic zone (Clarke 1974,&#160;Kenaley 2007).<br/><br/>Diet analysis of <em>M. niger</em> indicates that copepods comprise a major component of this species' diet, with only a small amount of other micronekton components. Copepods account for 83% of prey numbers and 47% of prey biomass, as indicated by intestinal contents of samples taken (Sutton and Hopkins 1996). These data are singular in that<em> Malacosteus niger</em> represents an extreme departure in stomiid feeding. This species has the largest gape of any stomiid (Sutton unpublished data), and lacks gill rakers as an adult, indicating that larger, micronekton would more probably be the preferred dietary choice for this species. The large gape and lack of gillrakers as an adult while feeding on copepods may indicate a secondary reversion to planktivory (Sutton and Hopkins 1996). This seeming discrepancy is explained in that the ingestion of copepods provides <em>M. niger </em>with&#160;the raw material needed for long-wave visual sensitivity, while at mesopelagic depths, eliminating the need to undergo DVM (Douglas <em>et al.</em> 1999). Kenaley and Sutton (unpublished data) posed that when the nutritional state of an individual deteriorates after prolonged ""snacking'' on copepods, it may be stimulated to revert to piscivory and utilize this stealthy visual mechanism in the epipelagic zone where high densities of teleost prey aggregate on a diel cycle.<br/><br/>In a study conducted in 1970-1971 near the island of Oahu, Hawaii, it was determined that <em>M. niger</em>&#160;shows no seasonality in reproduction. Possibly the larvae of<em> M. niger</em>, which exhibit no seasonality, either hatch at a larger size or live at greater depths than those of the seasonal species and thus the former's spawning is not timed to any seasonal fluctuations in food concentration or size distribution in the upper layers (Clarke 1974).",There are no known threats towards this species.,"There are 500 records of this specimen in 453 geocodes.

43526147,6494,Dermochelys coriacea,Vulnerable,A2bd,2013,2013-06-21 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<p><em>Rationale</em></p><p>The global population of Leatherback turtles (<em>Dermochelys coriacea</em>) comprises seven subpopulations (see Figure 2 in Supplementary Material) that vary widely in population size, geographic range, and population trends, and are the appropriate units for assessment of global conservation status for this species (Wallace <em>et al</em>. 2010, 2011). As such, we performed assessments for each of the seven subpopulations, in addition to the combined global population assessment required by the IUCN (see Table 1 in&#160;Supplementary Material). Due to this species’ geographically widespread distribution, Criterion A was the only appropriate criterion for assessment that could be applied to the global Leatherback population. Generation length was estimated as 30 years. Estimation of global population change based on subpopulation trends (weighted by subpopulation sizes relative to the global population size) produced an estimate of -40.1% decline over the past three generations (see Table 2 in&#160;Supplementary Material), corresponding to a category of <em>Vulnerable based on Criterion A2 (i.e., threats are not reversible nor have they ceased), subcriteria b (i.e., an index of abundance appropriate to the taxon—annual nest counts—was used) and d (i.e., decline was due to actual or potential levels of exploitation)</em>. In contrast, assessment of the data under Criterion A4—past, present, and future abundance—revealed that the global Leatherback population trends over three generations will no longer meet thresholds for threat categories by 2020 (-29.4%), and will be increasing by 2030 (3%) and beyond (104% by 2040) (see Table 3 in&#160;Supplementary Material). Therefore, within the next ten years, the global Leatherback population might no longer qualify as “Threatened”—i.e. a category listing of Vulnerable, Endangered, or Critically Endangered—according to the IUCN Red List Criteria.</p><p>	However, future population increases will be dependent on the success of conservation actions mitigating current and future threats to this species throughout its range, especially in breeding and foraging areas, and on no new threats arising (e.g. climate change) that could cause population declines. Moreover, nearly 99% of the global population (based on data available currently) will be contained within the Northwest Atlantic, which obscures the declines of the Pacific subpopulations and threatened status of other relatively small subpopulations (e.g. Southwest Atlantic, Southwest Indian) (see Figure 3 in&#160;Supplementary Material), not to mention data deficient subpopulations (Northeast Indian, Southeast Atlantic). While these results demonstrate that Leatherbacks, as a single taxonomic entity, will not go extinct globally in the next generation, the global listing is not an appropriate representation of the conservation status of the biologically relevant subpopulations that make up the global Leatherback population. For this reason, the subpopulation-level Red List assessments for Leatherbacks should be given priority in evaluating the true global extinction risk for this species.<br/><br/><em>Justification</em></p>  <p>Comprehensive analyses of 39 existing datasets—including 28 time series datasets with ≥10 years of data—of abundance of nesting females or their nesting activities on beaches revealed different population trends among subpopulations, but a global decline overall based on subpopulation trends weighted by subpopulation size three generations ago relative to combined global population size (see Table 2 in&#160;Supplementary Material&#160;for all datasets used). Overall, considering only datasets with ≥10 yr of abundance data, the total global abundance across Leatherback subpopulations had declined from 90,599 nests yr<sup>-1</sup> to 54,262 nests yr<sup>-1</sup> over three generations until 2010. Using average conversion factors from different subpopulations to provide bracketed estimates of nesting female abundance (i.e. 5 and 7 clutches per female, three years for re-migration intervals, intermediate between subpopulation averages; TEWG 2007, Reina <em>et al</em>. 2002), these annual nesting abundance values correspond to approximately 12,943-18,120 nesting females yr<sup>-1 </sup>(or 38,828-54,359 adult females) three generations ago and 7,752-10,852 nesting females yr<sup>-1</sup> (or 23,255-32,557 adult females) in 2010. Because we did not include abundance data from several rookeries that had &lt;10 yr of data—including Gabon, which is the largest Leatherback rookery in the world (Witt <em>et al</em>. 2009), as well as Grand Riviere and Fishing Pond, Trinidad, Armila, Panama, and Gulf of Urubá, Colombia (TEWG 2007, Patiño-Martínez <em>et al</em>. 2008)—in our annual and total abundance subpopulation and global abundance estimates, these values should be considered conservative estimates.</p>  <p>Overall, although the global listing for Leatherbacks was derived by abundance-weighted analyses of three-generation trends for all subpopulations with available data, it is not an appropriate representation of conservation status of biologically relevant population units (i.e. subpopulations) that make up the global Leatherback population. Subpopulation assessments demonstrated wide variation not only in status of individual subpopulations (as indicated by the Red List Categories), but also in how categories were derived for each subpopulation (as indicated by the Red List Criteria used) (see Table 1 in&#160;Supplementary Material). Specifically, final threat categories were triggered by thresholds under different criteria, depending on whether a subpopulation has declined significantly over time (e.g. East Pacific, West Pacific), was geographically constrained (e.g. Southwest Indian Ocean), or characterized by small (e.g. Southwest Indian Ocean) or very small population sizes (e.g. Southwest Atlantic Ocean). Therefore, the variation in conservation status among subpopulations warrants preference for subpopulation assessments over the global assessment when evaluating and describing the global conservation status of Leatherbacks.</p>  <p>Presently, the Northwest Atlantic subpopulation—i.e. from Florida, USA throughout the Wider Caribbean—is large and increasing (TEWG 2007) (Table 2 in&#160;Supplementary Material). Furthermore, the Southeast Atlantic subpopulation—i.e. West Africa, especially Gabon—is the largest in the world (Witt <em>et al</em>. 2009), but long-term trend data are not available for this assessment (TEWG 2007). The existence of these large (and increasing in at least one case) subpopulations makes it extremely unlikely that Leatherbacks globally will go extinct in the near future. If current trends in the Northwest Atlantic subpopulation continue, the global population trend might no longer meet thresholds for IUCN Threatened categories (i.e., Vulnerable, Endangered, Critically Endangered) within ten years (Table 3 in&#160;Supplementary Material). In fact, if current trends continue, future global population sizes are projected to increase to 184,662 nests yr<sup>-1</sup> (approximately 26,380-36,932 females yr<sup>-1</sup>, 79,141-110,797 adult females total) within one generation (i.e. by 2040). The projected abundance of the Northwest Atlantic subpopulation alone will account for nearly 99% of the global Leatherback population abundance by that time (Figure 3 and Table 3 in&#160;Supplementary Material), and increase from 46% of historical global population abundance three generations ago.</p>  <p>In spite of the large and increasing Northwest Atlantic subpopulation, the magnitudes of declines for the East Pacific subpopulation (i.e., which nests along the Pacific coast of the Americas) and, to a slightly lesser extent, the West Pacific subpopulation (i.e., Malaysia, Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands) over three generations were the main driver the global decline result. Specifically, the East Pacific subpopulation has declined by <em>&gt; </em>97% over three generations (from &gt;35,000 nests yr<sup>-1</sup> to &lt;1,000 nests yr<sup>-1</sup>, or &gt;5,000 nesting females yr<sup>-1</sup> to &lt; 140 nesting females yr<sup>-1</sup>) (Eckert 1993, Santidrián Tomillo <em>et al</em>. 2007, Sarti Martínez <em>et al</em>. 2007), and its historic abundance accounted for roughly 39% of the estimated global abundance three generations ago (Table 1 in&#160;Supplementary Material). Similarly, the West Pacific subpopulation has declined &gt;80% over three generations, from &gt;12,000 nests yr<sup>-1</sup> (2,600 females yr<sup>-1</sup>) to &lt;2,200 nests yr<sup>-1</sup> (&lt;500 females yr<sup>-1</sup>) (Eckert 1993, Chan and Liew 1996, Dutton <em>et al</em>. 2007, Hitipeuw <em>et al</em>. 2007, Tapilatu <em>et al</em>. 2013), and its historic abundance accounted for 14% of the estimated global abundance three generations ago. Both of these subpopulations are projected to decline further in coming decades (Table 3 in&#160;Supplementary Material). Population declines in these subpopulations (and others) have been attributed to extensive egg harvest and mortality due to incidental capture in fishing gear (Eckert 1993, Wallace and Saba 2009, Tapilatu <em>et al</em>. 2013). Considering the precedent of the collapse of the historically large Pacific subpopulations, the persistence of significant threats in all regions (see Wallace <em>et al.</em> 2011 and Eckert <em>et al</em>. 2012 for review) warrants concern for the future viability of even the largest subpopulations. Current efforts to protect Leatherbacks, their offspring, and their habitats must be maintained—or even augmented, where possible—to reverse declines in Pacific and Indian Ocean subpopulations and to sustain population growth in the Northwest Atlantic.</p>  <p>To explore future projections of Leatherback subpopulation and global abundance and trends, we also applied Criterion A4, which analyzes the global population trend within time intervals from the past, present, and future (Table 3 in&#160;Supplementary Material). Because the length of three generations (~90 yr) was greater than the length of our available datasets, we used the historical abundance values shown in Tables 3 and 4 (see&#160;Supplementary Material) as the baseline population sizes for “moving window” analyses. According to our assessment of the data under Criterion A4, it would no longer qualify as “Threatened” according to IUCN Red List Criteria by 2020 (three-generation decline of 29.4%), and would qualify as Least Concern by 2030 (3% increase) under IUCN Guidelines (IUCN 2011) (Table 3 in&#160;Supplementary Material). This discrepancy between A4 and A2 illustrates a dichotomy in how extinction risk is assessed by these two criteria, despite the same empirical data being used for assessments. Whereas A2 assesses percent decline over time, using the historical abundance as the baseline, A4 uses historical as well as current abundance to project future abundance, and as such accounts for recent growth in subpopulations in the global population estimate. Because the IUCN Guidelines stipulate that multiple criteria be evaluated, the criterion that triggers the highest threat category must be selected for the official assessment. Therefore, Leatherbacks globally are considered <em>Vulnerable (A2b,d)</em> based on IUCN Guidelines (IUCN 2011). </p>  <p>Nonetheless, these results further illustrate the inability of the global assessment to adequately characterize variation among subpopulations. The likelihood of global extinction of this species is extremely low (Tables 2 and 3 in&#160;Supplementary Material); however, the Northwest Atlantic subpopulation alone is projected to account for nearly 99% of total global Leatherback abundance by 2040, with four other subpopulations for which data were available for this assessment accounting for the remaining 1% (Figure 3 and Table 3 in&#160;Supplementary Material). Such a global assessment produces a result indicating no risk of species-level extinction based on the mere existence of any Leatherback subpopulation, while obscuring the dire conservation situation of declining or extinct subpopulations (e.g., the Pacific subpopulations). This type of assessment and its result are contrary to the <a href=""http://iucn-mtsg.org/about/vision-mission/"">IUCN SSC Marine Turtle Specialist Group’s (MTSG) mission</a> to guide conservation of marine turtles and their ecological roles. For these reasons, the MTSG defined subpopulations (i.e., regional management units; Wallace <em>et al</em>. 2010) for all marine turtle species, including Leatherbacks, to provide a biologically described framework for evaluating conservation status of appropriate population segments. A global marine turtle population is an amalgam of its subpopulations, all of which are valuable for maintaining the health of the “species” in terms of evolutionary history, genetic diversity, and life history variations. For these reasons, the inability of marine turtle global assessments to appropriately account for variation among subpopulations (see Seminoff and Shanker 2008 for review) further supports the primacy of subpopulation assessments when describing conservation status of marine turtles globally.</p>  <p>Previous global Leatherback assessments (Pritchard 1982, Spotila <em>et al</em>. 1996), including the previous Leatherback Red List assessment (Sarti Martinez 2000), also described global declines in Leatherbacks. However, these previous assessments lacked the geographic breadth and rigour of time series datasets accessed for the current assessment. Spotila <em>et al</em>. (1996) estimated the global Leatherback population in 1995 to be approximately 34,500 adult females (range: 26,200-42,900 females), and stated that this value was roughly a third of the only existing global estimate at the time (115,000 adult females; Pritchard 1982). However, there were several significant assumptions in the Pritchard (1982) estimate that make its use as a reliable global population estimate tenuous, not the least of which was the lack of robust, nesting beach-based estimates of the East Pacific subpopulation abundance on which the regional and global estimates were constructed (see Mrosovsky 2003 for review). Sarti Martinez (2000) assessed the global Leatherback population as Critically Endangered largely on the evidence of significant declines in the East Pacific subpopulation (based on the Pritchard [1982] and Spotila <em>et al</em>. [1996] estimates) and Malaysian rookery, despite some indications of large populations in other regions, such as the Northwest and Southeast Atlantic.</p>  <p>In addition, abundance of several rookeries has increased substantially in the time since these assessments were conducted. For example, estimates for Trinidad, St. Croix, Puerto Rico, and Florida used by Spotila <em>et al</em>. (1996) were all substantially lower—by an order of magnitude in some cases—than current estimates (Table 3 in&#160;Supplementary Material). Furthermore, the current assessment only included time series datasets of a decade or longer in abundance estimates, whereas Spotila <em>et al</em>. (1996) included abundance estimates based on variable numbers of nesting seasons. The 2010 abundance estimates presented in the current assessment are generally lower, but overlap with the 1995 range in estimated abundance reported by Spotila et al. (1996). If abundance estimates from all rookeries with available nesting data (e.g. Panama [~8,000 nests yr<sup>-1</sup>], Colombia [2,300 nests yr<sup>-1</sup>], Trinidad [&gt;40,000 nests yr<sup>-1</sup>, and especially Gabon [36,185-126,480 nests yr<sup>-1</sup>]; Table 3 in&#160;Supplementary Material) were included in the 2010 assessment, the total global abundance of Leatherbacks in 2010 would be much higher than the estimate shown in Table 3, and would exceed the average estimate of Spotila <em>et al</em>. (1996). However, this is not necessarily indicative of a global population increase, but rather an increase in available information. Therefore, given the availability of new datasets from all Leatherback subpopulations globally, use of previous estimates (Pritchard 1982, Spotila <em>et al</em>. 1996) to characterize global Leatherback population abundance is no longer appropriate.</p>  <p>Interpreting the current assessment (2010) in the context of previous assessments and available data at present, the global Leatherback population has not collapsed, and, in fact, appears to be larger than estimated in previous global assessments (Spotila <em>et al</em>. 1996). This result appears counter-intuitive with the <em>Vulnerable</em> category to which this subpopulation has been assigned, but it can be traced to the nature of the procedure for applying Criterion A to long-lived, widely distributed species like marine turtles (see Seminoff and Shanker 2008 for review). The change in IUCN Red List Category from <em>Critically Endangered</em> (in 2000) to <em>Vulnerable</em> (assessment year 2010) is mostly due to new datasets made available for assessment, and associated detection of increasing trends that were not reported previously, as well as a rigorous application of the IUCN 3.1 Criteria. The continued severe declines of the Pacific subpopulations require urgent and effective conservation interventions to prevent complete collapse (Spotila <em>et al</em>. 2000, Santidrián Tomillo <em>et al</em>. 2007, Sarti Martínez <em>et al</em>. 2007, Tapilatu <em>et al</em>. 2013). Furthermore, the projected increase in the global population is predicated entirely on continued growth of the Northwest Atlantic subpopulation alone, which itself depends on sustained conservation efforts to protect Leatherbacks, their offspring, and their habitats.</p>  <p><em>Assessment Procedure:</em></p>  <p>Given the widespread, long-lived nature of Leatherback turtles, Criterion A (i.e., decline in population of mature individuals over time) is the only appropriate criterion that could be used for this assessment; the restricted geographic range and small population size criteria (Criterion B, C, and D) did not apply, and no population viability analysis was available (Criterion E). However, Criteria A-D were applied in subpopulation assessments (see Leatherback subpopulation assessments for details; Table 1 in&#160;Supplementary Material).</p>  <p>We obtained time series datasets of abundance of nesting females or their nesting activities collected on Leatherback rookeries (i.e., nesting beaches) around the world, and organized data by subpopulations. For marine turtles, annual counts of nesting females and their nesting activities (more often the latter) are the most frequently recorded and reported abundance metric across index monitoring sites, species, and geographic regions (NRC 2010). Conversion from number of nests to number of nesting females requires estimates of clutch frequency (i.e. number of clutches per nesting female per breeding season) (e.g. Reina <em>et al</em>. 2002), which are not available for all rookeries and subpopulations. Therefore, we presented and analysed all abundance data in numbers of confirmed nests yr<sup>-1</sup>, as this metric was the most commonly available (Table 2 in&#160;Supplementary Material). See <em>Sources of Uncertainty</em> for discussion of caveats associated with these conversion factors.</p>  <p>We calculated annual and overall population trends for each rookery within a subpopulation, and then calculated average subpopulation trends by weighting rookery population trends by rookery abundance 3 generations ago relative to subpopulation abundance three generations ago. We then repeated this step to derive the global population trend by weighting subpopulation trends by subpopulation abundance three generations ago relative to global abundance three generations ago (Table 2 in&#160;Supplementary Material). We only included time series datasets of ≥10 yr in trend estimations, although we included all rookeries for which we obtained abundance values in the overall summary tables (Table 2 in&#160;Supplementary Material). Because rookeries represent varying proportions of total subpopulation sizes, we ensured that time series from major rookeries within each subpopulation were included in analyses such that the majority of subpopulation abundance was represented. In cases where that was not possible (e.g. Southeast Atlantic, Northeast Indian), we did not derive a subpopulation trend, and such cases were excluded from calculation of global trends.</p>  <p>The most recent year for available abundance data across all rookeries and subpopulations was 2010. Where time series ended prior to 2010, we estimated population sizes for each rookery through 2010 based on the population trend for existing years (e.g. French Guiana, Trinidad). Furthermore, if a longer time series for a rookery within a subpopulation was available that reflected a trend not captured by shorter time series, we estimated historical abundance to calculate overall declines for that subpopulation. For example, abundance data for three of five index sites in the Mexican Pacific—the East Pacific subpopulation—begin in the early 1980s, while the remaining sites (i.e., Barra de la Cruz and Cahuitán, Oaxaca) begin in the early 1990s (Table 2 in&#160;Supplementary Material). All other sites in Mexico, as well as other sites within the same subpopulation (i.e., those in Costa Rica), showed a decline of &gt;97%, whereas the Barra de la Cruz and Cahuitán showed much less dramatic declines, because the time series began after the broader population decline had already begun to occur. Given the synchrony in inter-annual abundance fluctuations and historical reports of high abundance among these rookeries (Eckert 1993), we assumed that the abundance at Barra de la Cruz and Cahuitán was similar to that of other Mexican rookeries at the beginning of those time series, i.e., 1982 (L. Sarti Martínez pers. comm.). This allowed us to standardize trend and abundance estimates within the Mexican rookeries. &#160; &#160;</p>  <p>To apply Criterion A, three generations (or a minimum of ten years, whichever is longer) of abundance data are required (IUCN 2011). In the case of the Leatherback, we conservatively estimate its generation time as 30 years (see below). For Criterion A2, data from three generations ago (~100 yr) are necessary to estimate population declines beginning three generations ago up to the present (i.e. assessment) year. The challenges of this requirement on long-lived species like turtles—with generation lengths of 30 yr or more—are obvious (see Seminoff and Shanker 2008 for review). Abundance data from ~100 yr ago are not available for Leatherbacks anywhere in the world. Extrapolating backward using population trends based on current datasets was considered inappropriate&#160;because estimates produced would be biologically unrealistic and unsubstantiated, given what is currently known about sea turtle nesting densities on beaches and other factors (Mrosovsky 2003). In the absence of better information, we assumed that population abundance three generations (~100 years, one generation estimated 30 yr; see below) ago was similar to the first observed abundance rather than to assume that the population has always been in a decline (or increase) of the same magnitude as in the current generation (Table 2 in&#160;Supplementary Material). A similar approach was used in the Red List assessment of another long-lived, geographically widespread taxon, the African Elephant (Blanc 2008). Thus, to apply Criterion A to subpopulations (see separate subpopulation assessments) and the global population, we assumed that the abundance at the beginning of an available time series dataset had not changed significantly in the preceding three generations, and therefore used the same abundance value in trend calculations.<br/><br/>We also evaluated to the global population against Criterion A4 (Table 3 in&#160;Supplementary Material), using the same overall scheme as described above. Criterion A4 permits for analysis of population trend during a “moving window” of time, i.e. over three generations, but where the time window must include the past, present, and future. Furthermore, multiple time-frames are to be examined, and the maximum decline calculated for a given time-frame is to be compared to the thresholds (IUCN 2011). Therefore, we made the same assumption about earliest available historical abundance being equivalent to the population abundance for generations past, and estimated future population abundance in 2020, 2030, and 2040, which all fall within the next generation (i.e., 30 yr). These future projections assume that the derived population trend will continue without deviation during the next generation. Implicit in this assumption is that no changes to degree of threats or conservation efforts impacting rookeries, subpopulations, or the global population will occur during that time. Based on available information, threats to Leatherbacks globally that have caused observed declines have not ceased and are not reversible (see Wallace <em>et al</em>. 2011 and Eckert <em>et al</em>. 2012 for review), making this a reasonable assumption in the absence of better information. The global population will no longer be “Threatened” according to IUCN Red List thresholds by 2020 (-29.4% decline over three generations), and will be increasing by 2030 (3% increase) and beyond (104% increase by 2040)—i.e. IUCN category of Near Threatened or Least Concern—according to Criterion A4, depending on the “time window” applied (Table 3 in&#160;Supplementary Material). This result is due mainly to the currently large and growing Northwest Atlantic subpopulation, and in spite of the lack of sufficient information for the Southeast Atlantic subpopulation and the continued declines in the East Pacific and West Pacific subpopulations.<br/><br/><em>Estimating Generation Length:<br/><br/></em>Leatherback age at maturity is uncertain, and estimates range widely (see Jones <em>et al</em>. 2011 for review). Reported estimates fall between 9-15 yr, based on skeletochronology (Zug and Parham 1996), and inferences from mark-recapture studies (Dutton <em>et al</em>. 2005). Furthermore, updated skeletochronological analyses estimated Leatherback age at maturity to be between 26-32 yr (mean 29 yr) (Avens <em>et al</em>. 2009). Extrapolations of captive growth curves under controlled thermal and trophic conditions suggested that size at maturity could be reached in 7-16 yr (Jones <em>et al</em>. 2011). Thus, a high degree of variance and uncertainty remains about Leatherback age at maturity in the wild. Likewise, Leatherback lifespan is unknown. Long-term monitoring studies of Leatherback nesting populations have tracked individual adult females over multiple decades (e.g. Santidrián Tomillo&#160;<em>et al</em>. unpublished data, Nel and Hughes unpublished data), but precise estimates of reproductive lifespan and longevity for Leatherbacks are currently unavailable.<br/><br/>The IUCN Red List Criteria define generation length to be the average age of parents in a population; older than the age at maturity and younger than the oldest mature individual (IUCN 2011). Thus, for the purposes of this assessment, we estimated generation length to be 30 yr, or equal to the age at maturity (estimated to be 20 yr on average), plus a conservative estimate of reproductive half-life of 10 yr, as assumed by Spotila <em>et al</em>. (1996).<br/><br/><em>Sources of Uncertainty:<br/><br/></em>Although monitoring of nesting activities by adult female sea turtles is the most common metric recorded and reported across sites and species, globally, there are several disadvantages to using it as a proxy for overall population dynamics, some methodological, some interpretive (NRC 2010). First, because nesting females are a very small proportion of a sea turtle population, using abundance of nesting females and their activities as proxies for overall population abundance and trends requires knowledge of other key demographic parameters (several mentioned below) to allow proper interpretation of cryptic trends in nesting abundance (NRC 2010). However, there remains great uncertainty about most of these fundamental demographic parameters for Leatherbacks, including age at maturity (see Jones <em>et al</em>. 2011 for review), generation length, survivorship across life stages, adult and hatchling sex ratios, and conversion factors among reproductive parameters (e.g., clutch frequency, nesting success, re-migration intervals, etc.). These values can vary among subpopulations, further complicating the process of combining subpopulation abundance and trend estimates to obtain global population abundance and trend estimates, and contributing to the uncertainty in these estimates. Second, despite the prevalence of nesting abundance data for marine turtles, monitoring effort and methodologies can vary widely within and across study sites, complicating comparison of nesting count data across years within sites and across different sites as well as robust estimation of population size and trends (SWOT Scientific Advisory Board 2011). For example, monitoring effort on Matura beach, Trinidad, has changed multiple times since the early 1990s, which necessitated a modelling exercise to estimate a complete time series for years with reliable monitoring levels (Table 2 in&#160;Supplementary Material). Furthermore, there was a general lack of measures of variance around annual counts provided for the assessment, which could be erroneously interpreted as equally high confidence in all estimates. Measures of variance around annual counts would provide information about relative levels of monitoring effort within and among rookeries, and thus reliability of resulting estimates. For all of these reasons, results of this assessment of global population decline should be considered with caution. For further reading on sources of uncertainty in marine turtle Red List assessments, see Seminoff and Shanker (2008).</p>  <p></p>","<p><em>D. coriacea</em> is an oceanic, deep-diving marine turtle inhabiting tropical, subtropical, and subpolar seas. Leatherbacks make extensive migrations between different feeding areas at different seasons, and to and from nesting areas. Leatherbacks feed predominantly on jellyfishes, salps and siphonophores. Females usually produce several (3-10) clutches of 60-90 eggs in a reproductive season, and typically have a re-migration interval of multiple years (2+) between subsequent reproductive seasons. For a thorough review of Leatherback biology, please see Eckert <em>et al</em>. (2012).</p>  <p><br/></p>","<p>Threats to Leatherbacks vary in time and space, and in relative impact to populations. Threat categories affecting marine turtles, including Leatherbacks, were described by Wallace <em>et al</em>. (2011) as:</p>  <p>1) Fisheries bycatch: incidental capture of marine turtles in fishing gear targeting other species;</p>  <p>2) Take: direct utilization of turtles or eggs for human use (i.e. consumption, commercial products);</p>  <p>3) Coastal Development affecting critical turtle habitat: human-induced alteration of coastal environments due to construction, dredging, beach modification, etc.;</p>  <p>4) Pollution and Pathogens: marine pollution and debris that affect marine turtles (i.e. through ingestion or entanglement, disorientation caused by artificial lights), as well as impacts of pervasive pathogens (e.g. fibropapilloma virus) on turtle health;</p>  <p>5) Climate change: current and future impacts from climate change on marine turtles and their habitats (e.g. increasing sand temperatures on nesting beaches affecting hatchling sex ratios, sea level rise, storm frequency and intensity affecting nesting habitats, etc.).</p>  <p>	The relative impacts of individual threats to all Leatherback subpopulations were assessed by Wallace <em>et al</em>. (2011). Fisheries bycatch was classified as the highest threat to Leatherbacks globally, followed by human consumption of Leatherback eggs, meat, or other products, and coastal development. Due to lack of information, pollution and pathogens was only scored as affecting three subpopulations and climate change was only scored for two subpopulations. Enhanced efforts to assess and reduce the impacts of these threats on Leatherbacks—and other marine turtle species—should be a high priority for future conservation efforts.&#160;</p>","<p>Leatherbacks are a single species globally comprising seven biologically described regional management units (RMUs; Wallace <em>et al</em>. 2010), which describe biologically and geographically explicit population segments by integrating information from nesting sites, mitochondrial and nuclear DNA studies, movements and habitat use by all life stages. RMUs are functionally equivalent to IUCN subpopulations, thus providing the appropriate demographic unit for Red List assessments. There are seven Leatherback RMUs (hereafter subpopulations): Northwest Atlantic Ocean, Southeast Atlantic Ocean, Southwest Atlantic Ocean, Northeast Indian Ocean, Southwest Indian Ocean, East Pacific Ocean, and West Pacific Ocean (Figure 2 in&#160;Supplementary Material). Multiple genetic stocks have been defined according to geographically disparate nesting areas around the world (Dutton<em> et al</em>. 1999, 2013), and are included within RMU delineations (Wallace<em> et al</em>. 2010; shapefiles can be viewed and downloaded at: <a href=""http://seamap.env.duke.edu/swot"">http://seamap.env.duke.edu/swot</a>).</p>",Decreasing,"<p>Leatherbacks are distributed circumglobally, with nesting sites on tropical sandy beaches and foraging ranges that extend into temperate and sub-polar latitudes (see Figure 1 in&#160;Supplementary Material&#160;and global distribution map). See Eckert <em>et al</em>. (2012) for review of Leatherback geographic range.&#160;<strong></strong></p>","Leatherback eggs and animals are taken for human use (i.e. consumption and commercial products), eggs are also eaten by domestic animals (e.g. dogs).",Terrestrial|Marine,"<p>Leatherbacks are protected under various Conventions, national and international laws, treaties, agreements, and memoranda of understanding. A partial list of international conservation instruments that provide legislative protection for Leatherbacks are: Annex II of the SPAW Protocol to the Cartagena Convention (a protocol concerning specially protected areas and wildlife); the Leatherback’s inclusion in Appendix I of CITES (Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora); and Appendices I and II of the Convention on Migratory Species (CMS); the Inter-American Convention for the Protection and Conservation of Sea Turtles (IAC); the Memorandum of Understanding on the Conservation and Management of Marine Turtles and their Habitats of the Indian Ocean and South-East Asia (IOSEA); the Memorandum of Understanding on ASEAN Sea Turtle Conservation and Protection; and the Memorandum of Understanding Concerning Conservation Measures for Marine Turtles of the Atlantic Coast of Africa.</p>  <p>Long-term efforts to reduce or eliminate threats to Leatherbacks on nesting beaches have been successful in many places (e.g. Dutton <em>et al</em>. 2005, Chacón-Chaverri and Eckert 2007, Santidrián Tomillo <em>et al</em>. 2007, Sarti Martínez<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2007) but not all places (e.g. Chan and Liew 1996). Reducing Leatherback bycatch has become a primary focus for many conservation projects around the world, and some mitigation efforts are showing promise (Watson <em>et al</em>. 2005; Gilman <em>et al</em>. 2006, 2011). However, threats to Leatherbacks—bycatch mortality and egg consumption, in particular—persist, and in some places, continue to hinder population recovery (Alfaro-Shigueto <em>et al</em>. 2011, 2012; Tapilatu <em>et al</em>. 2013; Wallace <em>et al.</em> 2013). For depleted Leatherback populations to recover, the most prevalent and impactful threats must be reduced wherever they occur, whether on nesting beaches or in feeding, migratory, or other habitats (Bellagio Report 2007; Wallace <em>et al</em>. 2011, 2013); a holistic approach that addresses threats at all life history stages needs to be implemented (Dutton and Squires 2011). Therefore, current conservation efforts, legal protections, and resources supporting those mechanisms must be maintained—and augmented, wherever possible—to reverse population declines and sustain stable and increasing population trends among Leatherback subpopulations. Regional and local efforts to protect Leatherbacks, their offspring, and their habitats should be designed to address threats at appropriate scales, and implemented with participation of appropriate stakeholders.</p>",Afrotropical|Australasian|Indomalayan|Nearctic|Neotropical|Oceanian|Palearctic,,false,false,Global
45224953,3590,Callorhinus ursinus,Vulnerable,A2b,2015,2015-03-26 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The global population of Northern Fur Seals includes breeding areas extending from the Kuril Islands of Russia, across the Bering Sea, south to the west coast of the United States with the southernmost rookery in the Channel Islands of California. The population has shown inconsistent trends at particular areas with the most dramatic change occurring at the largest breeding rookery, St. Paul Island, Pribilof Islands, Alaska. The Pribilof population has experienced a significant, steep decline in recent years and has failed to recover despite the cessation of commercial harvesting. Although the global population is still in excess of a million animals, the current downward trends in abundance at St. Paul and nearby St. George Island remain unexplained. The Pribilof Islands population represents just under one half of the world-wide population and has declined by approximately 66% over the last three generations (1972–2014). The global change in abundance during that same period was 30.1% (95% CI -47.1% to 14.5%). Therefore, Northern Fur Seals should remain in the IUCN Red List category of Vulnerable under criterion A2b (due to the fact that the causes of the reduction do not appear to have ceased, are not understood, and may not be reversible based on the unknown cause, and that an index of abundance appropriate to the taxon (direct counting and mark-recapture) was used to assess population size).","Northern Fur Seals exhibit extreme sexual dimorphism, with adult males measuring 30-40% longer and more than 4.5 times heavier than adult females. Males can be as large as 2.1 m and 270 kg. Adult females can measure 1.5 m and 50 kg or more. Newborns weigh 5.4-6 kg, and are 60-65 cm long. Pups are blackish at birth, with variable oval areas of buff color on the sides, in the axillary area, and on the chin and sides of the muzzle. After three to four months, pups moult to the colour of adult females and subadults. Northern Fur Seals become sexually mature at three to five years old, at which time females can produce one pup each year for most of the rest of their lives (Scheffer and Wilke 1953,&#160;Scheffer 1962). Kuzin (1999) noted that at times of rapid population growth on Tuleny Island, some females were fertilized as early as age two with five year old females achieving a pregnancy rate of 80%. Gestation lasts 51 weeks, which includes a delay of implantation of 3.5-4.0 months (York and Scheffer 1997). Females may produce pups up to age 23 (Lander 1981). Males do not become physically mature, and large enough to compete for a territory that will be used by females, until they are eight to nine years old. The generation time for females is approximately 12-15 years depending on the determination methods used. Pacifici <em>et al.</em> (2013) estimated the generation time at 14.1 years.<br/><br/>Breeding on the Pribilof Islands occurs from mid-June through August, with a peak in early July (the median date in southern California is approximately two weeks earlier than at the Pribilofs). This is a highly polygynous species. Males arrive at the rookeries up to one month before females and vocalize, display, and fight to establish and maintain territories.<br/><br/>Northern Fur Seals usually give birth a day after arrival at the rookery. Mean time from birth to estrous is 5.3 days, followed by a departure for a mean of 8.3 days for the first feeding trip. Females breeding at the Pribilof Islands of Alaska are located relatively far from the foraging areas, which are concentrated at the edge of the continental shelf and hence females in this population consistently make longer foraging trips than most other female otariids, with a mean trip length of 6.9 days. Once foraging begins the mean depth of dives is 68 m and average duration is 2.2 minutes with maximum depth recorded of 207 m and maximum duration of 7.6 minutes. Pups are visited eight to 12 times over the lactation period and attended for a mean of 2.1 days during each visit, before being abruptly weaned at four months old.<br/><br/>Northern Fur Seals are one of the most pelagic pinnipeds. They spend most of the year at sea, and rarely (if ever) returning to land between one breeding season and the next. Thus, males spend an average of only 45 days ashore a year and females only 35 days a year. Once weaned, juveniles go to sea and do not haul out until they return, usually to the island of their birth, two to three years later. At sea, Northern Fur Seals are most likely to be encountered alone or in pairs, with groups of three or more being uncommon. They forage relatively far from shore, over the edge of the continental shelf and slope. Diving is concentrated around dawn and dusk. Northern Fur Seals spend quite a bit of time rafting at the surface, either asleep or grooming. Many animals, especially juveniles, migrate from the Bering Sea south to California or the waters off Japan, to spend the winter feeding. (Sterling <em>et al.</em> 2014).<br/><br/>The Northern Fur Seal diet varies by site, oceanic domain and season and includes many varieties of epipelagic and vertically-migrating mesopelagic schooling and non-schooling fish and squid. Prey species of importance in the waters off California and Washington include Anchovy, Hake, Saury, Salmon, and several species of Squid and Rockfish. On the Pribilof Islands, prey species reflect foraging patterns on and off the continental shelf. Satellite telemetry and stable isotope analysis indicate that those seals foraging on the shelf use typical on-shelf species like Walleye Pollock, Pacific Herring and gadid species while off shelf foragers included species such as myctophids. Bogoslof Island in the Aleutian Islands of Alaska is a volcanic island surrounded by deep water and the most common prey species there included Northern Smoothtongue and gonatid squid species (Zeppelin and Orr 2010).<br/><br/>Predators include Killer Whales, Sharks and Steller Sea Lions (Gentry 1998).","Northern Fur Seals have one of the longest and most complex histories of commercial harvesting, which began when the main breeding colonies were discovered in the late 18th century; exploitation continued through until 1984. Numerous international treaties and agreements were put in force over time in efforts to manage this species, and they are no longer harvested commercially. Small numbers are taken annually by Alaska Natives in a subsistence harvest on the Pribilof Islands. Harvest levels are declining and are unlikely to be affecting the status of the Fur Seal population.<br/><br/>Northern Fur Seals compete for Walleye Pollock with one of the largest commercial fisheries world. Measurable annual mortality, especially for juveniles and subadults, is caused by entanglements in derelict and discarded fishing gear, marine debris and direct interactions with commercial fisheries. This mortality was highest during the period of active high seas drift net fishing in the North Pacific in the 1980s, but entanglement in debris is an ongoing problem. Long-term ecosystem regime change in the North Pacific and possible changes in the foraging patterns of a key predator (the Killer Whale), may be working synergistically with the fisheries related issues to cause the current population decline.<br/><br/>Like all fur seals, Northern Fur Seals are vulnerable to oil spills because of their dependence on their thick pelage for thermoregulation. The small colonies at San Miguel Island in the California Channel Islands and on the Farallon Island may be at greatest risk due to proximity to major harbours, shipping lanes and offshore oil extraction facilities.<br/><br/>The effect of global climate change on Northern Fur Seals is uncertain. However, any further negative disruption of their ecosystem should be considered a threat.","The population history for Northern Fur Seals throughout the North Pacific and Bering Seas has been tied to the harvest of seals for their pelts (Kuzin 1999, NMFS 2007). Between the mid 1700s and early 1800s, Russian sealers used Aleut labour to harvest an average of 100,000 Fur Seals, mostly pups, annually in Alaskan waters (Roppel 1984). The commercial harvest of Fur Seals on the Pribilof Islands continued with periodic modifications to the sex/age classes of focus until and after the United States purchase of Alaska in 1867. In the late 1800s and early 1900s commercial harvests on land and pelagic sealing continued unregulated until the Fur Seal act of 1911 was signed by Japan, Russia, Great Britain (for Canada) and the United States. This treaty prohibited pelagic sealing and reduced the take on land which at its peak in 1868 had harvested 240,000 seals in a single year (Roppel and Davey 1965, NMFS 2007).<br/><br/>In the early 1900s the Pribilof stock continued to grow in abundance despite commercial harvest. Between 40,000 and 126,000 seals were harvested each year during 1943-1968 (NMFS 2007). A new harvest regime was followed in the early 1960s which allowed for annual harvests of approximately 300,000 adult females and 30,000-96,000 subadult males (York and Hartley 1981). The population did not increase as anticipated after this new regime and ultimately commercial harvest of Fur Seals was terminated on St. George Island in 1973 and on St. Paul Island in 1983. Subsistence harvest of subadult males has continued on both islands since that time (NMFS 2007). In 2014, subsistence harvest rules were changed to allow the annual take of up to 150 male pups on St. George Island during a new autumn harvest season. This harvest occurred for the first time in the autumn of 2014.<br/><br/>Contrasting to the Northern Fur Seal abundance trend on the Pribilof Islands is Bogoslof Island, a small volcanic island in the eastern Aleutian Islands of Alaska. Northern Fur Seals were first reported on Bogoslof in 1976 with the first breeding seals noted in 1980 (Lloyd <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1981, Loughlin and Miller 1989). Subsequent surveys revealed an exponential growth rate during the 1990s and early 2000s with the estimated number of pups increasing at a rate of 48.5% annually between the time pups were first observed in 1980 and 2005. This rate then dropped to approximately 10% annually between 2005-2011, the last time the island was surveyed. Such a dramatic growth rate can only be explained by a combination of recruitment and immigration from other sites (Ream <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1999). Recent studies suggest that the recent slowing in growth rate coupled with increases in foraging trip duration and distance may represent a typical density dependent response to a limited resource (Kuhn <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2014). The Northern Fur Seal population on Bogoslof has increased to the point that it is the second largest Northern Fur Seal rookery in the United States, surpassing St. George Island. This growth has served to ameliorate the overall decline of the population.<br/><br/>Northern Fur Seal rookeries in Russia have not been counted since 2006-2009 depending on the site. However, basic trends until that time are documented. Overharvesting in the 19th century eradicated the population on the Kuril Islands where Northern Fur Seals were considered extinct until the mid 1950s. Pup production grew rapidly on the Kurils during 1962-1977 (19.9% annual increase). The population stabilized around 1978 and trend became slightly negative (-0.8%) during 1978-1988. Pup production in the Kuril Islands has increased 82.4% since 1988 (+3.8% annually) and is now comparable to the Tuleny (Robben) Island population. During the last count in 2006, approximately 27,090 pups were counted. Total abundance of Fur Seals in the Kuril Islands currently exceeds 100,000 individuals (Kuzin 1999).<br/><br/>In 1999, A. Kuzin published a detailed description of the biology and history of Northern Fur Seals in Russia with special emphasis on Tuleny Island. He reported that the population at Tuleny at the time of its discovery in 1852 was approximately 120,000. Subsequent unregulated harvest reduced the population to as low as a few thousand animals in the late 1890s. Tuleny Island then underwent a series of population highs and low during various periods of harvest. The maximum population was approximately 180,000 individuals in the late 1960s (Kuzin 1999). The most recent estimate was 140,000 individuals including 42,200 pups in 2009 (Kuzin 2010).<br/><br/>The San Miguel stock of Northern Fur Seals breeds primarily on San Miguel Island, California, at the southern extent of the breeding range. This population has increased or been stable since its discovery in 1968 (Caretta <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2013). The trend in pup births includes a steady increase followed by a sharp decline that has been shown to be directly tied to El Niño events; pup production in 1997-1998 declined 81% due to the redistribution of prey caused by the event. Overwinter satellite telemetry studies have shown that Northern Fur Seals from all of the US breeding sites use similar foraging grounds along the west coast of Southeast Alaska, British Columbia, Washington and Oregon (Lea <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2009, Ream <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2005, Sterling and Ream 2004). The overlap is not limited to foraging habitat as genetic studies indicate that there is very little differentiation between animals throughout the range (Dickerson <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2010).<br/><br/>Population estimates for Northern Fur Seals are generally derived by multiplying pup counts by a correction factor of 4.4747 to include all non-pups. A global abundance estimate was generated from the most recently available count and estimate data for all subpopulations in the range using the agTrend model (Johnson and Fritz 2014). The 2014 estimate for localities other than the Pribilofs is a projected number based on the trends at each site. The modelled population estimate used all of the data available since 1966 to project the estimates reported above. The most recent actual count and estimated numbers used in the model are shown below.<br/><br/>Pribilof Islands, 2014<br/><br/>St. Paul Island: 91,737 pups x 4.4747 = 410,496 (Towell <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2014)<br/><br/>St. George Island: 18,937 pups x 4.474 = 84,737 (Towell <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2014)<br/><br/>Sea Lion Rock: 5,250 pups x 4.4747 = 23,492 (Towell <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2014)<br/><br/>Commander Islands, 2006: 59,805 x 4.4747 = 267,609 (Burkanov and Calkins 2007)<br/><br/>Tuleny Island, 2009: 42,200 x 4.4747 = 188,832 (Kuzin 2010)<br/><br/>Kuril Islands, 2006: 25,164 pups x 4.4747 = 112,601(Burkanov <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2007)<br/><br/>Bogoslof Island, 2011: 22,905 pups x 4.4747 = 102,493 (Towell <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2012)<br/><br/>San Miguel Island, 2014 (not including Castle Rock): 2,327 x 4.4747 = 10,412 (A.

Berger, Point Blue Conservation Science pers. comm.)<br/><br/>The global population of Northern Fur Seals is estimated to be approximately 1.29 million in 2014, a decline of approximately 658,000 since 1976. Note that this number is different than the sum of abundances given above because most were projected forward to 2014 in the model. Using the agTrend model to project the population reduction at all sites over the past three generations (1972-2014) gives an estimated reduction of 30.1% (95% CI -47.1% to 14.5%). Annual abundance estimates for the entire range do not exist as there are no consistent monitoring strategies in place. Although abundance is declining, the overall decline is not proportional across all sites. The greatest decreases are occurring in the Pribilof Islands, while populations in the Kuril Islands and Tuleny Island in Russia, and on Bogoslof Island in Alaska have increased.<br/><br/>The decline described above understates the total reduction of the Northern Fur Seal population in historic times. It is estimated that the population numbered up to 2.5 million animals in the 1950s, and it may have been considerably larger than that when there were many more active rookeries before the onset of human exploitation.<br/><br/>To date the only population viability analysis conducted for Northern Fur Seals was described in a report from the Canadian Science Advisory Secretariat, Department of Fisheries and Oceans, Canada (Olesiuk 2012). This analysis concluded that all subpopulations are presently secure with little risk (0.00%-0.42%) of extirpation within the next century.",Decreasing,"Northern Fur Seals are a widely-distributed pelagic species in the waters of the North Pacific Ocean and the adjacent Bering Sea, Sea of Okhotsk and Sea of Japan. They range from northern Baja California, Mexico, north and offshore across the North Pacific to northern Honshu, Japan. The southern limit of their distribution at sea is approximately 35°N (Rice 1998). Vagrants reach the Yellow Sea in the west and eastern Beaufort Sea to the north. They breed on rookeries in Russia (Kuril Islands, Commander Islands and Tuleny Island (Kuzin 1999), Alaska (Pribilof Islands and Bogoslof Island) and California (San Miguel Island) (Loughlin <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 1994). In the past, the vast majority of the population bred at rookeries on the Pribilof Islands, with substantial numbers on the Commander Islands. However, a significant population decline on the Pribilofs concurrent with the establishment of a new breeding site in the eastern Aleutian Islands and population increases in the Kuril Islands of Russia has resulted in the Pribilof Islands now representing approximately 45% of the global population.","Northern Fur Seals have a long and complex history of commercial harvesting, which began when the main breeding colonies were discovered in the late 18th century. Commercial exploitation continued through 1984, and there were many periods of decline and recovery over this long period. Numerous international treaties and agreements were put in force in efforts to manage harvests. There is currently no commercial harvesting.<br/><br/>Small numbers of Northern Fur Seals are taken annually by Alaska Natives in a subsistence harvest on the Pribilof Islands. For the period 1999-2014, the average annual harvest on St. Paul Island was 463 subadult males/year. Subsistence harvest has declined in recent years such that the harvest has not exceeded 400 since 2005 on St. Paul. On St. George Island an average of 218 males were taken annually between 1985 and 2012 (Angliss and Allen 2009, Allen and Angliss 2014).",Terrestrial|Marine,"Following the termination of the Interim Convention on the Conservation of the North Pacific Fur Seal in 1984, the Northern Fur Seal is now managed on land independently by the Russian Commonwealth of Independent States and the United States.

45225428,8010,Erignathus barbatus,Least Concern,,2016,2016-02-17 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"Due to its large population size, broad distribution, variable feeding habits, and no evidence of a current decline, the Bearded Seal are classified as Least Concern. However, Bearded Seals are very likely going to be negatively impacted by climate change, in particular because of losses of sea ice, and they should be monitored over the coming decades and reassessed as soon as more data become available.","<p>Bearded Seals are the largest northern phocid seal. Burns (1981) found that the average standard length of adults measured from the Bering/Chukchi region was 233 cm, with females slightly longer and substantially heavier than males. Maximum lengths were 233 cm for males and 243 cm for females and maximum weights were 262 kg and 360 kg. Newborn pups averaged 131 cm in length. Quakenbush <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> (2011) found an average asymptotic length of 219 cm for Bering/Chukchi samples from the 1970s, and 209 cm for samples from the 2000s. Cameron <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> (2010) report a maximum weight of 432 kg for a female collected in the Bering Sea in spring 1985. The Atlantic Bearded Seal is of similar size, and shares the slight sexual dimorphism, with females tending to be larger than males (Andersen <em>et al</em>. 1999, Kovacs and Lydersen 2006). Maximum mass recorded in Svalbard is for a female in spring that weighed 424 kg <br/> <br/> In Alaskan waters, sexual maturity is reached between 3 and 6 years in females, with an average of 4 years (Quakenbush <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2011). Males reach sexual maturity at 6-7 years (Burns 1981). In Svalbard, females reach sexual maturity at an age of 5 years, while males are 6 years of age when they are sexually mature though it is likely some years from that point before they compete successfully to breed (Andersen <em>et al</em>. 1999). Final body size in Bearded Seals is reached at approximately 9-10 years (McLaren 1958). Maximum longevity is likely 25-30 years (Cameron <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2010).</p><p>Bearded Seal pups are normally born on pack ice or small floes of annually-formed sea ice that fracture away from shore-fast ice as it breaks up in late spring (Kovacs <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 1996, Kovacs and Lydersen 2006). They also have been documented to use glacier ice pieces floating on the sea for birthing and nursing when forced to by the lack of availability of first-year sea ice (Lydersen <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2014). The large, precocial pups swim within hours of birth (Kovacs 2009). Peak birthing occurs between late March and mid-May, varying somewhat across the Bearded Seal’s range (Burns 1981, Kovacs 2009). Gjertz <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> (2000) estimated that in Svalbard pups are weaned in approximately 24 days. Nursing might be somewhat shorter for the Pacific subspecies, Burns (1981) suggested that pups are weaned at 12-18 days of age. Prior to weaning, their aquatic skills develop to the degree that they spend about half their time in the water, diving for up to 5.5 minutes to depths of up to 84 m (Lydersen <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 1994). Mothers spend over 80% of their time in the water while caring for a dependent pup (Lydersen and Kovacs 1999); about half that time is spent away from the neonate, presumably in foraging dives. Females haul-out to nurse their pups on average three times a day. The small amount of time mothers spend out of the water when pups are young is thought to be an adaptive response to Polar Bear predation; when only the pup is on the surface, the pair is less conspicuous to hunting bears (Krafft <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2000). Mating takes place at the end of lactation similar to other phocid seals. Males court females and display using elaborate downward trilling vocalizations that can travel many kilometres (Cleator <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 1989). Individual males use distinct songs, and occupy the same territories over a series of consecutive years within constraints imposed by variable ice conditions, or they show a roaming pattern (Van Parijs <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2001, 2003, 2004). Males exhibit aggression with each other during breeding, including bubble-blowing and physical combat so the mating system is presumably polygynous to some degree.<br/><br/>Bearded seals have an extended moulting period and animals can be found shedding hair from April to August, though there appears to be a peak in May/June for both subspecies (Burns 1981, Gjertz <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2000).&#160; During the moult they spend much of their time hauled out and are reluctant to enter the water (Kovacs and Lydersen 2006). Bearded seals use sea ice as a haulout platform on a year-round basis whenever it is available, preferring small and medium sized floes and generally avoiding large floes (Simpkins <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2003). However, they will haul out on land in the summer in the absence of sea ice (e.g., Burns 1981, Merkel <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2013).&#160; They are rarely found more than a body length from access to water even if hauled out on land (Kovacs 2009).<br/><br/>Bearded Seals naturally occur at quite low densities (Bengtson <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2005); they are typically solitary animals, but they do form small, loose aggregations at times (Burns 1981). <br/><br/>Studies conducted on Atlantic Bearded Seal lactating females and pups (Gjertz <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2000, Krafft <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2000) have shown that diving depths largely reflect local bathymetry in coastal areas.&#160; This reflects their benthic foraging habits; Bearded Seals feed primarily on or near the bottom and most diving is to depths of less than 100 m (though dives of adults have been recorded up to 300 m and young-of-the-year have been recorded diving down to almost 500 m; Gjertz <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2000). They use their elaborate whiskers to search for food items on and in soft bottom substrates and have powerful suction abilities to extract prey (Marshall <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2006, 2008). The diet of Bearded Seals varies by age, location, and season (Lowry <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 1980). Polar Cod (<em>Boreogadis saida</em>), Sculpins, Spider Crab, and Shrimps (<em>Sabinea sptemcarinatus </em>and <em>Sclerocrangon boreas</em>) are the most frequent prey items in Svalbard (Hjelset <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 1999). However, Cod, other demersal fish, and worms are also regular components of the diet in this area. A wide variety of prey has been reported from the Okhotsk Sea, with Crabs, Shrimps, Clams, Snails, and Worms accounting for most of their diet (Burns 1981). Quakenbush <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> (2011) analyzed the frequency of occurrence of prey in 943 Bearded Seal stomachs collected from the Bering and Chukchi Seas during 1960-2009 and identified 213 different prey taxa. The most commonly eaten groups were Crabs, Shrimps, Clams, Snails, benthic and demersal fishes, and echiuroid worms. These authors found a significant increase in consumption of gadid fishes, principally Arctic Cod (<em>Boreogadus saida</em>) and Saffron Cod (<em>Eleginus gracilis</em>), from the 1960s to the 2000s.</p><p>Bearded Seals are preyed upon by Polar Bears, Killer Whales, Greenland Sharks, and Pacific Walruses (Lowry and Fay 1984, Lowry <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 1987, Kovacs and Lydersen 2006).</p>","Global climate warming is currently causing major reductions in the extent and duration of sea ice cover in the Arctic, creating a threat to many species of ice-associated marine mammals. Pinnipeds such as the Bearded Seal that are dependent on sea ice for pupping, moulting, resting, and access to foraging areas, may be especially vulnerable to such changes (Laidre <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2008, 2015; Kovacs 2011, 2012). In 2012, Bearded Seals were listed under the US Endangered Species Act following a detailed review of their status and threats (Cameron <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2010) because of the threats posed from climate change induced losses in sea ice and ocean acidification due to climate warming, as well as increasing industrial activities in a more ice-free Arctic (Federal Register 2012). Increasing development and industrialization of the Arctic may threaten Bearded Seals in several ways. Oil spills from offshore extraction and transportation could negatively affect them through direct contact with oil and damage to foraging areas and stocks of prey, particularly benthic invertebrates, that are vulnerable to oil contamination. An increase in human-created noise in the arctic environment could cause marine mammals, including Bearded Seals that are very vocal during their breeding season, to abandon areas of habitat they otherwise might use. Increased shipping will pose a greater threat of marine accidents and disturbance of marine mammals. Cameron <em><em>et al.</em></em> (2010) concluded that these factors could constitute low to moderate threats to Bearded Seals.<br/><br/>Hunting by indigenous peoples continues throughout most of the species range. There is no evidence of any impact from hunting on Bearded Seal population numbers. For example, reports from Alaska Native subsistence hunters do not give any indication that Bearded Seal numbers have declined (Quakenbush <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2011).","Population sizes and trends are unknown for all populations of the Atlantic Bearded Seal (see Laidre <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2015 for a summary). An estimate for Canadian waters of 190,000 animals was suggested by Cleator (1996), based on data collected over a 35-year period, but this number is really an educated guess as opposed to an actual estimate and in any case is now dated. The Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada more recently assessed the status of this species in Canada as being data deficient (COSEWIC 2007). They are also listed on Greenland’s Red List as being data deficient (Boertmann 2007). There have never been any surveys for Bearded Seals in Norwegian waters (Kovacs and Lydersen 2006) or Russian territories in the Atlantic Arctic (Reijnders <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 1993). However, recordings of their distinctive breeding calls via passive acoustic monitoring networks suggest that this species remains widespread and relatively numerous in the Atlantic Arctic (e.g., Moore <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2012).<br/><br/>Population data are also incomplete for Pacific Bearded Seals, but this subspecies has received considerably more survey effort. Cameron <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> (2010) concluded that the best estimate for the Okhotsk Sea is 95,000 based on data from 1990 (Fedoseev 2000), and that there are no useful abundance estimates for the East Siberian and Beaufort Seas. Aerial surveys in 1999-2000 estimated about 27,000 Bearded Seals in the Alaskan Chukchi Sea. In the Bering Sea, surveys having been conducted by the USA and the Soviet Union/Russia starting in the 1970s. Early efforts, which covered varying areas and used a variety of methods, suggested an abundance of 50,000-100,000 Bearded Seals in the region. More recently, Ver Hoef <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> (2014) analyzed line transect survey data collected in the Bering Sea in spring 2007 using a series of models and estimated there were 61,800 Bearded Seals (95% CI 34,900–171,600) in their study area. Because that study included about half of the available sea ice habitat, Cameron <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> (2010) considered that the total Bearded Seal population in the Bering Sea was about 125,000. It is likely that the total abundance of Pacific Bearded Seals, including the Okhotsk Sea, is at least 250,000.<br/><br/>The global population size of Bearded Seals is unknown. Current population trends are also unknown.",Unknown,"Bearded Seals have a patchy circumpolar distribution throughout much of the Arctic and sub-Arctic, south of 85ºN.&#160;In the Pacific sector they range from the Arctic Ocean south through the East Siberian, Beaufort, Chukchi, and Bering Seas (Burns 1981).&#160;They also occupy all of Hudson Bay and much of the eastern Canadian Archipelago south to southern Labrador, and both coasts of Greenland. They occur along the north shore of Iceland, within the Svalbard Archipelago, in the drifting pack ice of the Barents Sea and across much of the north coast of the Russian Federation (Kovacs 2009). Bearded Seal vagrants have been reported from many locations outside the Arctic including Portugal (van Bree 2000), the Gulf of Saint Lawrence, northern Newfoundland, and Massachusetts&#160;(Gosselin and Boily 1994)&#160;in the North Atlantic, as well as in Japan and China in the North Pacific (Rice 1998).<br/> <br/> Bearded Seals are strongly associated with sea ice and are benthic feeders, and these two attributes explain much of their seasonal movement patterns and their general distribution. While they are not strictly migratory, Bearded Seals in the Bering-Chukchi region undergo seasonal movements linked with the advance and retreat of sea ice (Burns 1981, Cameron <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2010). However, in some other regions they are quite sedentary throughout the year, such as in Svalbard, Norway (Kovacs and Lydersen 2006).","<p></p><p>Indigenous peoples of the Arctic have hunted Bearded Seals for subsistence for thousands of years, a practice that continues today throughout much of the species’ range. However, levels of subsistence harvest are not well known. Subsistence harvests of Bearded Seals in Alaska were estimated to average approximately 6,800/year during 1990-1998 (Allen and Angliss 2010). Some animals are struck and lost, especially from late spring to mid summer when they are thinnest, and if those animals are accounted for the annual Alaska harvest could be as high as 10,000. An additional 1,000-2,000 may be taken by coastal hunters in Chukotka (Cameron <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2010). Subsistence harvest levels are not closely monitored in Canada, but Cleator (1996) estimated that roughly 2,400 Bearded Seals were taken per year. In Greenland Bearded Seals make up only 1-2% of the Seal catch (Garde 2013), with some few hundred taken annually. Bearded Seals are hunted at low levels in Svalbard currently, but during the whaling period individual boats would take hundreds. They are also harvested in the White Sea.<br/> <br/> The former Soviet Union historically conducted ship-based commercial harvests of Bearded Seals in the North Pacific region, in the Bering, Chukchi, and Okhotsk Seas. Harvests grew from 9,000 to 13,000 for the Bering and Okhotsk seas combined during 1957-1964, and were 8,000 to 10,000 per year during 1964-1967 (Reeves <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1992). Ship-based harvests were suspended from 1970 to 1975, and took place at lower levels when they resumed (Kelly 1988). There is currently no significant commercial harvest of Bearded Seals in Russia.</p>",Terrestrial|Marine,"Within the USA, the Marine Mammal Protection Act generally prohibits taking of Bearded Seals unless it is by an Alaska Native for subsistence or production of handicrafts. In 2012, Bearded Seals in the Bering-Chukchi and Okhotsk Seas were listed as threatened under the US Endangered Species Act (Federal Register 2012). In Canada, subsistence hunting of Bearded Seals is co-managed by the Department of Fisheries and Oceans and regional resource boards (Cameron <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2010). Licensed hunters can shoot Bearded Seals in Svalbard, outside protected areas and during open seasons, that are set in periods when Bearded Seals shot in the water are least likely to sink (Kovacs and Lydersen 2006). In Russia, the “Law of Fisheries and Preservation of Aquatic Resources” provides for subsistence harvest of Seals by aboriginal Russian peoples, and a total allowable catch is determined annually. Russia is the only nation to set a quota on the number of Bearded Seals that can be harvested, it is an “open” hunt in all other regions.<br/><br/>Bearded Seals are able to use glacier ice pieces that have calved into the sea as haul-out platforms, so tidal glacier fronts are increasingly important to them in areas where sea ice declines are marked (Lydersen <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2014). Tidal glacier fjords may represent important breeding refugias in the future as sea ice continues to decline and this habitat type should be considered for special conservation status.",Nearctic|Palearctic,,false,false,Global
45225749,8239,Eumetopias jubatus,Near Threatened,,2016,2016-02-04 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The Steller Sea Lion includes two recognized subspecies, the Western Steller Sea Lion and the Loughlin’s Steller Sea Lion. Western Steller Sea Lions experienced a dramatic and unexplained population decline of about 70% between the late 1970s and 1990. The population reached its low point in approximately 2000, and through 2015 has shown an overall annual increase of 1.8% per year in the USA. However, in the western Aleutian Islands Sea Lion numbers have continued to decline. Overall, the western subspecies had experienced a population reduction of approximately 50% during the last three generations and continues to meet IUCN criteria for Endangered. The Loughlin’s Steller Sea Lion population has increased steadily since 1979, and is projected to be 243% larger in 2015 than in 1985. That subspecies does not meet any of the criteria for IUCN threatened categories.<br/><br/>When the two subspecies are considered together, the large increase displayed by Loughlin’s Steller Sea Lion is enough to compensate for much of the decline elsewhere, such that the overall abundance of the species has declined by approximately 13% over the last three generations. This does not meet any of the criteria for IUCN threatened categories. However, because of the slower recovery of Western Steller Sea Lions and a continuing decline in a portion of their range, it is recommended that as a species, Steller Sea Lions should continue to be listed as Near Threatened as they almost qualify for a threatened listing under criterion A2a.","Steller Sea Lions are the largest otariids and the fourth largest pinniped. Both sexes are robust and powerfully built. They are sexually dimorphic, with adult males weighing three times as much as, and growing 20–25% longer than, adult females. Pups are born with a thick blackish-brown lanugo that is molted by about six months of age. The maximum length of adult males is about 3.3 m and average weight is 1,000 kg. The maximum length for adult females is about 2.5 m and average weight is 273 kg. Pups are born at an average size of about 1 m and 18–22 kg (Loughlin 2009).<br/><br/>The age of sexual maturity is 3–6 years for females, and 3–7 years for males (Calkins and Pitcher 1982). Males are not able to defend territories before they are nine years old. The annual pregnancy rate of mature females in the western population declined during the 1970s and 1980s and was estimated to be 55% in the 1980s based on collections at sea (Pitcher <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 1998). Age-structured modelling based on population counts from the central Gulf of Alaska indicates that the birth rate in 2004 was 36% lower than in the 1970s (Holmes <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2007). Gestation lasts one year, including a delay of implantation of about three months. Females may live to be up to 30 years old and males to about 20 years (Loughlin 2009). Here we use a generation time of 10 years based on life tables derived from collections made in the 1970s and 1980s (Calkins and Pitcher 1982), and other analyses (York 1994, Holmes and York 2003, Van de Kerk <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2013).<br/><br/>Steller Sea Lions are highly polygynous and breed in the late spring and summer. Adult males arrive before females and those that are nine years or older establish themselves on territories, which they aggressively defend. Pups are born from May through July, and females stay continuously ashore with their newborns for the first 7–10 days after giving birth. Following this period of attendance, females make foraging excursions for periods of 18–25 hours, followed by time ashore to nurse their pup. Females come into oestrus and mate about two weeks after giving birth. Weaning can occur before the next breeding season, but it is not unusual to see females nursing yearlings or older juveniles (Loughlin 2009). Recent work on vital rates indicates that age specific survival may differ across the range and second year survival is likely dependent on the age at weaning (Hastings <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2011, Fritz <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2014, Altukhov <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2015, Maniscalco <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2015).<br/><br/>Steller Sea Lions are primarily found from the coast, where they haul out on rocky shores, to the outer continental shelf and slope where they feed. However, they frequent and cross deep oceanic waters in some parts of their range. They sometimes leave haulouts in very large groups but sightings at sea are most often of groups of 1–12 animals. They aggregate in areas of prey abundance, including near fishing vessels where they will feed on netted fish and discarded bycatch. Steller Sea Lions sometimes haul out on sea ice where it is available. They may move long distances but are not considered migratory; juveniles and subadults make the longest trips. Adults usually forage and live near their natal colonies and return to those sites to breed. The area used by adult females for foraging in winter is much greater than the area used in the summer, and females tend to dive deeper in winter than summer. Overall, adults usually forage and use haul-out sites near their natal rookeries, where they typically return to breed. Adult females satellite-tagged in the US portion of the western stock made long pelagic foraging trips during winter, whereas their foraging range was more restricted during summer (Merrick and Loughlin 1997, Fadely and Lander 2012, Fadely <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2013). Adult females are capable of diving to depths of at least 427 m but average approximately 45 m; dives are deeper during winter than summer (NMFS, unpublished data). Dive duration is usually two minutes or less, but can exceed 13 minutes (Rehberg and Burns 2008). Dives of juveniles are generally shallow and short. Diving ability of pups increases with age (Loughlin <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2003, Fadely <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2005, Lander <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2010), with dives ranging on average from 5-35 m and up to 2 min (Loughlin <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2003, NMFS, unpublished data). Juvenile Sea Lions satellite-tagged in Southeast Alaska and Washington State made deeper average dives, and had higher dive rates and longer dive durations than juveniles in western Alaska (Loughlin <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2003, Pitcher <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2005). The diving of adult males has not been studied.<br/><br/>Steller Sea Lions feed on many types of fishes and invertebrates. Much of the information on diet comes from Alaska, where they feed on Walleye Pollock, Pacific Cod, Atka Mackerel, Herring, Sand Lance, several species of Flatfish, Salmon, and Rockfish, and invertebrates such as Squid and Octopus (Sinclair and Zeppelin 2002). Food habits analysis using samples collected between 1990 and 2009 indicate that Western Steller Sea Lions in the U.S. consumed similar prey by region throughout the time period, but the distribution range of prey use increased over time (Sinclair <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2013). Adult females with young pups feed primarily at night, switching to foraging at any time of day after the breeding season. Steller Sea Lions are known to kill and consume young northern Fur Seals at the Pribilof Islands, as well as Harbor and Ringed Seals.<br/><br/>The primary predators of Steller Sea Lions are Killer Whales (Loughlin 2009). Sleeper Sharks have been suggested as a potential predator of juvenile Western Steller Sea Lions in the Gulf of Alaska (Horning and Mellish 2014), although previous work in the same area found that none of the 198 Sharks examined near rookeries during summer contained Steller Sea Lion remains (Sigler <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2006).","<p>The greatest threat to Loughlin’s Steller Sea Lions has been intentional culling in Southeast Alaska and Canada in the 1950s and 1960s. Those practices were discontinued in the early 1970s and the population has been increasing ever since. Some are killed in net fisheries off the west coast of North America. An unknown number may be shot during commercial fishing operations although it is generally believed that this source of mortality has been reduced greatly since the establishment of federal laws prohibiting killing of Sea Lions in Canada and the USA (NMFS 2013). The 2008 Steller Sea Lion Recovery Plan found that there were no apparent threats limiting the recovery of the Loughlin’s Steller Sea Lion population (NMFS 2008), and the increasing population trend confirms that conclusion.<br/> <br/> The reasons for the large declines in Western Steller Sea Lion are unclear, but they have been the subject of intensive and ongoing investigations. Deliberate killing by fishermen, disease, incidental take by fisheries, and reduced food supply have been suggested as factors that may have contributed to the decline (Lowry <em>et al</em>. 1989, Loughlin and York 2000). In the 2008 Recovery Plan, the Steller Sea Lion Recovery Team identified and ranked threats to recovery using a weight of evidence approach to assess their relative impact (NMFS 2008). They recognized three threats as “potentially high”: environmental variability, competition with commercial fisheries, and Killer Whale predation. The fact that this subspecies has been increasing since 2000 indicates that at least some of the threats previously affecting the population have been reduced.</p>","The US National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) uses a Bayesian approach (agTrend; Johnson and Fritz 2014) to model all Steller Sea Lion survey data in the US range and to estimate the population trends presented here.&#160; Counts in the Alaska portion of the range are made from aircraft using standardized photographic methods.&#160; Counts in the Russian portion of the range are collected from shore or from small boats only.<br/><br/>Counts of Western Steller Sea Lions declined by approximately 69% between 1977 and 2007 (NMFS 2008). Using historical counts (NMFS 2008 and unpublished data; Burkanov and Loughlin 2005, Burkanov unpublished data) and the most recent data from counts made in 2015 (NMFS unpublished data, Burkanov <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> in press, Burkanov, unpublished data) the decline for 1985-2015 (three generations) is estimated to be approximately 62% in the USA and 50% for the entire population, including Russia. However, despite continued declines in the western Aleutian Islands, overall abundance has increased in both the USA (1.8% per year) and in Russia since the early 1990s (86% total increase between early 1990s to 2013/2015). Total abundance of the Western population is estimated to be approximately 79,929 in 2015 with 55,791 in the USA&#160; and 24,138 in Russia. The Loughlin’s Steller Sea Lion population has increased at an average rate of more than 3% per year since 1979. Total abundance of this subspecies in 2015 is estimated from regional data up to 2010, 2013, and 2015 is approximately 80,938 (NMFS unpublished data). When the two subspecies are combined, the global abundance of Steller Sea Lions is estimated to be approximately 160,867 in 2015, which is a reduction of 13% since 1985.<br/><br/>Population viability analyses have been conducted for the Western and Loughlin’s Steller Sea Lion subspecies but not for the species as a whole. However, given that abundance of both subspecies is currently increasing the probability of extinction is certainly less than 10% in 100 years.",Increasing,"Steller Sea Lions normally occur from central California north along the west coast of North America, westward through the Gulf of Alaska and the Aleutian Islands to the Kamchatka Peninsula, and from there south along the Kuril Islands to northern Japan and the Sea of Japan (Loughlin 2009). They also occur in the Sea of Okhotsk and the Bering Sea north to Bering Strait. Vagrants have been recorded in China, and at Herschel Island in the Canadian Beaufort Sea (Rice 1998). The western subspecies primarily occupies the area west of 144° W longitude. The eastern subspecies occurs from east of 144° W longitude south along the North American coast to central California.","Steller Sea Lions have been harvested for commercial purposes in both the USA (Alaska) and the Soviet Union/Russia, but commercial harvesting ceased decades ago.&#160; They have been used as a subsistence resource by indigenous people for thousands of years. The US Marine Mammal Protection Act allows Alaska Natives to take Steller Sea Lions for subsistence and creation of Native handicrafts, and currently they are primarily taken in communities in the northern Gulf of Alaska and Aleutian Islands (Haynes and Mishler 1991). The most recent (2007-2011) estimates of the overall average Alaska Native harvest were 199/year for the Western Steller Sea Lion and 11.3/year for the Loughlin’s Steller Sea Lion (Allen and Angliss 2014).",Terrestrial|Marine,"Western Steller Sea Lions are listed as vulnerable in the Threatened Wildlife of Japan Red Data Book. Hattori and Yamamura (2014) reported that over 200 Steller Sea Lions were culled annually between 1960-1993 to reduce predation on commercial fish stocks. Recent work indicates that the annual culling was then reduced to a limit of 116/year until 2010 at which time a new 5 year quota of 1,030 culled Sea Lions was imposed. This resulted in an increased annual average take (Matsuda <em>et al.</em> 2015). In 2015 approximately 400 Steller Sea Lions were reported to be culled in Japan (Yamamura <em>et al.</em> 2015). In Russia, the major Steller Sea Lion rookeries were given protection under the Northern Fur Seal and Sea Otter Conservation Act in the late 1950s. They were listed as endangered (category 2) in the Russian Red Data Book in 1994 and harvest was prohibited. These measures had a positive effect in the western portion of the range as the population increased around Sakhalin Island, the Kuril Islands, and in the northern Sea of Okhotsk. However, abundance along the eastern coast of Kamchatka and in the Commander Islands has not recovered for unknown reasons (V. Burkanov pers. comm.).<br/><br/>In the USA the Steller Sea Lion is listed as depleted under the US Marine Mammal Protection Act. The species was listed as threatened under the ESA in 1990, and in 1997 the western population was uplisted to endangered. A recovery plan for Steller Sea Lions was approved in 1992, and a revised recovery plan was published in 2008. Critical habitat was designated under the ESA in 1993. No-entry zones were established around rookeries at the time of listing, and fisheries, particularly those operating in critical habitat, have been managed to reduce the likelihood of competitive interactions. Substantial funding has been made available for Steller Sea Lion research to develop information on ecology, behavior, genetics, population dynamics, and movements. Results have been used to assist in the development of management activities, to attempt to understand the reasons for the decline, and to promote recovery of the species (NMFS 2008). The fact that the overall growth rate of the western population is now positive suggests that at least some of these conservation efforts have had a beneficial effect. A species status review conducted in 2013 found that the Loughlin’s Steller Sea Lion population increased more than 3% per year since the 1970s and therefore it was removed from the ESA threatened species list (NMFS 2013). The western population in the USA is still listed as endangered under the ESA.",Nearctic|Palearctic,,false,false,Global

Due to its large and increasing population, expanding range and lack of foreseeable threats, the Northern Elephant Seal is listed as Least Concern.<br/></p>","Northern Elephant Seals are the second largest species in the order Pinnipedia and they display significant sexual dimorphism in size and secondary sexual characteristics (Deutsch <em>et al</em>. 1994). Males are three to four times heavier, and nearly 1.5 times the length, of adult females. Adult males reach 4.2 m in length and a maximum weight of 2,500 kg. Mean length for males is 3.85 m and mean weight is 1,844 kg. Maximum weight is seen when the bulls are newly arrived for the breeding season after a summer and fall largely spent feeding (Deutsch <em>et al</em>. 1990). The mean length of adult females is 2.65 m, and they can reach a length of 2.82 m. Mean mass is 488 kg, with a maximum recorded mass of 710 kg, both values are from shortly after females give birth. Newborn pups are about 1.25 m long and weigh 30-40 kg. Pups are born in a long woolly black lanugo coat that is shed without the epidermis starting at about 4-5 weeks and usually lasting several weeks until after the pup is weaned (Reiter <em>et al</em>. 1981). After molting, the newly weaned juvenile’s coat is made up of short hairs like those found on adults and they are counter shaded dark grey above and silver grey below.<br/><br/>During the time on land for breeding or molting, Elephant Seals undergo a complete fast (no food or water) and their body weight declines dramatically due to the demands of lactation (females) and defending territories (males) in the breeding season, and growth of new hair and skin during the molt (Champagne <em>et al</em>. 2012). Adult females can lose almost half their mass during lactation, when they take their single pup from birth to weaning in approximately 25 days. The situation is similar for breeding males, which also lose about half their mass while ashore for periods that can exceed three months.<br/><br/>Females reach sexual maturity at the age of 3-4 years and males at 7-9 years. Gestation lasts 11.3 months, including a delay of implantation. The annual pregnancy rate of mature females is 95%. Longevity is more than 14 years for males and 21 years for females (Condit <em>et al</em>. 2013).<br/><br/>Northern Elephant Seals are highly polygynous, but not strictly territorial. Males compete for access to females by ranking themselves in a hierarchy. There is much male-male fighting, vocalizing, and displaying during the breeding season, when bulls may be ashore for months at a time (LeBeouf 1972). One of the most impressive displays occurs when a male rears up on his hindquarters, thrusts one half to two-thirds of his body upward and produces a distinctive clap threat vocalization as a challenge to other bulls. The sound is a rolling, resonant, metallic-sounding series of backfire-like sounds punctuated with pauses (Sanvito and Galimberti 2003).<br/><br/>Females give birth within a few days of coming ashore, from late December to March. They have a throaty sputtering growl, made with the mouth wide-open, which is used as threat signal. Females and pups have a warbling scream that they use to call to each other, and in the case of the pup, to notify its mother when it is disturbed (LeBeouf 1972). Mother and pup form a strong bond immediately after birth, and females aggressively bite other pups that approach them, occasionally killing them with bites to the head (LeBeouf 1972). However, bulls are a greater source of pup mortality as they regularly crush pups when they charge through aggregations of mothers and pups to chase off or fight encroaching males, or when approaching females for mating. Occasionally, bulls suffocate pups by stopping on top of them and not moving again soon enough (Spraker <em>et al</em>. 2014).<br/><br/>Northern Elephant Seals are one of the deepest and longest diving marine mammals. Time-depth recording devices have documented dives deeper than 1,700 m and as long as 109 minutes by adult females. Rest intervals at the surface are usually short, lasting only several minutes between dives that have an average duration of 23 minutes and depth of 520 m (Robinson <em>et al</em>. 2012). After leaving the rookeries, most Elephant Seals spend 80-90% of their time underwater, helping explain why they are infrequently seen at sea.<br/><br/>The diet of Northern Elephant Seals is largely unknown due to difficulties associated with identifying prey for such a wide-ranging species. Observations based on scat and stomach content analysis of animals on land have identified squid and mesopelagic fish as the main items consumed. New evidence from animals sampled at the Año Nuevo colony (northern California) on diet composition from biochemical techniques indicates that adult females are eating approximately 51% squid, 23% myctophids, and other mesopelagic fish (C. Goetsch pers. comm.).<br/><br/>Great White Sharks and Killer Whales are predators on Northern Elephant Seals (Jefferson <em>et al</em>. 1981). Recent work at the rookeries has revealed that large Great White Sharks aggregate around these sites when Elephant Seals return to haul out (Klimley <em>et al</em>. 2001). Seals that swim at or near the surface as they are approaching or departing the islands are particularly vulnerable to ambush attacks by fast-rising sharks that patrol near the bottom in waters 7-10 meters deep.","Incidental take of Northern Elephant Seals does occur in a variety of coastal net fisheries, but at low levels. This is assumed to be because they move offshore rapidly after leaving colonies to minimize their risk of predation. Anecdotal information points out to an increase in the number individuals observed entangled on land, perhaps as a consequence of the overlap between their at-sea foraging range and the “North Pacific garbage patch”. Some of the lesions caused by these entanglements could lead to the death of individuals, but there are no data on the rate of animals entangled and their survival. Most of the prey of the Northern Elephant Seal is either of low or no commercial fishery value. If the population continues to expand there will likely be new rookeries on mainland beaches, and there will be additional challenges to keep conflicts with humans and domestic and feral animals to a minimum. The risk of transfer of diseases, such as morbillivirus from domestic animals to Northern Elephant Seals, is unknown, but the species is considered to be one of several pinnipeds at high risk of disease outbreaks because of their rapidly expanding population and environmental changes associated with global warming (Lavigne and Schmitz 1990). Tourism at several mainland locations in the United States is extremely popular but highly regulated and is not considered a major threat to the species. Tourist access to nearly all of&#160; the islands occupied by Elephant Seals is controlled by law or otherwise regulated in the United States and Mexico, although a number of Mexican islands are inhabited either year round or most of the year by fishermen and their families.<br/><br/>As the species has now recovered from a very small number of survivors, it has likely lost a considerable amount of diversity from passing through this genetic bottleneck, and may now be at greater risk from disease outbreaks and environmental change.","Northern Elephant Seals were a prime target for commercial sealing, and the population was nearly extirpated by hunting during 1818-1869. Due to their pelagic nature, the fact that most animals spend 80% or more of their lives at sea, and that they do all not return to their rookeries at the same time, a few individuals were able to survive the wholesale slaughters at rookery sites. By 1890 only one group of about 100 animals was known to exist (Bartholomew and Hubbs 1990). Following a slow recovery in the early 1900s, Northern Elephant Seals recolonized formerly used sites throughout the 1980s. The total population size in 2010 was estimated to be between 210,000 and 239,000 animals (Lowry <em>et al</em>. 2014). Information for the population in Mexico needs to be updated, but at least for US waters most of the growth in population size has been associated with an increase in the size and number of rookeries in southern California’s Channel Islands. At rookeries in the USA, the population grew at a rate of 17% per year during 1958-1987, slowing to a growth rate of 3.8% per year during 1988-2010 (Lowry <em>et al</em>. 2014).",Increasing,"Northern Elephant Seals are a wide ranging pelagic species that occurs throughout most of the eastern Pacific Ocean north of the 27°N latitude, from the coast of Baja California to the Gulf of Alaska and the Aleutian Islands, westward to about the International Dateline (180° longitude) (Le Boeuf et al. 2000, Robinson <em>et al</em>. 2012). Breeding takes place on offshore islands and at a few mainland localities from central Baja California, Mexico, to Northern California, USA. The species breeds at over 15 discrete locations, of which a dozen are well-known and occur mostly on islands of southern California and Baja California (Lowry <em>et al</em>. 2014). A few pups are born in Oregon, Washington, and southern British Columbia.<br/><br/>Adult Northern Elephant Seals migrate to and from their rookeries twice a year, returning once to breed during December-March and again later in the year (April-August) for several weeks to molt, at different times depending on sex and age (LeBeouf <em>et al</em>. 2000). They also show up at additional coastal sites as far north as southern Oregon for molting. Their post-breeding and post-molt migrations take most females north and west to oceanic areas of the North Pacific and Gulf of Alaska twice a year (LeBeouf <em>et al</em>. 2000, Robinson <em>et al</em>. 2012). Adult males, on the other hand, tend to occupy the shelf break along the Aleutian Islands. Few movement data are available for younger age classes and consequently their at-sea distribution is poorly known. Vagrants have been documented in Japan and at the Midway Islands.","The Northern Elephant Seal was heavily exploited for its oil during 1818-1869, after which it was commercially extinct (Bartholomew and Hubbs 1960). Few animals remained and in the 1900s they were completely protected by both Mexico and the U.S.",Terrestrial|Marine,"<p>In the USA, Northern Elephant Seals are fully protected by the Marine Mammal Protection Act. In Mexico, Elephant Seals are protected from direct harvest under the Norma Oficial Mexicana (NOM-059-ECOL-2001).

45228501,15106,Odobenus rosmarus,Vulnerable,A3c,2016,2016-02-05 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"While Walruses occur over a vast area and are common in some regions, their future is by no means secure. Climatic warming will surely require them to live in a much different environment as sea ice recedes and disappears from many of the areas they have used in past centuries (Kovacs <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2011, 2012, 2015; Laidre <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2008, 2015). All reasonable scenarios expect that such drastic changes to their habitats will cause Walrus populations to decline throughout most of their range. Because of the expectation of a decline the IUCN SSC Pinniped Specialist Group has recommended that the Atlantic Walrus be listed as Near Threatened under criterion C1, and they have recommended that the Pacific Walrus be listed as Data Deficient. Models suggest that Pacific Walrus abundance declined by 50% between 1980 and 2000 (Udevitz <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2009), and there is ongoing concern about female body condition and possible impacts on calf survival (Kovacs <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2015). Considering both the certainty of future decline in their habitat quality and the limitations of abundance and trend data, the Walrus as a species is listed as Vulnerable under criterion A3c.","The Walrus’s most distinctive feature is the external tusks, which are possessed by both males and females. The tusks can grow to be a meter long and can weigh 5 kg in large bulls. They are one of the largest pinnipeds with Pacific Walrus males reaching 3.6 m in length and weighing 880-1,557 kg; adult females are about 3 m and 580-1,039 kg. Atlantic Walrus adults are slightly shorter and lighter. Newborns are 1-1.4 m long and weigh 33-85 kg (Fay 1981, Kovacs and Lydersen 2006).<br/><br/>Walruses are extremely social animals, and when on land or ice they are normally found in tight groups ranging in size from a few individual up to thousands. At sea they usually travel in groups as well (Fay 1981, Kovacs and Lydersen 2006). There is significant sexual segregation outside the breeding season, with males often being found in areas away from females and their calves. Walruses have a narrow ecological niche. They depend on: 1) the availability of large areas of shallow water with suitable bottom substrate to support a productive bivalve community, 2) the presence of reliable open water over rich feeding areas, particularly in winter when access to feeding areas is limited by ice cover, and 3) the presence of haul out areas in reasonably close proximity to feeding areas. The preferred haul out platform is sea ice, although both subspecies routinely use terrestrial haul out sites in the summer and autumn (Fay 1981, Hamilton <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2015).<br/><br/>Because they feed in shallow, coastal areas Walruses usually perform only relatively shallow, short dives (Fay and Burns 1988, Born 2005). The Walrus’s main prey is bivalve mollusks that they search for using their sensitive whiskers on or in soft-bottom substrates. In addition to Clams, their diet can include Worms, Snails, soft shell Crabs, Amphipods, Shrimp, Sea Cucumbers, Tunicates, and even slow-moving Fishes (Born 2005, Sheffield and Grebmeier 2009). Some Walruses prey on birds and other marine mammals, eating a variety of Seal species (Lowry and Fay 1984, Fox <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2010, Seymour <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2014). Walrus make foraging trips that last from a few hours to several days; in the Pacific, trips are shorter in duration and distance when they originate from sea ice versus land (Udevitz <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2009).<br/><br/>Courtship and mating occur in the winter. Walruses are polygynous and the males establish small aquatic territories where they vigorously vocalize and display adjacent to females hauled-out on ice floes (Sjare and Stirling 1996, Sjare <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2003). Most births occur in May of the following year. Most female Walrus give birth at 7-10 years old and usually they only produce one calf every three years. Males become sexually mature between 7-10 years old, but are not physically and socially mature enough to successfully compete for breeding opportunities until they are approximately 15 years old. Longevity is approximately 40 years (Fay 1981).<br/><br/>The primary predators of Walrus are Polar Bears and Killer Whales (Killian and Stirling 1978, Fay 1981).","Human harvests have had a major impact on abundance of Pacific Walrus over the past 200 years (Fay <em>et al.</em> 1997). The Pacific Walrus continues to be an important subsistence resource for indigenous people in coastal Alaska (Robards <em>et al.</em> 2013), and harvests in recent years are likely to have been sustainable (Garlich-Miller <em>et al.</em> 2011, Udevitz <em>et al.</em> 2013). The future, however, is uncertain, and as global warming and concomitant sea ice declines impact the Walrus population harvest levels could have an important influence on future abundance (Jay <em>et al.</em> 2011). A variety of mechanisms are available at the international, national, and local level that could be used to ensure that future harvests remain sustainable (Garlich-Miller <em>et al.</em> 2011, MacCracken 2012). Atlantic Walruses are protected from harvest in Norway (Henriksen and Hilmo 2015) and in Russia (Boltunov <em>et al.</em> 2010). Subsistence harvests are regulated by quotas in Canada and in Greenland and additionally, females are not supposed to be harvested in Greenland (Wiig <em>et al.</em> 2014). Recovery is the management target for all currently harvested Atlantic Walrus stocks so allowable takes are conservative.<br/><br/>Observations of incidental take of Pacific Walrus indicate that direct conflicts with fisheries are uncommon (US Fish and Wildlife Service 2010); however, trawl fisheries could disturb important benthic feeding areas (COSEWIC 2006). Human disturbance at land-based haul-out sites, low-level aircraft over-flights and near-shore passage of vessels can have serious effects on hauled out Walruses, as they are highly susceptible to disturbance and easily panicked into stampedes that can result in high mortality, particularly among calves (Udevitz <em>et al.</em> 2013). Walruses feed low in the trophic web, so generally have relatively low levels of contaminants in their tissues, though individuals that consume marine mammal prey are likely at higher risks (Wolkers <em>et al.</em> 2006, Skoglund <em>et al.</em> 2010). Sedimentation from industrial development can cause degradation of their prey populations and oil pollution can negatively impact the filter-feeding Clams that make up most of their diet.<br/><br/>Global warming and associated reduction in the extent, seasonal persistence, and characteristics of sea ice are likely to negatively affect Walrus (e.g., Huntington 2009; Kovacs <em>et al.</em> 2011, 2012, 2015). The seasonal duration of ice cover is shrinking throughout their range, and at the extreme the Barents Sea region has lost 42 days of ice coverage per decade during 1979-2013 (Laidre <em>et al.</em> 2015). Declining sea ice reduces suitable strata for pupping and breeding aggregations and limits access to offshore feeding areas (Laidre <em>et al.</em> 2008, Kovacs <em>et al.</em> 2011). Global climate models suggest moderate changes in winter-spring ice conditions in the Bering Sea by the mid-2000s (20-30% ice loss) and major changes by the late-2000s (60-90% loss). Summer sea ice in the Chukchi Sea is predicted to show major losses (&gt;80%) by the mid-2000s (Garlich-Miller <em>et al.</em> 2011). In prior years, Walrus in the Chukchi Sea spent the summer hauling out mostly on sea ice and foraging over a wide area on the shallow continental shelf (Fay 1982). In recent years with little or no summer ice cover, animals have begun to haul out on land in large groups and go to sea to forage from there (Robards and Garlich-Miller 2013). Coastal haul-outs are less suitable because of increased energy required to reach prey resources and mortality due to crowding, disturbance events, and predation (Jay <em>et al.</em> 2011, Garlich-Miller <em>et al.</em> 2011, MacCracken 2012). Reduction in sea ice has already lead to increased shipping and development of oil and gas fields in the southern parts of the Walrus’s range, bringing increased risk of spills and discharge of pollutants and disturbance (Semyonova <em>et al.</em> 2015), and oil and gas exploration is moving north rapidly with exploration licenses having already been granted in East Greenland.","The Pinniped Specialists Group assessed the abundance and trend of the two Walrus subspecies as follows:<br/><ul><li>Atlantic Walrus--total abundance likely &gt;25,000, some subpopulations increasing but overall trend unknown</li><li>Pacific Walrus--total abundance likely &gt;200,000, trend unknown</li></ul>Considering these results, the abundance of the Walrus species as a whole is likely &gt;225,000 and the trend is unknown.",Unknown,"Walruses have a discontinuous circumpolar Arctic and sub-Arctic distribution and are mostly found in relatively shallow continental shelf areas (Fay 1981, Rice 1998). The Atlantic Walrus occurs from the eastern Canadian Arctic to the western Kara Sea (Stewart <em>et al</em>. 2014). Within that region nine stocks are generally recognized. Historically, Atlantic walruses occurred south to the Gulf of Saint Lawrence in the northwestern North Atlantic, but they were extirpated in this region by excessive harvesting (McLeod <em>et al</em>. 2014). Vagrants have been reported from New England, Iceland, and from Norway south to the Bay of Biscay in France/Spain. The Pacific Walrus normally ranges from the Bering and Chukchi Seas, which constitute the center of its range, to the Laptev Sea in the west and the Beaufort Sea in the east, with vagrants south into the North Pacific Ocean to Japan and southcentral Alaska (Fay 1982).","Native people of the Arctic have depended on Walrus for food, hides, ivory and bones since first contact, and subsistence harvests continue today in Canada, Greenland, Alaska, and Russia. All Walrus populations were severely depleted by episodic commercial hunting that was heaviest from the 18th through to the mid-20th centuries (Fay 1982). Since the 1970s, the Pacific Walrus has been managed under numerous international and national conservation programs that have eliminated commercial hunting and limited trade (Garlich-Miller <em>et al.</em> 2011). The Pacific Walrus continues to be an important subsistence resource for indigenous people in coastal Alaska (Robards <em>et al.</em> 2013), and harvests in recent years are likely to have been well within sustainable limits (Garlich-Miller <em>et al.</em> 2011, Udevitz <em>et al.</em> 2013). Atlantic Walruses are protected from harvest in Norway and in Russia (Boltunov <em>et al.</em> 2010, Henriksen and Hilmo 2015). Harvests are quota regulated in Canada and in Greenland, and additionally females are not supposed to be harvested in Greenland (Wiig <em>et al.</em> 2014).<br/><br/>Walrus are listed on Appendix III of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora which allows for control of global trade in Walrus ivory.",Terrestrial|Marine,"Atlantic Walruses are protected from harvest in Norway and in Russia; they are on the Norwegian Red List (Henriksen and Hilmo 2015) and they are listed in the Russian Red Book (Boltunov <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2010). Harvests are quota regulated in Canada and in Greenland (Wiig <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2014). The Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada designated the Atlantic Walrus as a species of “special concern”, which acknowledges that they are at risk of becoming threatened in this region; this classification is attributed to climate change impacts on sea ice (COSEWIC 2006).<br/><br/>Within the USA, the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) generally prohibits taking of Walrus unless it is by an Alaska Native for subsistence or production of handicrafts. MMPA regulations are used to control impacts caused by commercial fishing, oil and gas development, and other human activities. The Pacific Walrus is currently under consideration for listing under the US Endangered Species Act which would provide additional protections. Within the US there are currently no legal mechanisms to regulate discharge of greenhouse gas emissions, the primary cause of climate warming and sea ice loss (Garlich-Miller <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2011).<br/><br/>In Russia, Walruses were commercially harvested through the 1980s, but harvests ended in 1991 due to economic collapse of the industry. The “Law of Fisheries and Preservation of Aquatic Resources” provides for subsistence harvest of Pacific Walruses by aboriginal Russian peoples, and a quota is determined annually. Russian legislation prohibits sport hunting of Pacific Walruses, and a variety of types of protection are afforded to major haulout sites along the Russian coast (Garlich-Miller <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2011).",Nearctic|Palearctic,,false,false,Global
45229114,17013,Phoca vitulina,Least Concern,,2016,2016-01-04 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"Harbor Seals are distributed very widely and their total population size is estimated at about 600,000. Trend in abundance is unknown for four of the subspecies; the Eastern Pacific Harbor Seal is known to be increasing. While in many areas Harbor Seals share the coastal zone with increasing human populations and suffer some impacts as a result, current threats appear to be tolerable and/or manageable. As a species, the Harbor Seal does not meet any IUCN criteria for a threatened listing and is listed as Least Concern. However, the subspecies <em>Phoca vitulina mellonae</em>, the Ungava Seal, is listed separately as Endangered.","Harbor Seals live mostly in the coastal waters of the continental shelf and slope, and are commonly found in bays, rivers, estuaries, and intertidal areas. They also occur in some lakes (Burns 2009). They will haul out on rocks, sand and shingle beaches, sand bars, mud flats, vegetation, sea ice, glacial ice and a variety of man-made structures. They usually lie close to the water to permit a rapid escape from threats. Sex and age segregation is common in most populations (Kovacs <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1990). They are usually extremely wary and shy on land and therefore it is almost impossible to approach them when they are hauled out without stampeding them into the water. However, habituation to human activities in their vicinity can occur. Most haul-out sites are used daily, based on tidal cycles and other environmental variables, although foraging trips can last for several days (Grellier <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1996, Lowry <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2001). Although Harbor Seals are considered a non-migratory species with a high degree of site fidelity to a haul out, long-distance dispersal of juveniles, emigration, and establishment of new haul out sites do occur (Ries <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1999, Bjorge <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2002). There is also evidence of seasonal changes in at-sea distribution and home range size by age class and sex (Lowry <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2001, Dietz <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2013).<br/><br/>Adult male Harbor Seals are 1.6-1.9 m long and weigh 70-150 kg, adult females are 1.5-1.7 m and 60-110 kg. At birth, pups are 82-98 cm and 8-12 kg (Burns 2009). Males become sexually mature when four to six years old. Female Harbor Seals usually become sexually mature when three to five years old (Harkonen and Heide-Jorgensen 1990). Throughout the Harbor Seal's range, the time of birthing varies widely and may follow a latitudinal cline (Temte 1994). Peak pupping date varies from mid March to early September. The mating system is promiscuous, or weakly polygynous, with males defending underwater calling sites (Boness <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2006, Van Parijs and Kovacs 2002). Mating usually takes place in the water, with females coming into oestrus about a month after giving birth. Molt follows the pupping and mating season. The timing of onset of molt depends on the age and sex of the animal with yearlings molting first and adult males last (Reder <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2003). <br/><br/>Females give birth to a single precocial pup. Most pups shed their silvery gray lanugo coat in the uterus before birth and are born with a juvenile pelage. Exceptions to this include pups born prematurely, and some that are born early in the breeding season (Bowen <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1994). Pups usually enter the water soon after birth, and because of tidal inundation at many sites used for birthing, this often occurs within hours (Burns 2009). Pups are suckled for an average of 26 days (Drescher 1979). Unlike Grey Seals, Harbor Seal females need to feed during the lactation period to produce adequate milk for their rapidly growing pup, and as a result they undertake regular feeding trips to sea (Thompson <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1994, Bowen <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2001).<br/><br/>At sea, Harbor Seals are most often seen alone, but they occasionally occur in small groups. Localized aggregations can form in response to feeding opportunities and concentration of prey. Harbor Seals are generalist feeders that take a wide variety of fish, cephalopods, and crustaceans obtained from surface, mid-water, and benthic habitats (e.g., Pitcher 1980, Harkonen 1987, Olesiuk <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1990, Pierce <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1991). Their diet is highly varied, and animals from different populations and areas show differences, and there is also variation associated with seasonal and interannual changes in the abundance of prey (e.g., Tollit <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1997, Thompson <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1996). Generally, a few species dominate the diet at any one location and time of year. They are primarily a coastal species with dive depths generally less than 100 m (Tollit <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1998), but dives to as much as 480 m have been recorded in Alaska (Frost <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2001). <br/><br/>Longevity is about 30-35 years with females living longer than males. Known predators include Killer Whales, Great White and Greenland Sharks, and possibly other Shark species, Steller Sea Lions, Walrus, Eagles, Gulls, and Ravens (Burns 2009).","Historically, there have been organized population reduction programs and bounty schemes for Harbor Seals in some range states, largely because of perceived competition with fisheries. Hunting and/or licensed killing to protect fisheries has largely been eliminated but subsistence hunting by Alaska Natives is allowed in the US. In the eastern Atlantic, Harbor Seal population reduction programs date from the early 1980s and 1990s in Iceland and Scotland, respectively (Bowen and Lidgard 2012) and continue at some level today (e.g., Butler <em>et al.</em> 2008). An extermination program at the beginning of the 20th century dramatically depleted Harbor Seals in the Baltic Sea. Quotas for Harbor Seals are set annually in Norway and a bounty is paid to hunters in several regions of the country.<br/><br/>Mass die-offs from viral outbreaks have killed thousands of Harbor Seals on both sides of the Atlantic, but most notably in Europe caused by phocine distemper virus (Dietz <em>et al.</em> 1989, Harkonen <em>et al.</em> 2006, Reijnders 1986). Because Harbor Seals haul out on nearshore and coastal mainland sites, they are exposed to terrestrial wild carnivores, pets and feral animals, and waste from human populations that create an increased risk of exposure to communicable diseases. <br/><br/>Because many Harbor Seals live and feed in close proximity to large populations of humans they are exposed to, and can accumulate, high levels of industrial and agricultural pollutants (e.g., organochlorines, PCBs, dioxins) that negatively affect reproduction (Reijnders 1986), induce vitamin deficiency (Brouwer <em>et al.</em> 1989), and cause immunosuppression (Ross <em>et al.</em> 1995). Both chronic oil spills and discharges and episodic large-scale spills can cause direct mortality (Frost <em>et al.</em> 1994, 1999; Hoover-Miller <em>et al.</em> 2001) and could have long term impacts on Harbor Seal health and their environment. <br/><br/>Noise and other disturbance from offshore oil and gas, and the development of offshore renewable energy such as wind farms, may also affect the foraging behavior and physical condition of Harbor Seals (Hastie <em>et al.</em> 2015, Skeate <em>et al.</em> 2012).<br/><br/>Harbor Seals live in coastal areas many of which are heavily fished and this results in entanglement and bycatch issues (see Desportes <em>et al.</em> 2010) Overfishing and environmental variability (including global climate change) may also impact Harbor Seal prey populations.","Available data on Harbor Seal abundance were compiled and reviewed in the 2016 Red List assessments for the five recognized subspecies.<br/>Estimates of the number of mature individuals, and population trend, for each of those subspecies were as follows:<br/><ul><li>Eastern Atlantic Harbor Seal--65,000, trend unknown</li><li>Western Atlantic Harbor Seal--60,000, trend unknown</li><li>Eastern Pacific Harbor Seal--170,000, increasing</li><li>Kuril Seal--&lt;10,000, trend unknown</li><li>Ungava Seal--50, trend unknown</li></ul>Combining those estimates, the total number of mature Harbor Seals worldwide is about 315,000. Bjorge <em>et al</em>. (2010) estimated the total worldwide population of Harbor Seals as approximately 610,000-640,000. The overall trend in numbers is unknown.",Unknown,"Harbor Seals are one of the most widespread of the pinnipeds. They are found throughout coastal waters of the northern hemisphere, from temperate to polar regions. Five subspecies are recognized:&#160;the Eastern Atlantic Harbor Seal&#160;occurs in the eastern Atlantic from Brittany to the Barents Sea in northwestern Russia and north to Svalbard, with occasional sightings as far south as northern Portugal,&#160;the Western Atlantic Harbor Seal&#160;occurs in the western Atlantic from the mid-Atlantic United States to the Canadian Arctic and east to Greenland and Iceland,&#160;the Ungava Seal&#160;only lives in a few lakes and rivers in northern Quebec, Canada, that drain into Hudson and James Bays,&#160;the&#160;Eastern Pacific Harbor Seal&#160;is found in the eastern Pacific from central Baja California, Mexico to the end of the Alaskan Peninsula and possibly to the eastern Aleutian Islands, and&#160;the Kuril Seal&#160;ranges from either the end of the Alaskan Peninsula or the eastern Aleutians to the Commander Islands, Kamchatka, and through the Kuril Islands to Hokkaido (Rice 1998).","Harbor Seals were commercially harvested in British Columbia, and commercial and recreational use also occurred in Alaska. All commercial harvesting ceased several decades ago. Harbor Seals were protected in Canada in 1970 by the Fisheries Act. The U.S. Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 provided a broad prohibition on taking of any marine mammal. However, Alaska Natives are allowed to harvest Harbor Seals for subsistence and creation of authentic handicrafts, and Native handicrafts and edible portions may be sold in Native villages and towns. Some subsistence harvesting still occurs in Alaska, as well as in Canada and Greenland. In Russia, Kuril Seals are listed in the Red Data Book and there is no legal harvest.",Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,"Harbor seals at Svalbard are protected under the Norwegian National Red List. Hunting of Harbor Seals in the Baltic Sea was prohibited in 1970 and management of this species in the Baltic Sea and Southern Scandinavian waters is the responsibility of HELCOM. Denmark and Sweden have established Harbor Seal sanctuaries. Neighboring states of the Wadden Sea have signed a trilateral agreement for the management of Harbor Seals. Since 1994, Harbor Seals have been considered vulnerable on the French national Red List. In the United Kingdom, Harbor Seals are protected under the Conservation of Seals Act and the Marine Scotland Act.<br/><br/>In the United States the Harbor Seal is protected from all but Alaska Native subsistence hunting by the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972, which also prohibits importation of parts or products from all seals. In Canada, the management of Seals is regulated within the Canadian Department of Fisheries and Oceans though the Fisheries Act and the Marine Mammal Regulations of 1993. Ungava Seals are being considered for designation as “Endangered” by COSEWIC and are listed as “Schedule 3, Special Concern” under Canada’s Species at Risk Act.

45229806,17023,Phoca largha,Least Concern,,2016,2015-06-03 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,The Spotted Seal is an abundant species and there is no evidence of recent declines in the main part of its range. It is therefore listed as Least Concern.<br/><br/><em></em>,"In the Bering Sea and Sea of Okhotsk, adult female Spotted Seals usually weigh 65-115 kg and are 151-169 cm long, while adult males weigh 85-110 kg and are 161-176 cm long (Boveng <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2009). Maximum reported length was 182 cm for females and 185 cm for males (Tikhomirov 1968).<br/><br/>In spring, Spotted Seals give birth to a single pup, typically on the surface of sea ice but in some places on shore, particularly in the Bohai Sea, Peter the Great Bay, the South Kuril Islands, the second Kuril Strait, Utashud Island, and the east coast of Kamchatka (Trukhin 2005). Pups are born in a white lanugo coat that is shed at or before weaning, which occurs about four weeks after birth. At birth pups are 75-92 cm long and weigh 7-12 kg, and they grow to 30 kg or more by weaning (Boveng <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2009). Mating occurs after pups are weaned. Spotted Seals are annually monogamous and males defend lactating females on ice floes. Groups composed of a female with her pup and a male, called triads, are common during the breeding season (Quakenbush 1988).<br/><br/>In late-spring and summer many Spotted Seals leave the sea ice and haul out on land to rest when they are not foraging. On some haul-out sites in Kamchatka the number of animals on shore may exceed 10,000 individuals (V. Burkanov pers. comm.). As sea ice forms in October-November Spotted Seals again use the ice as their primary feeding and resting habitat (Burkanov 1990; Lowry <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1998, 2000). They are generalist feeders that take primarily a variety of fish species (Walleye Pollock, Arctic and Saffron Cod, Rockfish, Herring, Sand Lance, Smelt, Capelin, Eelpout, Salmon, Flatfishes), cephalopods (Squid and Octopus) and crustaceans (Shrimp and Crab) (Burkanov 1990, Quakenbush <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2009).<br/><br/>Reported predators include Pacific Sleeper Sharks, Killer Whales, Golden Eagles, Steller’s Sea Eagles, Ravens, Gulls, Polar and Brown Bears, Wolves, Arctic Foxes, Walruses and Steller Sea Lions (Quakenbush 1988).","Intensive harvesting of fish in the Okhotsk and Bering seas poses a risk to Spotted Seals, as several of their main prey species are targets of commercial fisheries (Lowry and Frost 1985). Entanglement in commercial fisheries occurs occasionally in Japan and in the Sea of Okhotsk and Bering Sea. Small, organized control kills to limit damage to fisheries regularly occur in Japan (Mizuno <em>et al.</em> 2001, Angliss and Outlaw 2007). In Kamchatka, Spotted Seals sometimes eat fish out of fishing gear and fishermen shoot small numbers in local areas to defend their landings and protect their equipment (V. Burkanov, pers. comm.).<br/><br/>Oil and gas development may cause disturbance to and adversely affect the habitat used by Spotted Seals (Reijnders <em>et al</em>. 1993). Oil contamination poses poorly known risks to their populations, but the closely related North Pacific Harbor Seal was impacted by oil spilled from the tanker <em>Exxon Valdez</em> (Frost <em>et al</em>. 1994). The greatest impacts would likely result if spills occurred during the pupping season, if food resources were negatively affected, or if the spill was an event that affected a large area (St. Aubin 1990). A variety of contaminants have been found in Spotted Seals sampled in Alaska but their potential impacts are largely unknown (Quakenbush<em> et al</em>. 2009). Contaminant concerns would be greatest for animals living in the western part of the range where they occur near large population and industrial areas in China, Korea, and Japan.<br/><br/>Reduction in late winter and spring sea ice cover as a result of the disrupted, warming climate could be problematic for Spotted Seals as the majority of the population uses pack ice at the southern limit of the ice extent for pupping (e.g., Tynan and DeMaster 1997). Changes to ice characteristics that affect its location, timing, stability, etc. could result in lower survival of Spotted Seal pups. This threat is strongest in the southern parts of the range, the Yellow Sea and Sea of Japan, where ice extent and seasonal persistence time have already been greatly reduced (Boveng <em>et al</em>. 2009). The threat may be mitigated somewhat in the Bering Sea, where a long-term range shift northward would be possible through Bering Strait to the Chukchi Sea, where seasonal formation of suitable ice is projected to occur beyond the current century under the most commonly used global climate models (Boveng <em>et al</em>. 2009). Disruption or alteration of the patterns of primary productivity and abundance of key prey species, either by sea ice loss or ocean acidification could also have detrimental effects on Spotted Seals, though the magnitude and even the direction of impacts are very uncertain (Boveng <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2009).","The abundance of Spotted Seals has never been well quantified. Poorly documented estimates suggest a total population size in the 1970s of perhaps 400,000, with 200-250,000 in the Bering-Chukchi Seas and perhaps 170,000 in the Okhotsk Sea (Bigg 1981, Quakenbush 1988). More recent surveys indicate the total number may be in excess of 640,000 individuals, with more than 460,000 in the Bering Sea (Conn <em>et al</em>. 2014), 180,000 in the Sea of Okhotsk (Fedoseev 2000), and about 3,300 in the Yellow Sea and Sea of Japan (Han <em>et al</em>. 2010, Nesterenko and Katin 2009). Surveys have been too irregular and imprecise to measure population trend, but Alaska Native hunters have not reported any notable changes in the availability of Spotted Seals (Boveng <em>et al</em>. 2009, Quakenbush <em>et al</em>. 2009).<br/><br/>Maximum longevity is at least 35 years (Quakenbush 1988). Less than a third of females and males become sexually mature by age 3, about two-thirds of both sexes become mature by age 4, and nearly all (i.e., &gt;90%) are sexually mature by age 5 (Tikhomirov 1966, Naito and Nishiwaki 1972, Fedoseev 2000, Boveng <em>et al</em>. 2009).",Unknown,"Spotted Seals breed in the Bering Sea, the Sea of Okhotsk, the Sea of Japan, the Yellow Sea, and the Bohia Sea. They are also found outside the breeding season in the Chukchi and Beaufort seas, ranging north into the Arctic Ocean to about the edge of the continental shelf, west to about 170°E longitude, and east to the Mackenzie River Delta in Canada (Shaughnessey and Fay 1977, Quakenbush 1988). They inhabit the southern edge of the pack ice from winter to early summer. In late summer and fall, Spotted Seals move into coastal areas, including river mouths. They rarely occur in water depths greater than 200 m (Lowry <em>et al</em>. 2000). They breed mostly on sea ice and haul-out on sea ice when it is available, but they also haul out on beaches and sandbars (Burns 1970; Lowry <em>et al</em>. 1998, 2000). There are several sites along the Asian coast where Spotted Seals breed on small remote islands (e.g., in Peter the Great Gulf, the Kuril Islands, and small islands along east coast of Kamchatka; Burkanov 1988, 1990; Trukhin and Katin 2001; Kostenko <em>et al</em>. 2004; Vertyankin and Nikulin 2004).","Alaska Natives are allowed to take marine mammals for subsistence and creation of handicrafts. Subsistence hunting of Spotted Seals has no doubt occurred since humans first made contact with the species and they remain an important subsistence resource for coastal Alaska Natives in western Alaska (Quakenbush 1988, Allen and Angliss 2014). From the 1960s through the 1980s, the Soviet Union harvested several thousand Spotted Seals each year in both the Okhotsk and Bering seas, mostly from large commercial vessels (Heptner 1996). Commercial harvesting of this species no longer occurs in Russia.",Terrestrial|Marine,"In the United States the Spotted Seal is generally protected from all but subsistence hunting by Alaska Natives under the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972, which also generally prohibits import and export of parts or products from all marine mammals.<br/><br/>Commercial harvesting of Spotted Seals from vessels of the Russian Federation ended in 1994. Small scale commercial and subsistence harvests from small boats and land occurs along the Russian Far East coast, but the size of the harvest is relatively small (V. Burkanov pers. comm.).<br/><br/>Spotted Seals are listed in the Second Category (II) of the State Key Protected Wildlife List in China, listed as Vulnerable in the China Red Data Book of Endangered Animals, and designated a vulnerable species under the Wildlife Conservation Act of China (Wang 1998). However, as of 2004, no “conservation action, public awareness or education programmes have been carried out for the species in this region” (Won and Yoo 2004).<br/><br/>In 2000, Spotted Seals were afforded protected status under the Wildlife Conservation Act of South Korea.

45230310,41666,Zalophus californianus,Least Concern,,2015,2014-12-12 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<p>California Sea Lions have recovered from historical exploitation and their population is now large and still expanding slowly. Beyond the temporal effects of El Niño events, no other major threats are apparent. They should be listed by IUCN as of Least Concern.</p>","The California Sea Lion is a sexually dimorphic species; adult males weigh three to four times more and are up to 1.2 times longer than their female counterparts (King 1964). By two weeks of age, male pups are larger and heavier (75.7 cm, 9.01 kg) than their female counterparts (72.3 cm, 7.6 kg; Le Boeuf <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1983). Pups are born with a thick brownish-black lanugo that is generally moulted between the first and second month and is replaced by a darker coat. Nursing may last from one to two years (Newsome <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2006). Male California Sea Lions measure up to 255 cm in length and can weigh up to 523 kg (Wright <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2010). Females measure up to 200 cm and weigh an average of 110 kg (Peterson and Bartholomew 1967).<br/><br/>Both sexes usually reach maturity by four to five years of age. Females produce one pup each year, with a gestation period of approximately 11 months. A long-term mark-resighting study (1980-2006) recorded a maximum observed lifespan of 19 years for males and 25 years for females (Hernandez-Camacho <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2008a). Mean age-specific birth rates for females vary among age classes: for five-year-olds the rate is 0.59, for six- to 10-year-olds it is 0.79 (Melin 2002, Hernandez-Camacho <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2008b), 10- to 12-year-olds exhibit the highest rate (0.80), but the rate gradually decreases for individuals &gt;13 years old to 0.06 in 22 to 25 years olds (Hernandez-Camacho <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2008b).<br/><br/>Pupping and breeding take place from May through July. Pupping starts earlier in the Gulf of California (May 8) than off the coast of California (May 20); the duration of the breeding season is also longer in the Gulf (13 weeks) than off the coast of California (9.5 weeks; Garcia-Aguilar and Aurioles-Gamboa 2003a). Males are highly polygynous and defend their territories both on land and in shallow waters near the shore for periods of up to 45 days. A study on the plasticity of male territorial behaviour in response to varying environmental conditions showed that males inhabiting high-temperature environments (air temperatures &gt;30°C, e.g., the Gulf of California) defend territories adjacent to the coast while immersed in the water (Bohorquez-Herrera <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2014). Females remain on shore with their newborn pups for approximately seven days before they depart for the first of many foraging trips that usually last two to three days, followed by another one to two days of caring for their pups at the rookery (Melin <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2000, García-Aguilar and Aurioles-Gamboa 2003b). &#160;<br/><br/>Following the breeding season, large numbers of adult and subadult males and juveniles migrate north from the major rookeries in southern California and Baja California and winter from central California to Washington (Fry 1939, Odell 1975, Mate 1975). Smaller numbers of animals migrate to British Columbia (Wright <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2010) and southeast Alaska, reaching the northern Gulf of Alaska, the Alaska Peninsula, and the eastern Aleutian Islands (Maniscalco <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2004). Other animals remain in the Gulf of California year round and do not undertake long migrations; however, the arrival of numerous adult and subadult males is observed every year at several rookeries and haul-out areas around the southern tip of the Baja California Peninsula (Aurioles-Gamboa <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1983).<br/><br/>During the breeding (warm) season, 96% of the dives by lactating adult females from San Miguel Island, California were to depths of eight to 75 m with 92% of dives lasting less than four minutes. During the non-breeding (cold) season, 77% of the dives were between eight and 75 m and 81% lasted four minutes or less. Most dives during both the breeding (84.5%) and non-breeding (81.2%) seasons occurred less than 150 km from San Miguel Island (Melin and DeLong 2000).<br/><br/>During the breeding season, the average dive depth for lactating adult females in the Gulf of California is 81.7±32 m with average dive duration of 3.5±0.9 min. During the cold season, dive depth and duration average 48.9±18.5 m and 1.7±0.6 min, respectively. The distance travelled during the breeding and cold season varies from 72.7±21.8 km to 101.2±18.5 km, respectively (Villegas-Amtmann <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2011). Adult females and males exhibit three distinct foraging behaviors to exploit the benthic, epi-pelagic and meso-pelagic environments (Weise <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2010, Villegas-Amtmann<em> <em>et al.</em></em> 2011). <br/><br/>California Sea Lions are generally found in waters over the continental shelf and slope zones; they also frequent coastal areas, including bays, harbours and river mouths. Their feeding habits are influenced by coastal ecosystems and they consume a wide variety of prey. However, they usually prefer four to five species at each site, often consuming what is abundant locally or seasonally in the areas they occupy (Lowry <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1990, Garcia-Rodriguez and Aurioles-Gamboa 2004). Their main prey in California are Pacific Sardines (<em>Sardinops sagax</em>), Northern Anchovies (<em>Engraulis mordax</em>), Pacific Hake (<em>Merlucius productus</em>), Jack Mackerel (<em>Trachurus symmetricus</em>), Pacific Mackerel (<em>Scomber japonicus</em>), various species of the genus <em>Sebastes</em>, Red Octopus (<em>Octopus rubescens</em>) and Market Squid (<em>Loligo opalescens</em>; Antonelis <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1984, Lowry <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1990, Lowry 1991, Lowry and Carretta 1999). On the Pacific coast of Baja California, Sea Lions consume many of the same prey species as well as north Pacific Argentine (<em>Argentina sialis</em>) and Jumbo Squid (<em>Dosidicus gigas</em>; Aurioles-Gamboa and Camacho-Rios 2007). In the Gulf of California, the main prey species include those listed above and many other fish and squid species, including Pacific Cutlassfish (<em>Trichiurus lepturus</em>), Plainfin Midshipman (<em>Porichthys notatus</em>), Anchoveta (<em>Cetengraulis mysticetus</em>), Eastern Pacific Flagfin (<em>Aulopus bajacali</em>), Bigeye Bass (<em>Pronotogrammus eos</em>) and Deepwater Serrano (<em>Serranus aequidens</em>; Aurioles-Gamboa <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1984, Garcia-Rodriguez and Aurioles-Gamboa 2004).<br/><br/>Ontogenetic differences in diving capacities and feeding habits have been documented for California Sea Lions (Weise and Costa 2007, Orr <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2011), which can be affected by El Niño and La Niña events (Lowry and Carretta 1999, Weise and Harvey 2008). During the 1993 El Niño, adult females travelled farther from the colony, spent more time travelling, made deeper and longer dives, and terminated lactation earlier compared to 1996. Their mean dive depths varied from 19.5 to 279.3 m, but most females made some dives deeper than 400 m (Melin <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2008). During one unusually warm year, adult males that forage almost exclusively over the continental shelf altered their foraging effort by spending more time at sea and venturing up to 450 km offshore (Weise <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2006).<br/><br/>Due to their coastal distribution, abundance and feeding habits, California Sea Lions interact with several fisheries, including those for Pacific Salmon (DeMaster <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1982,&#160;DeMaster&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>1985, Aurioles-Gamboa <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2003, Weise and Harvey 2005,&#160;Weise and Harvey&#160;2008), causing economic losses for sport and commercial fishermen and a high incidence of Sea Lion entanglement (Stewart and Yochem 1987, Harcourt <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1994, Zavala and Mellink 1996, Aurioles-Gamboa <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2003).<br/><br/>Predators of California Sea Lions include Killer Whales, Sharks, Coyotes and feral Dogs. Before their recent eradication from California’s Channel Islands, Bald Eagles were known to take young pups.","Conflicts with fisheries, poaching and entanglement in marine debris contribute to California Sea Lion mortality (Stewart and Yochem 1987, Howorth 1994, Harcourt <em>et al.</em> 1994, Zavala and Mellink 1996, Aurioles-Gamboa <em>et al.</em> 2003). Prey availability is greatly reduced during El Niño events and large numbers of pups born during these periods die of starvation, as do weaker animals of all age classes (Francis and Heath 1991, Shirasago-German <em>et al.</em> 2015). Sea lion rookeries in the Gulf of California do not appear to be greatly influenced by El Niño events (Aurioles and Le Boeuf 1991, Szteren <em>et al.</em> 2006).<br/><br/>California Sea Lions accumulate pollutants through the food chain, and large amounts of DDT and PCBs discharged in the past continue to accumulate in coastal marine food chains that include this species (DeLong <em>et al.</em> 1973, Le Boeuf <em>et al.</em> 2002). California Sea Lions occasionally die of paralytic shellfish poisoning caused by domoic acid, a biotoxin produced by diatom blooms that enters the food web through planktivorous fish, such as Herring and Sardines (Scholin <em>et al.</em> 2000, Silvagni <em>et al.</em> 2005). Diseases also contribute to California Sea Lion mortality, including some contracted from terrestrial animals, like leptospirosis (Vedros <em>et al.</em> 1971), an endemic disease with periodic epidemics of acute disease (Lloyd-Smith <em>et al.</em> 2007). Contact with feral and domestic dogs and other terrestrial animals may expose the species to additional diseases like brucellosis, which may cause miscarriages (Goldstein <em>et al.</em> 2009, Avalos-Tellez <em>et al.</em> 2014).","Exploitation during the 19th and 20th centuries reduced the California Sea Lion population, but not as much as some other pinniped species (Gerber and Hilborn 2001). Odell (1971) estimated the size of the breeding population on the California Channel Islands to be approximately 35,000 in 1964. Since then the population size has increased considerably.<br/><br/>Five geographic populations have been identified based on mitochondrial DNA: 1) Pacific temperate, from California to northern Baja California; 2) Pacific subtropical, along the west coast of Baja California; 3) southern Gulf of California; 4) central Gulf of California; and 5) northern Gulf of California (Schramm <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2009). Using both nuclear and mitochondrial DNA, the population structure in Mexico suggests a pattern of isolation by distance resulting in at least three management units: the Pacific coast of Baja California, the southern Gulf of California, and the north-central Gulf of California (González-Suárez <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2009). The species does not show signs of a reduction in genetic variability (González-Suarez&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2009,&#160;Schramm <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2009,&#160;González-Suarez&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2010).<br/><br/>It is not possible to directly count individuals in order to obtain the total population size because not all age- and sex-classes are on shore at the same time. Therefore, the size of the population is estimated based on the number of births and the proportion of pups in the population following the methods developed by Boveng (1998) and Lowry <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> (1992). Pups are the only age class constantly on land during the reproductive season, and thus they are used as a reference point in estimating the other age classes. The 2007 minimum population on the Channel Islands and at haul-out sites located between Point Conception and Point Reyes was 153,337. For the same year, the estimated total population in the USA was estimated at 296,750 (Carretta <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2014). In Mexico, the species occupies both sides of the Baja California Peninsula. In 2010, the total population size on the Pacific coast was 58,859 individuals (Milanés-Salinas 2012) while the population in the Gulf of California consisted of 32,037 individuals (Aurioles-Gamboa, unpublished data). Thus, the total population of California Sea Lions is approximately 387,646.<br/><br/>The California Sea Lion population is thought to be reaching carrying capacity in the USA (Carretta <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2007), however recent censuses suggest the population is still increasing (Carretta <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2014). The Gulf of California does not show a similarly marked fluctuation (Szteren <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2006, Ward <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2010), and animals in the Gulf are genetically isolated from individuals inhabiting the rest of the species’ geographic distribution (Maldonado <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 1995, Bowen <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2005, Schramm <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2009).",Increasing,"California Sea Lion rookeries are found on islands from Los Islotes in Baja California Sur to the Channel Islands in southern California. Some pups have been reported from Año Nuevo Island and the Farallon Islands in central California (Keith <em>et al</em>. 1984). In addition to rookeries, this species also occupies haul-out sites, mainly during the fall and winter when predominately adult and sub-adult males move north to Oregon (USA) and British Columbia (Canada; Fry 1939, Mate 1975, Odell 1975). In the southern part of their range, haul-out areas are known to occur on islets off the coast of Mazatlán and the Islas Tres Marias north of Puerto Vallarta; however, this area has not been surveyed for decades. This species’ overall range extends north through the Gulf of Alaska as far as the Aleutian Islands (Maniscalco <em>et al</em>. 2004), and south around the end of the Baja California Peninsula to the Gulf of California. Between 2005 and 2013, several California Sea Lion sightings were reported as far south as Punta San Pedrillo, Costa Rica (Lenin Oviedo pers. comm.). A California Sea Lion male was sighted off the coast of the Yamsky Islands in the Shelikova Bay in the Sea of Okhotsk in 2007, 2008 and 2011. On each occasion, the animal was seen with a group of Steller Sea Lions. It was not observed during 2013 and 2014 (Vladimir Burkanov pers. comm.). Females, which were only very rarely found north of Point Conception, California in the early 1980s, are now routinely found in northern California, where former breeding sites have been reoccupied. However, adult female California Sea Lions tend to reside at their rookeries (Hernández-Camacho <em>et al</em>. 2008a). Based on estimates of sex biases in gene flow, females disperse on average 6.75 times less frequently than their male counterparts (González-Suarez <em>et al</em>. 2009).","<p>California Sea Lions were historically important to indigenous people living in coastal areas and on islands used by Sea Lions for rookeries (Arellano-Peralta and Medrano-Gonzalez 2015). Huge middens in southern California and on the Channel Islands with large numbers of California Sea Lion and other pinniped bones attest to the past importance of marine mammals for subsistence prior to the changes that followed the arrival of Europeans on the west coast of North America (Porcasi <em>et al</em>. 2000, Braje and DeLong 2009). In the 19th and early 20th centuries, California Sea Lions were harvested intensively for a variety of products and hunted for bounties to reduce their impact on fisheries (Cass 1985, Gerber and Hillborn 2001, Arellano-Peralta and Medrano-Gonzalez 2015).</p>",Terrestrial|Marine,"<p>Protection, which began in the mid-20th century in the United States, was solidified with the passage of the U.S. Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 and similar laws in Mexico. These protective measures provided the impetus for recovery of the population. At coastal sites and on most offshore islands, tourism is highly regulated and controlled. The National Marine Fisheries Service regularly monitors the California Sea Lion population in US waters. The Mexican federal government’s Comisión Nacional de Areas Naturales Protegidas (National Commission of Natural Protected Areas) has conducted annual censuses and monitored the health of the California Sea Lion populations in the Gulf of California since 2011.</p>",Nearctic,,false,false,Global
45230946,41670,Histriophoca fasciata,Least Concern,,2016,2015-06-09 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"Despite recent progress in population assessment, estimates of total abundance of Ribbon Seals are imprecise and current population trend is not known. But, with modern assessment methods producing an estimate of nearly 400,000 animals it is evident that the population is quite large. Commercial harvesting of Ribbon Seals stopped in 1994 and numbers have likely been growing since then. The only major threat identified is climate change, and effects of that are not likely to occur in the near future. Ribbon Seals are classified as Least Concern.","Ribbon Seals are medium sized phocids, with a striking pattern of light bands on their darker pelage. Pups at birth are about 86 cm long and weigh about 9.5 kg. Males and females are similar in size with adults typically 150-175 cm long, and weighing 70-90 kg (Tikhomirov 1968, Burns 1981, Fedoseev 2000).<br/><br/>Female Ribbon Seals mature when they are 2-4 years old and males when they are 3-5 years. Adult females give birth to a single white-coated pup in March-May that is nursed for 3-4 weeks. Clean, white, broken pack ice is preferred as a birth site over solid ice sheets and ice with sediment or algae. Breeding occurs after the pup is weaned, and gestation lasts about 9 months after 2-2.5 months of delayed implantation. Ribbon Seals generally live to about 20 years old, but maximum longevity may be as much as 30 years (Burns 1981, Boveng <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2013).<br/><br/>From late winter until summer, Ribbon Seals occupy the pack ice that overlies the continental shelf. They prefer areas of 60-80% ice coverage, rarely use shore fast ice, and do not haul-out on land unless moribund (Kelly 1988, Burns 1981). They typically lie away from the edge of floes and show little concern for the approach of people or vessels. Broken pack ice is preferred over solid ice sheets and highly concentrated pack ice. Their whereabouts when pack ice breaks up or disappears from the Bering Sea and the Sea of Okhotsk is not well known. Kelly (1988) suggested that animals from the Bering Sea population summer in the Chukchi Sea and those from the Sea of Okhotsk, where Ribbon Seals are not seen after mid-July, might move into the southern Bering Sea. Burns (1981) reported that few Ribbon Seals are seen on ice or harvested by Alaska Natives in the Bering Strait and Chukchi Sea after mid-June, and suggested that many Ribbon Seals are probably pelagic during summer and fall, not hauling out on land or ice until the next winter.<br/><br/>Satellite-linked tags were applied to more than 80 Ribbon Seals captured in spring 2005-2010 in the ice of the central and western Bering Sea (Boveng <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2013). All tagged Seals were pelagic during summer and fall. They ranged widely through the Aleutian Islands, Bering Sea, Bering Strait, Chukchi Sea, and adjacent Arctic Basin. Ribbon Seals from the Okhotsk Sea have not been tagged and tracked.<br/><br/>The overall diet of Ribbon Seals is unknown because essentially all the samples that have been examined came from the spring period when the primary activities are pupping, breeding, and molting, and most stomachs are empty. Prey items identified from spring samples included at least 25 species of fishes and 23 species of invertebrates. Commonly occurring prey included Walleye Pollock, Arctic Cod, Pacific Cod, Saffron Cod, Capelin, Smooth Lumpsucker, Eelpout, flatfish, Squids, Octopus, and crustaceans. Crustaceans (Euphausiids and Shrimps) appear to be a main food item for newly weaned and young Seals (Boveng <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2013). Using both stomach contents and stable isotope analysis, Dehn <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> (2007) concluded that trophic level of the Ribbon Seal diet increased with age of the Seal, suggesting a diet transition from mostly crustaceans in young animals to fish and nektobenthos in older animals. The only two stomach samples collected in mid-winter contained Walleye Pollock and Arctic Cod (Burns 1981).<br/><br/>Dive data provided by satellite-linked tags showed relatively shallow diving (mostly to &lt;100 m) during spring when Seals are over the continental shelf, with deeper diving occasionally to &gt;600 m at other times when the Seals may be over deep basins (Boveng <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2013).","Ribbon Seals are sometimes incidentally caught in commercial fisheries, but bycatch data are incomplete. Available data suggest a take of approximately one per year by the Alaska fisheries that were monitored during 1990-2007 (Boveng <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2013). Woodley and Lavigne (1991) reported catches of a few up to 14 per year in fisheries around Japan. During seven years (1993-1999) of monitoring the offshore salmon gill net fishery in Russian Far East, incidental mortality of Ribbon Seals was estimated to be 1,079 individuals (154 per year), mostly juveniles (Burkanov and Nikulin 2001). These data certainly underestimate the total take as bycatch is not monitored in a number of Russian and Alaskan fisheries.<br/><br/>Commercial fisheries target a number of known Ribbon Seal prey species (e.g., Walleye Pollock, Pacific Cod, Pacific Herring, and Capelin), and it is possible that reductions in prey biomass caused by fishing could have an impact on Seal nutrition. At the current time, biomasses of these fishes are fairly high and stable, at least in the Bering Sea, and impacts of removals on Ribbon Seal nutrition are not likely. This situation could change, however, as fishing patterns shift with warming waters and reduced sea ice (Boveng <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2013).<br/><br/>As is true for all ice-associated pinnipeds, climate warming and reductions in seasonal sea ice are likely to have impacts on Ribbon Seals. A detailed review of this issue by Boveng <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> (2013) analyzed the possible individual and cumulative effects on Ribbon Seals of future warmer temperatures, reduced ice, ocean acidification, and associated changes in prey, predators, parasites, and diseases. They concluded that while impacts are likely at some point in the future, they are very difficult to predict or quantify.","Three separate populations of Ribbon Seals have been proposed associated with aggregations of breeding animals - the Bering Sea, the southern Sea of Okhotsk, and the northern Sea of Okhotsk (Fedoseev 2002). However, Boveng <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> (2013) considered the biological evidence for separate breeding populations in the Okhotsk and Bering seas to be weak or equivocal, and they assessed the status of Ribbon Seals as a species with a single population.<br/><br/>Ribbon Seals are difficult to enumerate, as they are widely dispersed over large areas that are generally far from land. Nonetheless, a number of population estimates have been proposed based on counts made during aerial surveys flown over sea ice in the Bering and Okhotsk seas (see Boveng <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2013). In most cases surveys were not designed specifically for Ribbon Seals, and the methods used varied and were often not well described. Burns (1981) reported a population estimate of 90,000-100,000 animals in the Bering Sea, and 140,000 animals in the Okhotsk Sea. Fedoseev (2002) gave an estimate of 120,000 to 140,000 animals for the Bering Sea in 1987 and estimates of between 200,000 (1968-1974) and 630,000 (1988-1990) for the Okhotsk Sea. The Okhotsk Sea population was reported to have averaged 370,000 animals with 320,000 in the central northwestern region and 50,000 in the southern region, in the period between 1968 and 1990 (Fedoseev 2002). Little information was collected on Ribbon Seal abundance between 1991 and 2007. Boveng <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> (2008) used eastern and central Bering Sea survey results from 2007, combined with information on distribution (Fedoseev 1973, Fedoseev <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 1988), to estimate the range-wide abundance of Ribbon Seals as 267,000. The 95% credible interval for that estimate was 154,000-827,000.<br/><br/>American and Russian scientists conducted image-based aerial surveys of ice-associated Seals in the Bering and Okhotsk seas in 2012 and 2013. Data from those surveys are not yet fully analyzed, but using a limited subsample of the data collected from the U.S. portion of the Bering Sea in 2012, Conn <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> (2014) estimated about 184,000 (95% CI: 145,752-230,134) Ribbon Seals in that area. The estimate from the 2013 survey in the Okhotsk Sea was 181,179 (95% CI: 118,392–316,995) Ribbon Seals (Chernook <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2014). The mean estimate from the two surveys combined is about 365,000 animals.<br/><br/>Population trend is unknown.",Unknown,"Ribbon Seals inhabit the northern North Pacific Ocean and adjoining seas, and are seen most commonly in the Bering and Okhotsk seas hauled out on sea ice in the ice front region. They are seen on ice until it has melted in May-June, and seldom haul out on ice or land until the following spring (Burns 1981). The presumption that they live a pelagic lifestyle during summer and fall has been corroborated by tracking with satellite-linked tags (Boveng <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2013). Results from tagging and occasional sightings indicate that during the ice free months they range from Hokkaido and the northern Sea of Japan, eastward through the northern North Pacific and Aleutian Islands to the western Gulf of Alaska, and northward through the Chukchi Sea to the East Siberian Sea, the western Beaufort Sea, and the Arctic Ocean (Moore and Barrowclough 1984, Mizuno <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2002, Boveng <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2013). Single Ribbon Seals occasionally occur along the coast of North America and Asia outside of their normal range (Boveng <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2013), and a debilitated vagrant was found on the beach in Morro Bay, California, and taken into captivity (Roest 1964).","Russian commercial hunting of Ribbon Seals began in the Okhotsk Sea in the 1930s and expanded to an annual harvest of 20,000 in the 1950s (Heptner 1996). The annual harvest averaged 11,000 from the 1950s to 1969 and 5,000-6,000 from 1969-1992 (Fedoseev 2002). Commercial hunting began in the Bering Sea in 1961 with an average annual harvest of 9,000 through 1968, declining to 3,000 to 4,000 per year from 1969 to 1992 (Heptner 1996). Reported harvests did not include the number of animals that were killed but lost which may have amounted to 15-20% (Fedoseev 2000). Commercial hunting from sealing vessels stopped in the Bering Sea in 1991 and in the Okhotsk Sea in 1994 because of economic factors, but substantial quotas were still allocated at least through 2005 (Boveng <em>et al.</em> 2013).<br/><br/>Ribbon Seal abundance appears to have declined due to the intensive commercial hunting in the late 1950s and 1960s, but began to rebound after quotas were reduced in 1969 (Burns 1981, Boveng <em>et al.</em> 2013).<br/>The number of Ribbon Seals taken by indigenous hunters for subsistence is not well quantified, but harvests are low and almost certainly sustainable (Boveng <em>et al.</em> 2013).",Marine,"Russia stopped large scale commercial harvesting of Ribbon Seals in 1994. Shore-based harvests for subsistence purposes are at very low levels and not likely to be a threat to the population. In the US, Ribbon Seals are protected under the Marine Mammal Protection Act. In 2007, the US National Marine Fisheries Service was petitioned to list the Ribbon Seal as threatened or endangered under the US Endangered Species Act. In 2013 the agency concluded that such a listing was not appropriate at that time (NMFS 2013).",Nearctic|Palearctic,,false,false,Global
45231341,41672,Pusa hispida,Least Concern,,2016,2016-01-16 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"As a species, Ringed Seals are widely distributed in ice-covered waters of the northern hemisphere, and they may presently number about three million animals. Some of the subspecies, however, have restricted distributions and exist in much smaller numbers. With climatic warming, all subspecies will be negatively impacted by continuing decreases of ice habitats critical for their reproduction. Nevertheless, at this time Ringed Seals as a species do not meet any IUCN criteria for a threatened listing, and are listed as Least Concern. Subspecies <em>Pusa hispida ladogensis</em>, the Ladoga Seal, is assessed separately as Vulnerable and subspecies <em>P. h. saimensis</em>, the Saimaa Seal, is assessed as Endangered.","Ringed Seals are in many respects the “classic” ice-seal. Throughout most of their range they use sea ice exclusively as their breeding, molting, and resting (haul-out) habitat, rarely if ever moving onto land (Frost and Lowry 1981, Reeves 1998). Their ability to create and maintain breathing holes in ice using the well-developed claws on their fore-flippers allows them to thrive in areas where even other ice-associated seals cannot reside. Although Ringed Seals are quite small they deal with the thermal challenges posed by the arctic winter by having a very thick blubber layer, and by building lairs (small caves) in the snow on top of sea ice during the winter. The lairs are particularly important for neonatal survival (Lydersen and Smith 1989). Ringed Seals also use natural cracks along pressure ridges and leads in the sea ice for surfacing and breathing. In Lakes Ladoga and Saimaa, the Baltic Sea, the White Sea, and the Sea of Okhotsk, Ringed Seals haul out and pup on ice but rest on shore during the ice-free period (Sipilä and Hyvärinen 1998, Kelly <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2010).<br/><br/>Reported mean age at sexual maturity for female Ringed Seals varies in the literature from 3.5 to 7.1 years (Holst and Stirling 2002, Krafft <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2006). Males likely do not participate in breeding before they are 8-10 years old. Body sizes vary considerably between regions (Frost and Lowry 1981, Sipilä and Hyvärinen 1998). Ringed seals are long lived, with ages close to 50 reported (Lydersen and Gjertz 1987). Regional productivity rates are variable; reproductive success depends on many factors including prey availability, the relative stability of the ice, and sufficient snow accumulation prior to the commencement of breeding (Lukin 1980, Smith 1987, Lydersen 1995). <br/><br/>A single pup is born in late February-early March for the Ladoga, Saimaa, and Baltic subspecies (Sipilä and Hyvärinen 1998) and March-May for the others (Frost and Lowry 1981). Most births occur in subnivean lairs excavated in snow that accumulates near ice ridges or shorelines. Lairs provide thermal protection against cold air temperatures and high wind chill and afford at least some protection from predators (Smith 1976, Smith and Stirling 1975, Gjertz and Lydersen 1986). For Arctic Ringed Seals, lactation lasts an average of 39 days and pups are weaned at approximately 20 kg (Lydersen and Kovacs 1999). Females become receptive for mating towards the end of the lactation period, similar to other phocid seals. <br/><br/>Ringed Seals molt from mid-May to mid-July and during that period they spend quite a bit of time hauled out (Reeves 1998). Feeding intensity is at a minimum during molting (Ryg <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1990). <br/><br/>Although they may dive to more than 500 m (Born <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2004), in many areas where they feed the water is not that deep and dives are correspondingly shallower (Gjertz <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2000).<br/><br/>Outside the breeding and molting seasons, Ringed Seal distribution is correlated with food availability (e.g., Simpkins <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2003, Freitas <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2008). Numerous studies of their diet have been conducted, and although there is considerable regional variation several patterns emerge. Most Ringed Seal prey are small, and preferred prey tend to be schooling species that form dense aggregations. Fishes are usually in the 5-10 cm length range and crustacean prey in the 2-6 cm range. Typically, a variety of 10-15 prey species are found, with no more than 2-4 dominant prey species for any given area. Fishes are generally more commonly eaten than invertebrates, but diet is determined to some extent by availability of various types of prey during particular seasons as well as by preference, which in part is influenced by energy content of various available prey (Reeves 1998, Wathne <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2000). Commonly eaten prey include Polar Cod, Arctic Cod, Saffron Cod, Redfish, Herring, and Capelin in marine waters (Lowry <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1980, Holst <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2001, Labansen <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2007), and Smelt, Vendance, Perch, Roach, Stickleback, and Burbot in lakes (Sipilä and Hyvärinen 1998). Invertebrate prey species seem to become more important in the open-water season and often dominate the diet of young animals (Lowry <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1980, Holst <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2001). Large Amphipods, Krill, Mysids, Shrimps, and Cephalopods are all eaten by Ringed Seals and can be very important in some regions at least seasonally (Agafonova <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2007).<br/><br/>Polar Bears are the most important predator of Arctic Ringed Seals in most parts of their range and they are also eaten by Killer Whales and Walruses. Wolves, Wolverines, Foxes, Gulls, and Ravens may also prey on Ringed Seals, especially pups, in other areas (Reeves 1998).","Ringed Seals carry loads of organochlorine and heavy metal contaminants from industry and agriculture that have been implicated in uterine pathology in Baltic Seals (Bergman and Olsson 1986), and high concentrations of mercury in Saimaa Seals is thought to have reduced pup production in the 1960s and 1970s (Sipilä and Hyvärinen 1998, Kostamo <em>et al</em>. 2002). However, following restrictions on the use and release of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) into the environment, contaminant levels are dropping rapidly in the Baltic (Kostamo <em>et al</em>. 2002). The same is true with regards to POPs in Arctic populations (Wolkers <em>et al</em>. 2008). Oil contamination poses poorly known risks to Ringed Seals. The greatest impacts would likely result if spills occurred during the pupping season or if food resources were negatively affected (Smith 1987, Reeves 1998).<br/><br/>Manipulation of water levels, recreational snow machine operation, net-fishing, boating, tourism, and development of cottages on the shoreline have been noted as threats to the Ringed Seals in Lake Saimaa, and industrial pollution, net fishing and poaching, as well as disturbance of on-shore summer haulout groups have been highlighted as threats for the Ladoga Seals (Sipilä and Hyvärinen 1998, Agafonova <em>et al</em>. 2007). Predation by Red Fox, Wolves, feral and domestic Dogs, and even birds of prey, are also risks for these lake Seals (e.g., Kunnasranta <em>et al</em>. 2001). By-catch in fisheries and other negative impacts associated with fisheries conflicts seem at present to be the major threat to Saimaa and Ladoga Seals (Kokko <em>et al</em>. 1998, Sipilä and Hyvärinen 1998, Verevkin 2002, Sipilä 2003, Agafonova <em>et al</em>. 2007).<br/><br/>Global warming may pose the greatest threat to Ringed Seals of all subspecies if it leads to large losses of the stable ice habitat required for pupping and rearing their young (Tynan and DeMaster 1997, Learmonth <em>et al</em>. 2006, Kovacs and Lydersen 2008, Laidre <em>et al</em>. 2008). Early break-up of the ice results in poor condition of pups and higher mortality rates (Smith and Harwood 2001). Associated changes in precipitation and weather patterns could also negatively affect Ringed Seal populations if there is insufficient snow cover to protect pups in lairs in the spring (Stirling and Derocher 1993, Ferguson&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2005, Kelly&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2010, Hezel&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2012, Iacozza and Ferguson 2014). Pups born outside lairs have a very low chance of survival; the pups are so small that even large Gulls can be predators if they are exposed (Lydersen and Smith 1989). Declining trends in reproduction and survival of pups have already been noted in some regions that have been attributed to earlier break-up of the sea ice over recent decades and concomitant changes in the marine ecosystem (Ferguson <em>et al</em>. 2005, Stirling 2005). Reductions in arctic sea ice could have quite dramatic effects via prey availability if Polar and Arctic Cod populations are negatively impacted.<br/><br/>  Reductions in sea ice cover will likely lead to increased human activity in arctic regions in the form of shipping and resource extraction industries, with associated increased threat of marine accidents and pollution discharge (Pagnan 2000). An increase in human-created noise in the arctic environment could cause marine mammals, including Ringed Seals, to abandon areas (Tynan and DeMaster 1997) although studies to date suggest relatively minor impacts of development (Davis&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;1991; Moulton&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2002, 2003, 2005; Blackwell&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;2004). However, over-flights by aircraft certainly cause disturbance to Ringed Seals if flights occur by helicopter at less than 1,500 m distance or by fixed-winged aircraft at closer than 500 m (Born&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;1999).","Available data on Ringed Seal abundance were compiled and reviewed in the 2016 IUCN Red List assessments for the five recognized subspecies. Estimates of the number of mature individuals, and population trend, for each of those subspecies were as follows:<br/><ul><li>&#160;Arctic Ringed Seal--1,450,000, trend unknown</li><li>&#160;Okhotsk Ringed Seal--44,000, trend unknown</li><li>&#160;Baltic Ringed Seal--11,500, trend increasing</li><li>&#160;Ladoga Seal--3,000-4,500, trend increasing</li><li>&#160;Saimaa Seal--135-190, trend increasing<br/></li></ul>The world-wide population size of Ringed Seals is not accurately known. Some recent survey data are available from parts of their range (see subspecies assessments), but for the Arctic and Okhotsk subspecies data are limited in spatial scope. Citing many factors such as the vast geographic area occupied by the species, its highly variable distribution within areas that have been surveyed, the unknown relationship between the numbers of individuals observed versus those not seen, and other factors, Frost and Lowry (1981) stated that it is “unwise to attempt an estimate of the world population of this subspecies”. Despite numerous surveys at specific locales conducted since then, Reeves (1998) believed that “this conclusion remains appropriate.”<br/><br/>Nevertheless, the figures presented above indicate the number of mature individuals is more than 1.5 million, and the total population size is likely more than 3 million.",Unknown,"Ringed Seals have a circumpolar distribution throughout the Arctic Basin including records of individuals near the North Pole (Rice 1998). Ringed Seals also range widely into adjacent seas being found in the Bering Sea, Chukchi Sea, Beaufort Sea, Canadian Arctic Archipelago, Hudson Bay, Hudson Strait, Davis Strait, and Greenland, Barents, White, Kara, Laptev, and East Siberian Seas, and they occasionally range into some lake and river systems in Northern Canada (Heide-Jørgensen and Lydersen 1998). Separate subspecies occur in the Baltic Sea, Lake Ladoga in the Russian Federation, Lake Saimaa in Finland, and the Sea of Okhotsk (Frost and Lowry 1981, Reeves 1998). Extralimital records for Ringed Seals extend far south on both sides of the Atlantic, to New Jersey USA in the west and Portugal in the east. In the Pacific, vagrants have been recorded south to the Zhejiang in China and southern California&#160;USA (Rice 1998).","Humans have hunted Ringed Seals in the Arctic since the arrival of people to the region millennia ago (e.g., Murdoch 1893, Riewe and Amsden 1979). They are a fundamental subsistence food item for most coastal dwelling northern indigenous peoples. Reeves <em><em>et al.</em></em> (1998) reported a combined estimate of 10,000 taken per year from the Bering, Chukchi, and western Beaufort Seas by Russians and Alaska Natives. They also estimated that the annual removal of Ringed Seals in the Canadian Arctic was in the “high tens of thousands”, and that in the 1980s, including animals killed and lost, the harvest was between 60,000 and 80,000, and may have exceeded 100,000 in some years. Another substantial annual harvest occurs in Greenland with nearly 100,000 taken per year in the 1970s and approximately 70,000 taken annually in the early1990s (Teilmann and Kapel 1998).<br/><br/>Commercial harvests of Ringed Seals in the early to mid-20th century were sometimes large and probably had significant local impacts on the respective populations. Harvest statistics reported for western Russia by Belikov and Boltunov (1998) suggest that maximum catches earlier in the 20th century exceeded the total allowable catches (TACs) significantly, with harvests of up to 8,900 in the White Sea (1912), 13,200 in the Russian Barents Sea (1962), and 13,200 in the Kara Sea (1933). Those harvests are thought to have dropped considerably in recent decades, though there are no available data. Reporting of harvest statistics and enforcement of TACs is difficult to manage in outlying areas, and the harvest of Ringed Seals in eastern Russia is largely unknown.<br/><br/>Although Ringed Seals in the Baltic and Lakes Ladoga and Saimaa were hunted in the past, hunting is no longer allowed (Sipilä and Hyvärinen 1998, Härkönen <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1998).",Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,"Ringed Seals are protected by a variety of laws and quotas in different parts of their range, but even within Europe the legal provisions are not always being fully implemented in domestic law (Wilson <em>et al</em>. 2001). The population in Lake Saimaa has been protected since 1955, and additional protection has been afforded via the establishment of two national parks within the lake, and regulation of shoreline development. Similarly, the hunting of Seals in Lake Ladoga was prohibited in 1980 (Sipilä and Hyvärinen 1998). In the USA, the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 allows Ringed Seals to be harvested only by Alaskan Native hunters for subsistence purposes, and that Act generally prohibits all other forms of taking except where specifically permitted. In 2012, the Arctic, Okhotsk, and Baltic subspecies were listed as threatened, and the Ladoga subspecies was listed as endangered, under the US Endangered Species Act; the Saimaa subspecies was listed as endangered in 1993. <a name=""_GoBack""></a>State Nature Reserves at Franz Josef Land and in the White and Kara seas protect large areas of Ringed Seal habitat in the western Russian Arctic, and quotas and licensing of hunting have been in place in various parts of the Russian Federation for decades (Belikov and Boltunov 1998).

This species was recorded in 6% of the underwater surveys conducted from 2014 to 2016 in Hong Kong coral and rocky reefs and the density index was 1.55 out of 4 (Shea and Ho 2016). It was the fourth most abundant species observed during a wet market survey of wild-caught grouper in Hong Kong during 2004 to 2006, and nearly all were immature (To and Sadovy de Mitcheson 2009). A wet market survey conducted in 2012/2013 reported it to rank 12th by abundance (i.e., 2.4%) among all groupers that were both locally caught and imported, and almost all were immature (S. Lam unpublished data). In Hong Kong, most medium-bodied grouper species have declined. According to mariculturists in Hong Kong, the supply of wild-caught fingerlings/juveniles for grow-out has declined presumably due to overfishing. In southern China, fingerlings are near extirpated (Sadovy 2000), which suggests a decline in the adult source populations has occurred throughout Southeast Asia (L. Min pers. comm. 2007).

Overfishing is likely not occurring in any of the stocks, but may have occurred in 10% or more of the species' range sometime over the past five years.<br/><br/>This species is listed as Least Concern under criterion A1. As this species has a circumglobal distribution and a very large global population size, it does not meet any of the thresholds for criteria B, C or D, and criterion E cannot be applied because a quantitative analysis of future extinction probability is not available. However, it is important to note that there is no adequate measure of population trends for this species in the Eastern Pacific, and that an estimate of no change in the East Atlantic population is based on visual inspection of CPUE trends. Additionally, fishing mortality is continuously increasing for both adults and juveniles in at least the Western and Central Pacific, and the 2017 provisional catch estimate for the Eastern Atlantic is greater than recommended.","Skipjack Tuna are pelagic and oceanodromous in offshore waters to depths of 330 m (Collette and Graves 2019), with Schaefer and Fuller (2007) recording a dive as deep as 596 m. Their lower temperature limit appears to be about 18 °C, but the upper temperature limit apparently varies with size, from 30 °C or more for small fish to 25 °C for the largest fish. Skipjack are also limited to water with unusually high concentrations of dissolved oxygen, at least 3.0–3.5 ml/l (4–5 ppm) for long-term survival. Larval Skipjack Tuna occur from the lower portion of the mixed layer to the upper portion of the thermocline in a temperature range of 20–25 °C and a salinity range of 33.6–35.5.<br/><br/>Skipjack Tuna exhibit a strong tendency to school in surface waters often in association with floating objects, sharks, and whales, but apparently not in the Mediterranean Sea. They often form mixed schools with small Yellowfin Tuna (<em>Thunnus albacares</em>) and Bigeye Tuna (<em>T. obesus</em>) when associated with floating objects, and in the Western Atlantic are commonly found in schools with Blackfin Tuna (<em>T. atlanticus</em>). The species feeds on fishes, squids, and crustaceans. It is preyed upon by large pelagic fishes, particularly billfishes. Skipjack Tuna are very fast-growing, relatively short-lived, and extremely fecund (Collette and Graves 2019).<br/><br/>Longevity, as calculated from growth rings on the first dorsal spine or sagittal otolith, is estimated to be at least seven years (Collette and Graves 2019). Age of first maturity is estimated to be 1.5 years (Maunder and Harley 2005). In the Western and Central Pacific Ocean, about 50% of the fish are mature by 0.75 years and more than 90% of fish become mature&#160; after about 1.5 years (WCPFC, 2019b). Size at first maturity is 40–55 cm Fork Length (FL), depending on the area (Collette and Nauen 1983, Matsumoto <em>et al</em>. 1984, Wild and Hampton 1994, Schaefer 2001). Estimated length at 50% maturity for females is 42–43 cm in the Atlantic and the Indian oceans (Cayre and Farrugio 1986, Stequert and Ramcharrun 1996, Collette and Graves 2019), and 47–56 cm, from southern to northern latitudes, in the Eastern Pacific Ocean (Schaefer and Fuller 2018). In the Western and Central Pacific Ocean, Skipjack mature at a length of around 50 cm FL (Ohashi <em>et al</em>. 2019, WCPFC 2019b).<br/><br/>Sex ratio is about 1:1 but fisheries that rely on young immature fish are dominated by females, while those that capture older fish are mostly male. This species spawns repeatedly, after reaching sexual maturity and with sufficient energy reserves, at sea surface temperatures of 24–30 °C: throughout the year in the Caribbean and other equatorial waters, and from spring to early fall in subtropical waters, with the spawning season becoming shorter as distance from the equator increases (Collette 2010). Batch fecundity increases with body length but is highly variable. Individual batch fecundity ranges from 80,000 eggs for a 44 cm female from Madagascar to 1.25 million eggs for a large (75 cm) female from the Seychelles Islands (Collette 2010, Collette and Graves, 2019). The estimated average batch fecundity, based on counts of late-stage migratory-nucleus or hydrated stages of oocytes from 129 fish from the eastern Pacific, was 296,475 oocytes, and the estimated mean relative fecundity was 54.9 oocytes per gram of body weight (Schaefer and Fuller 2018).<br/><br/>Maximum size recorded is 111 cm FL and 34.5 kg (Bayliff 1988, Garcia-Coll <em>et al</em>. 1986, Collette 2010, Collette and Graves 2019). The IGFA all-tackle gamefish record is a 45 lb, 4 oz. (20.54 kg) Skipjack caught over Flathead Bank in Baja California, Mexico in November 1996 (IGFA 2020).<br/><br/>Generation length for this species is estimated to be 3–4 years, following methods in Collette <em>et al</em>. 2011, and changes in population size are therefore estimated over 10 years.<br/><p><strong></strong></p><p></p>","Continued increases in purse-seine fleet capacities and targeting Skipjack within mixed species tuna aggregations associated with fish aggregating devices has resulted in increased catches of small Yellowfin and Bigeye Tunas, resulting in growth overfishing of both of the latter species in some management areas, and has also raised concerns about the sustainability of Skipjack catches (Collette and Graves 2019). In the tropical Pacific, increasingly El Niño-like conditions, including rising ocean temperatures, may lead to Skipjack shifting its distribution eastward and to higher latitudes, and be subject to a reduction in absolute biomass (Gilman <em>et al</em>. 2016). The current eastward extension (westward contraction) of Skipjack Tuna in the equatorial region during El Niño (La Niña) phases are caused by changes in temperature, prey and dissolved oxygen concentration (Lehodey <em>et al</em>. 2020).<br/><br/><strong>Eastern Pacific Ocean</strong><br/>Skipjack Tuna is not deemed to be overfished or subject to overfishing. However, recent catches are historically high and the substantial increase in numbers of sets on floating objects in recent years is concerning (ISSF 2020b).<br/><br/><strong>Western and Central Pacific Ocean<br/></strong>Recent fishing mortality does not exceed F<sub>MSY</sub> but fishing mortality is continuously increasing for both adults and juveniles (WCPFC 2019a).<br/><br/><strong>Indian Ocean<br/></strong>Skipjack Tuna appears to not be overfished or subject to overfishing (IOTC 2017a).<br/><br/><strong>Atlantic Ocean</strong><br/>Numerous changes have taken place in the Skipjack fishery since the early 1990s (e.g. the progressive use of FADs and the fishing area expanding latitudinally and westwards) and these have caused an increase in the catchability of Skipjack and in the proportion of exploited biomass. The main fisheries are the purse seine fisheries of Belize, Curaçao, EU-France, EU-Spain, Ghana, Guinea, Panama and Cabo Verde, followed by the baitboat fisheries of EU-Portugal, EU-Spain, Ghana and Senegal. Based on the preliminary 2017 catch estimate, catch has increased by 91% compared to the 2005–2009 average. In the Western Atlantic the main fishery is the Brazilian baitboat fishery, followed by the Venezuelan purse seine fleet. Estimation of ""faux poissons,""&#160; or the unreported catch of mixed, unidentifiable species, which is mainly composed of Skipjack should be improved to reduce uncertainty of the total Skipjack catches (ICCAT 2017).","Skipjack comprise about 60% of the commercial tuna catch worldwide and are mostly used for canning. As of 2014, global landings of Skipjack Tuna exceeded three million metric tonnes (mt), the third highest fisheries catch, exceeded only by Alaskan Pollack and Peruvian Anchovy. They are captured near the surface mostly with purse seine gear and increasingly in association with FADS (fish aggregating devices). They are also caught on pole-and-line gear, troll, handline, in gill nets, drift nets, longlines, and by recreational fishers.<br/><br/>Global catches of Skipjack Tuna increased from 165,000 metric tons (mt) in the 1950s, to over one million mt in the late 1980s, to over two million mt in the 2000s, and are currently in excess of three million mt. Skipjack stocks are assessed and managed by four recognized tuna regional fisheries management organizations (Collette and Graves 2019), in the Eastern Pacific, the Central and Western Pacific, Indian Ocean, and the Atlantic and Mediterranean Sea. <br/><br/>Two methods were used to estimate the change in population size for Skipjack within each management region over the last three generation lengths, or 10 years. In the first method (""method 1""), the change was calculated based on the linear per cent change in population size over the three generation lengths using approximately 3-year averages for the endpoints. In the second method (""method 2""), and to account for non-linear trends, the average annual per cent change in population size over the time period for which data are available was calculated, and then used to estimate the change in population size over the last three generation lengths, assuming an exponential decline. <br/><br/>Skipjack data for the Indian Ocean were extracted via digitization. To ensure annual data, prior to estimating changes in population size, where more than one data point existed for any given year, the average of those data points was taken. If, conversely, no data point corresponded to a year, we estimated that data point as the average of the preceding and following years. Data beyond annual catches for the Eastern Pacific, in the form of an adequate population abundance proxy, were unavailable and we therefore assumed zero change in population size. The same assumption was also made for the Eastern Atlantic due to the relative abundance index for the species exhibiting no consistent trend over the last 10 years.<br/><br/>In summary, based on stock-size weighted changes in B/B<sub>MSY</sub> or SSB/SSB<sub>0</sub> in the Western and Central Pacific, the Indian Ocean and the West Atlantic, and an assumed zero change elsewhere, there has been an estimated 2–24% decline globally over the past three generation lengths (10 years). Individual stocks were weighted by the average of the three highest historical catch estimates rather than MSY, as the latter is not known for all stocks. Details regarding these estimates are given below for each stock. In the majority of the Skipjack Tuna's range, the species is estimated to not be overfished and overfishing is not likely to be occurring.<br/><br/><strong>Eastern Pacific Ocean</strong><br/>Purse-seine catches account for most of the Skipjack Tuna landings in the Eastern Pacific. Catches were less than 50,000 mt until the late 1970s, increasing to an average of 130,000 mt in the late 1970s-early 1980s, followed by a 10-year period of about 70,000 mt, increasing again with the expansion of the floating object fisheries in the mid-1990s. Currently (2010–2019), the catches ranged between 150,000 and 350,000 mt, with the highest catches registered in 2019 (IATTC 2020). Skipjack recruitment in the Eastern Pacific region is highly variable and is thought to be the reason for the large variations in annual catches and apparent stock size (Maunder 2019, Collette and Graves 2019, IATTC 2020). The catch in 2018 was 288,636 mt (IATTC 2019).<br/><br/>Skipjack Tuna is notoriously a difficult species to assess. Detecting the effect of fishing on the population with standard fisheries data and stock assessment methods is difficult due to the species’ high and variable productivity (i.e. annual recruitment constitutes a large proportion of total biomass). This is especially true for the Eastern Pacific stock as a result of the lack of age-composition data, and in particular tagging data, which are needed for conventional stock assessments of Skipjack (Maunder 2019). Neither the biomass- nor fishing mortality-based reference points, nor the indicators that they are compared against, are available for Skipjack. Recent data- and model-based indicators are near its reference levels (IATTC 2020). Moreover, some fishery indicators are close to or in excess of historical reference levels, and the substantial increase in number of sets on floating objects in recent years is concerning (ISSF 2020a).<br/><br/>For the Eastern Pacific stock, productivity and susceptibility analysis for the tropical tuna fishery in the region indicated that Skipjack and Bigeye have about the same susceptibility to purse-seine fishing gear, and that Skipjack Tuna is much more productive than Bigeye Tuna (<em>Thunnus obesus</em>) (IATTC 2020). Biomass and the fishing mortality that corresponds to MSY (F<sub>MSY</sub>) are, respectively, negatively and positively correlated with productivity, while susceptibility is related to fishing mortality. Since Skipjack and Bigeye have about the same susceptibility, the status of Skipjack can be inferred from the status of Bigeye, based on the 2020 assessment that used a risk analysis approach. Thus, there is less than 50% probability that F<sub>MSY</sub> has been exceeded (P(F/F<sub>MSY</sub>)&gt;1) = 50%), and less than 53% probability that S<sub>cur</sub> is below the dynamic S<sub>MSY</sub> (P(S/S<sub>MSY</sub>_<sub>d</sub>)&lt;1 = 53%). Tagging data that may inform a stock assessment for Skipjack is currently being collected.<br/><br/>It is therefore assumed that the Skipjack population in the Eastern Pacific has remained more or less constant over the past 10 years, and the stock is not overfished or subject to overfishing (ISSF 2020b). Based on the three largest historical catch estimates in IATTC (2020), the Eastern Pacific represents about 10% of this species global population.<br/><br/><strong>Western and Central Pacific Ocean</strong><br/>The Western and Central Pacific Ocean is responsible for the greatest production of Skipjack Tuna throughout the world’s oceans.&#160; Landings, primarily by purse seine vessels, increased from under 350,000 mt in the 1960s, to over one million mt in 1990, and reached two million mt in the 2010s (Collette and Graves 2019). The total provisional catch in 2018 was 1,795,048 mt (WCPFC 2019a).<br/><br/>Based on the most recent (2019) stock assessment, Skipjack Tuna in the Western and Central Pacific is moderately exploited and the level of fishing mortality is sustainable. The stock is above the adopted Limit Reference Point and fished at less than F<sub>MSY</sub> rates with 100% probability. The median value of F<sub>recent</sub>/F<sub>MSY</sub> over the uncertainty grid of 54 models used to determine stock status is 0.45. The median SB<sub>recent</sub>/SB<sub>MSY</sub> is 2.58. The stock is therefore not overfished or subject to overfishing. However, fishing mortality is continuously increasing for both adults and juveniles, and spawning biomass is at its historically lowest level (WCPFC 2019a). <br/><br/>Based on median B/B<sub>MSY</sub> and using method 1, there has been an estimated 27% decline in the Western and Central Pacific population between 2008 and 2018, and 0% change using method 2. This stock is not overfished nor subject to overfishing (ISSF 2020b). Based on the three largest historical catch estimates in WCPFC (2019a), the Western and Central Pacific represents about 62% of this species global population.<br/><br/><strong>Indian Ocean</strong><br/>In the Indian Ocean, Skipjack are captured in a variety of fisheries, with the purse seine, gill net, drift nets, and pole and line fisheries each contributing between 20 and 35% of the landings which were 394,000 mt in 2015. Skipjack landings in the Indian Ocean reached 100,000 mt in the mid-1980s, exceeded 400,000 mt in the 2000s, peaking at 600,000 mt in the mid-2000s (Collette and Graves 2019). The catch in 2016 was 446,723 t (IOTC 2017a).<br/><br/>The 2017 stock assessment results are significantly different from the previous (2014 and 2011) assessments. The difference is mainly due to: (1) the correction of an error in small fish selectivity specification in the previous assessment; (2) the addition of tag-release mortality in the model; and (3) the assumption that effort creep is 1% per year since 1995 for the standardized European purse seine CPUE. The 2017 assessment indicates that the stock is at the target biomass reference point and that current and historical fishing mortality rates are below the target. Current spawning stock biomass relative to unexploited levels is 40%. On the weight of this and other evidence, Skipjack was determined to not be overfished or currently subject to overfishing (IOTC 2017a). <br/><br/>Based on the time series of median SSB/SSB<sub>0</sub> from the agreed Indian Ocean (IO) grid models presented in IOTC (2017b) and using method 1, there has been an estimated 36% decline in the Indian Ocean population between 2006 and 2016. Using method 2, the estimated decline is 12% over the past 10 years. However, in the Indian Ocean, Skipjack is not overfished nor subject to overfishing (ISSF 2020b). Based on the three largest historical catch estimates in IOTC (2017a), the Indian Ocean represents about 18% of this species global population.<br/><br/><strong>Atlantic Ocean and Mediterranean Sea</strong><br/>Skipjack are managed as two stocks in the Atlantic Ocean, with the eastern stock contributing about 85% of the landings. In total, Skipjack landings in the Atlantic gradually increased from over 100,000 mt in the 1970s to over 250,000 mt in the 2010s, with considerable year-to-year variation. Purse-seine catches account for more than 80% of Atlantic Skipjack landings overall, with baitboat catches representing a little less than 20% (Collette and Graves 2019). The Mediterranean is currently considered a separate stock. Catch has increased in the Mediterranean Sea in recent years, but statistics from this region are incomplete (Collette and Graves 2019). <br/><br/>The preliminary estimates of catches made in 2018 in the East Atlantic amounted to 282,427 t, which is an increase of about 85% as compared to the average of 2005–2009 (IATTC 2020). Relative biomass (B<sub>2013</sub>/B<sub>MSY</sub>) is likely greater than 1, and mortality due to fishing (F<sub>2013</sub>/F<sub>MSY</sub>) is likely less than 1. It is therefore unlikely that the stock in the Eastern Atlantic is overfished or that overfishing is occurring. It is, however, recommended that the catch and effort levels do not exceed the level of 2012–2013 catch or effort given the (1) lack of quantitative findings for the eastern stock assessment, and (2) pending additional data (including on FADs and on the ongoing Atlantic Tropical Tuna Tagging Program) being submitted which are needed to improve the stock assessment. The 2017 provisional catch (2018 catch) exceeds this level by 11% (27%). In addition, increasing harvests and fishing effort for Skipjack could cause involuntary consequences for other species that, in certain fisheries, are caught together with Skipjack (ICCAT 2017, 2020). According to ISSF (2020b), the Eastern Atlantic stock is not overfished and overfishing is not occurring.<br/><br/>The relative abundance index (scaled CPUE index) for the Eastern Atlantic Skipjack (ICCAT 2017) does not exhibit a consistent trend for the last 10 years of data (approx. 2002–2012). We therefore assumed zero change in population trends for that stock. The relative size of the stock was estimated by averaging the three highest historical catch estimates in ICCAT 2017 (p. 63, SKJ-Table 1). The data range from 1993 to 2017, but from SKJ-Figure 3 it can be seen that catches were less prior to 1993 (ICCAT 2017).<br/><br/>In the Western Atlantic, the 2017 preliminary catch estimate is 23,276 t (close to the 2018 estimate of 22,873 t). Relative biomass (B<sub>2013</sub>/B<sub>MSY</sub>) is probably close to 1.3 and mortality due to fishing (F<sub>2013</sub>/FMSY) is probably close to 0.7. The stock is determined not to be overfished or subject to overfishing. However, it is recommended that catches not exceed the MSY, currently around 30,000–32,000 t (ICCAT 2017). <br/><br/>In summary, based on B/B<sub>MSY</sub>, and using method 1, there has been an estimated 3% decline in the Western Atlantic between 2003 and 2013. Using method 2, the decline is 4% over the past 10 years. Both the Western Atlantic and Eastern Atlantic populations are not overfished nor subject to overfishing (ISSF 2020b). Based on the three largest historical catch estimates (ICCAT 2017, ICCAT 2014), the Western Atlantic represents about 2% of this species global population, and the Eastern Atlantic about 8% of its global population. Mediterranean Skipjack have not been assessed, due to lack of data.<br/><p></p><p></p>",Decreasing,"Skipjack Tuna are circumglobal in seas warmer than 15–18 °C. They are found throughout the warm Atlantic including the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean Sea. They are common in the eastern Atlantic including the Gulf of Guinea and the Mediterranean Sea but are absent from the Black Sea. They are widespread throughout the Indo-West Pacific. In the eastern Pacific, they have been reported from Gulf of Alaska to northern Chile, including waters of the oceanic islands (Collette and Graves 2019).",This species is extremely important in industrial commercial fisheries.,Marine,"Skipjack Tuna is listed as a highly migratory species in Annex I of the 1982 Convention on the Law of the Sea (FAO Fisheries Department 1994).<br/><br/>Stock assessments and reference points for Skipjack in the Eastern Pacific are highly uncertain. Developing alternative methods to assess and manage the species that are not sensitive to these uncertainties would therefore be beneficial (IATTC 2019), and indeed the IATTC recently concluded a large-scale conventional tagging program (V. Restrepo pers. comm., July 2020). The most comprehensive method to develop and test alternative assessment methods and management strategies would be full management strategy evaluation (MSE) for Skipjack. However, developing MSE is time-consuming and is yet to be conducted for Skipjack (IATTC 2019). The main conservation measure put in place by the IATTC are Resolutions C-17-01 and C-17-02, which includes an annual fishing closure for purse seine vessels with a carrying capacity in excess of 182 tons. This measure calls for, amongst other restrictions, limits on the number of active FADs purse seiners can have (ISSF 2020b).<br/><br/> In the Atlantic, the main binding ICCAT conservation measure is Recommendation 19-02, a multi-annual plan for tropical tunas. This plan prohibits purse seine and baitboat vessels fishing on floating objects,&#160;including their support vessels’ activities, in the high seas or EEZs during January-February (January–March in 2021). In addition, drifting FADs are not allowed to be deployed during the 15 days prior to the closure and there can be no more than 350 (300 in 2021) FADs with operational buoys at any one time per vessel (ISSF 2020b).<br/><br/>In the Western and Central Pacific there is an area-wide temporal closure on FAD sets, but the numbers of FAD sets has been increasing annually (Collette and Graves 2019), both here and potentially elsewhere in the species' range (V. Restrepo pers. comm., July 2020). No more than 350 FADs with activated instrumented buoys can be deployed at sea at any one time per purse seine vessel (ISSF 2020b).<br/><br/>In the Indian Ocean, Skipjack Tuna is not overfished or undergoing overfishing based on the most recent (2017) stock assessment. However, it can respond rapidly to ambient foraging conditions driven by ocean productivity because of its specific life history traits. There should be close monitoring of environmental indicators to inform on the potential increase/decrease in stock productivity (IOTC 2017a). IOTC has adopted an annual catch limit of 470,029 tonnes for Skipjack for the period 2018–2020 following application of the Harvest Control Rule in Resolution 16/02. A ban on discards of Skipjack, Bigeye and Yellowfin Tuna by purse seine vessels is established in Resolution 19/05 (ISSF 2020b).","",,false,false,Global

Based on stock-size weighted changes in biomass or spawning stock biomass relative to MSY or other indicators across all stocks, there has been estimated 3–19% decline globally over the past 20–25 years (three generation lengths; approximately 1993/1995–2016/2018). The largest stock decline, of up to 40% over three generation lengths (1993–2015) has occurred in the Mediterranean Sea, and is of concern. Additionally, between 20–40% declines are estimated to have occurred in the Indian Ocean over the past three generation lengths, where overfishing is occurring and which constitutes approximately 10% of the global population. As this species has a circumglobal distribution and a very large global population size, it does not meet any of the thresholds for criteria B, C or D, and criterion E cannot be applied because a quantitative analysis of future extinction probability is not available.&#160;However, with more than 90% of its global range in areas where overfishing is not occurring, and the species is not considered overfished, Albacore Tuna qualifies for consideration under criterion A1. Given the estimated 3–19% reduction over the past three generation lengths under criterion A1, this species is listed as Least Concern.","Albacore Tuna are a highly migratory, epipelagic and mesopelagic, oceanic species that is abundant in surface waters of 15.6–19.4 °C. Deeper swimming, larger Albacore are found in waters of 13.5–25.2 °C. Temperatures as low as 9.5 °C may be tolerated for short periods. Vertical movement behaviour can differ substantially between tropical and temperate latitudes (Williams <em>et al</em>. 2015). At tropical latitudes, Albacore showed a distinct diel pattern in vertical habitat use, occupying shallower warmer waters above the mixed layer at night, and deeper cooler waters below the mixed layer during the day. In contrast, there is little evidence of a diel pattern of vertical behaviour in Albacore at temperate latitudes, with fish limited to shallow waters above the mixed layer almost all the time. Albacore are known to concentrate along thermal discontinuities. They occasionally form mixed schools with Skipjack Tuna (<em>Katsuwonus pelamis</em>) and Yellowfin Tuna (<em>T. albacares</em>) in tropical waters.<br/><br/>Use of combined Japanese and US tagging data confirm the frequent westward movement of young Albacore and less frequent eastward movements in the North Pacific. This corresponds to Albacore life history where immature fish recruit into surface fisheries in the western and eastern Pacific and before maturing gradually move nearer to their spawning grounds in the central and western Pacific where they are vulnerable to deeper set longline gear (Ichinokawa <em>et al</em>. 2008). Details of migration in the Eastern North Pacific remain unclear, but juvenile fish (2- to 5-year-olds) are believed to move into the eastern Pacific Ocean in the spring and early summer, and return to the western and central Pacific, perhaps annually, in the late fall and winter, where they tend to remain as they mature (Collette and Graves 2019). Mediterranean Albacore is more accessible to fishing gears in spring and autumn, while small catches were noticed in the past in gillnets in early summer. The distribution of albacore juveniles in the Mediterranean is very poorly known.<br/><br/>Like other tunas, Albacore feed on a wide variety of fishes, squids, and crustaceans (Iverson 1962, Dragovich 1969, Collette and Graves, 2019). Albacore can reach up to 140 cm FL and 60 kg (Evano and Bourjea 2012). The International Game Fish Association (IGFA) all-tackle game fish record is of an 39.97 kg fish taken off of Gran Canaria, Canary Islands in November 1977 (IGFA 2020). <br/><br/>Immature Albacore (&lt;80 cm) generally have a sex ratio of 1:1, but males predominate in catches of mature fish. Spawning occurs in tropical and subtropical waters when sea surface temperatures are 24 °C or higher (Schaefer 2001). Spawning occurs over 7 months, from March to September, in tropical oceanic waters off Taiwan and the Philippines but is reduced to only three months in the Mediterranean, from June to August (Chen <em>et al</em>. 2010, Saber <em>et al</em>. 2015). Like other tunas, Albacore are batch spawners with asynchronous egg development and indeterminate annual fecundity. Fecundity increases with size, but there is no clear correlation between fork length and ovary weight and number of eggs. In the western Indian Ocean, Albacore spawn on the average every 1.7–2.2 days during the spawning season from November to January (Chen <em>et al</em>. 2010, Dhurmeea <em>et al</em>. 2016), in the South Pacific every 1.3 days during peak spawning from October to December (Farley <em>et al</em>. 2013b), but may spawn daily in the Mediterranean (Saber <em>et al</em>. 2015, Collette and Graves 2019). A 20 kg female may produce between two and three million eggs per season, released in at least two batches (Collette 2010).<br/><br/>Albacore mature relatively late and at a larger size compared to other tunas. Age of first maturity is estimated to be between two and five years. Estimates of length at 50% maturity are around 90 cm FL in all oceans except the Mediterranean Sea where it is smaller (Wu and Kuo 1993, Ramon and Bailey 1996, Farley <em>et al</em>. 2014, Nikolic <em>et al</em>. 2017a). In the South Pacific, the length at 50% maturity is about 87 cm FL at an estimated age of 4.5 years (Farley <em>et al</em>. 2014) while in the western Indian Ocean the length at 50% maturity for female albacore was 85.3 cm FL (Dhurmeea <em>et al</em>. 2016). Maturity appears to occur earlier for Albacore in the Mediterranean, with a minimum size at first maturity for females of 56 cm FL at an age of 2 years (Saber <em>et al</em>. 2015, Collette and Graves, 2019). Compared to other tunas, Albacore appear to be relatively long-lived. A 128 cm FL fish from the North Pacific was determined to be 15 years, slightly older than estimates obtained from other Albacore age and growth studies (Chen <em>et al</em>. 2012, Farley <em>et al</em>. 2013a, Wells <em>et al</em>. 2013, Collette and Graves 2019). <br/><br/>Generation length is not well known for Albacore, but may be 8–10 years (Collette and Graves 2019). Previously, generation length was estimated to be 6–7 years, based on age-structured data from the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans (Collette <em>et al</em>. 2001). For this assessment, a midpoint estimate of 7–8 years has been adopted to represent generation length.<br/><p></p>","Albacore are mainly marketed as canned white meat tuna, among the most expensive canned tuna. They are caught with six main types of gear: pole-and-line, longline, gillnet, troll, purse-seine, and mid-water trawl (Nikolic <em>et al</em>. 2017a). Longline caught Albacore is mostly used for sashimi and sushi in recent years. The driftnet fishery for Albacore has been banned since 2002 in the EC countries and from 2004 in all the ICCAT Mediterranean countries, but it is known that illegal fishing activity still occurs in some areas (Collette and Graves 2019). The Indian Ocean stock, which accounts for about 11% of the global population based on MSY (ISSF 2020a), is experiencing overfishing.","Albacore Tuna is one of the principal market species of the tuna fisheries worldwide, representing 5% of the total tuna catch in 2015 (ISSF 2017). Small juveniles (50–90 cm FL) are generally taken with surface gear (pole-and-line and trolling) in temperate latitudes. Large adult fish (90–140 cm FL) are predominantly taken with longlines in tropical and subtropical waters, and by longlines and occasionally by troll lines in the Mediterranean Sea. Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) worldwide reported landings show a steady increase from 103,676 metric tons (mt) in 1950 to over 200,000 mt in 1971. Catches have generally fluctuated between 200,000 and 250,000 mt since that time (FAO, ISSF 2017, Collette and Graves 2019, Pew 2020).<br/><br/>Six major stocks of Albacore are recognized: North and South Atlantic, Mediterranean Sea, North and South Pacific, and Indian Ocean. There is substantial genetic evidence supporting the six stocks, and each is managed separately (Davies <em>et al</em>. 2011, Montes <em>et al</em>. 2012, Nikolic <em>et al</em>. 2017a). However, alternate hypotheses of stock structure have been suggested including four genetically homogenous populations (Mediterranean Sea, Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific Oceans (Albania <em>et al</em>. 2013, Laconcha <em>et al</em>. 2015). Analysis of molecular data is consistent with a lack of migration or gene flow from the Atlantic to the Mediterranean Albacore population (Viñas <em>et al</em>. 2004, Nakadate <em>et al</em>. 2005). Genetic heterogeneity has been reported within the Mediterranean even though there are no pronounced oceanographic barriers that might limit gene flow there (Montes <em>et al</em>. 2012, Collette and Graves 2019).<br/><br/>Two methods were used to estimate the change in population size in each individual stock over the last three generation lengths, or 20 to 25 years. In the first method (""method 1""), the change is calculated based on the linear percent change in population size over the three generation lengths using approximately 3-year averages for the endpoints. In the second method (""method 2""), the average annual percent change in population size over the time period for which data are available is calculated, and used to estimate the change in population size over the last three generation lengths assuming an exponential decline (North Pacific Ocean: 1994, 1994–2018; South Pacific Ocean: 1960, 1992–2016; Indian Ocean: 1950, 1994–2017; North Atlantic Ocean: 1930, 1995–2019; South Atlantic Ocean: 1956, 1994–2018; Mediterranean: 1980, 1993–2015). <br/><br/>In summary, based on stock-size weighted changes in B/B<sub>MSY</sub>, SSB/SSB<sub>MSY</sub> or SSB/20%SSB<sub>current</sub>, there has been an estimated 3–19% decline globally over the past 20 to 25 years (three generation lengths). To account for differences in stock size, declines for individual stocks were weighted by their MSY (ISSF 2020a). However, except for the Indian Ocean where overfishing may be occurring, all stocks currently are not overfished, nor experiencing overfishing.<br/><br/><strong>North Pacific Ocean</strong><br/>North Pacific Albacore support one of the most valuable tuna fisheries in the eastern Pacific. Currently, the main nations fishing in this area are Japan and the United States. Historically, the Japanese fishery has historically harvested the largest percentage (about 72%) while the US fisheries are responsible for most of the remaining harvest. The main fishing gears are longline (39%), and pole-and-line (37%) followed by trolling (22%). Catches by longlining have shown a decreasing trend since 1997 (Collette and Graves 2019). In 2019, catches were about 65,100 t, an increase of 13% from 2018 (ISSF 2020b).<br/><br/>Based on SSB/20%SSB<sub>current</sub>, F=0, with 20%SSB<sub>current</sub>, F=0 being the limit reference point adopted by the WCPFC from the base case model (WCPFC 2020), the North Pacific Ocean stock is estimated to have declined by 23% between 1994 and 2018 using method 1, and by 14% over the last three generation lengths, using method 2. Based on MSY, the North Pacific stock is estimated to be approximately 40% of the Albacore Tuna's global population. However, the North Pacific stock is likely not overfished nor subject to overfishing (WCPFC 2020, ISSF 2020b).<br/><br/><strong>South Pacific Ocean</strong><br/>Taiwan, China, and Fiji are the major nations fishing for Albacore in the South Pacific. Albacore catches in this region increased from approximately 40,000 metric tons (mt) in the late 1960s and early 1970s to 80,000 mt by 2009. The catch of 68,600 mt in 2016 is similar to that of 2015 (ISSF 2017). The main fishing gear is longline, which accounts for 96% of the catch (Collette and Graves 2019), however there has been significant drift gillnet catch in the past.<br/><br/>Based on median B/B<sub>MSY</sub> (WCPFC 2019b), the South Pacific Ocean stock is estimated to have declined by less than 3% between 1992 and 2016 using method 1, and declined by 23% over the last three generation lengths using method 2. Based on MSY, the South Pacific stock is estimated to be approximately 30% of this species global population. However, the South Pacific stock is not overfished nor subject to overfishing (ISSF 2020b), but is below its target reference point of 56%SSBF=0.<br/><br/><strong>Indian Ocean</strong><br/>Currently, Taiwan is the main nation fishing for Albacore in the Indian Ocean. Catches of Albacore in the Indian Ocean gradually increased from 20,000 mt in the early 1990s and have fluctuated between 25,000 and 40,000 mt for the past 30 years. Catches have almost exclusively been made by longline except for a period from 1980 to 1995 when drift gillnets accounted for as much as a third of the catches (Nikolic <em>et al</em>. 2017, Collette and Graves 2019).<br/><br/>Based on the stock synthesis for SSB/SSB<sub>MSY</sub> (IOTC 2019), the Indian Ocean stock is estimated to have declined by 33% between 1994 and 2017 using method 1, and 35% over three generation lengths using method 2. However, the based on MSY, the Indian Ocean stock is estimated to be approximately 10% of this species global population. The Indian Ocean stock is not overfished, but is subject to overfishing (ISSF 2020b).<br/><br/><strong>North Atlantic Ocean</strong><br/>The main nations fishing in the North Atlantic are Spain, France, Ireland and Taiwan. Catches of North Atlantic Albacore are primarily made by pole-and-line (35%), trolling (28%), trawlers (17%) and longline (17%). Catches of northern Albacore peaked at 65,000 mt in the mid-1960s, declined to a low of 15,375 mt in 2009, and then climbed back to 30,340 mt in 2016, going to 29,691 mt. Surface fisheries concentrate mainly in the Bay of Biscay and around the Azores and Canary Islands during summer and fall, taking young fish while longline vessels operate throughout the Atlantic year-round and target larger fish (Collette and Graves 2019, ICCAT 2020).<br/><br/>Based on B/B<sub>MSY</sub> from the ICCAT (2020) mpb Reference Case model, the North Atlantic stock is estimated to have increased by at least 70% between 1995 and 2019 using method 1, and decreased by 17% using method 2 over the past three generation lengths. However, the based on MSY, the North Atlantic stock is estimated to be approximately 10% of this species global population. The North Atlantic stock is not overfished and overfishing is not occurring (ISSF 2020b, ICCAT 2020).<br/><br/><strong>South Atlantic Ocean</strong><br/>Currently, the main nations fishing in the South Atlantic are longliners from Taiwan (58%), and pole-and-line vessels from South Africa (17%) and Namibia (6%). Surface fisheries operate mainly between October and May, capturing juvenile and subadult fish. Catches have varied from a high of 41,000 mt in 1987 to a low of about 13,702 mt in 2016, a 10% decrease from 2015. Recently, catches have been increasing, reaching 17,098 mt in 2018 (ISSF 2017, Collette and Graves 2019, ICCAT 2020).<br/><br/>Based on the median B/B<sub>MSY</sub> from the JABBA base case model (ICCAT 2020) for the South Atlantic stock is estimated to have stayed increased about 40% between 1994 and 2018 using method 1, and decreased by 19% over three generation lengths using method 2. However, the based on MSY, the South Atlantic stock is estimated to be less than 8% of this species global population. Further, this stock is not overfished and overfishing is not occurring (ISSF 2020b, ICCAT, 2020).<br/><br/><strong>Mediterranean</strong><br/>Albacore are caught by a number of Mediterranean fleets, including those of Cyprus, Italy, Greece, Spain, and Malta. Longline is the primary gear, but catches are also made using troll lines, rod and reel, purse-seines and a variety of gears; until 2002, important catches were also made by driftnets and a few fleets reported some gillnet catches until 2010. Reported catches have been increasing, but there is a lack of reporting from some fisheries. Reported Albacore catches in the Mediterranean since 1982 have fluctuated between 1,235 mt in 1983 and 7,898 mt in 2003. In the last 10 years (2009–2018), catches ranged between a minimum of 1,503 mt in 2015 and a maximum of 4,628 mt in 2011, reaching 2,434 mt in 2018. The prohibition to access some important fishing grounds (i.e. Libya) may have negatively biased the fishing data coherence over the last ten years (Collette and Graves 2019, ICCAT 2020).<br/><br/>Based on the base case JABBA model for B/B<sub>MSY</sub> (ICCAT 2017), the Mediterranean stock is estimated to have declined by 45% between 1993 and 2015 using method 1, and 40% over three generation lengths using method 2. The fishing area limitations may have affected the latest CPUE series and therefore the results. Based on MSY, the Mediterranean stock is estimated to be less than 2% of this species global population. The Mediterranean stock is not overfished but is near the MSY level, and overfishing is probably not occurring (ISSF 2020b, ICCAT 2020).",Decreasing,"Albacore Tuna are cosmopolitan in tropical and temperate waters of all the oceans, including the Mediterranean Sea, but they are not found in surface waters between 10°N and 10°S. In the Atlantic, this species is widely distributed between 60°N and 50°S. Albacore distribution in the western Pacific extends in a broad band between 40°N and 40°S, and continues across to the eastern Pacific where it separates into two branches. The northern branch extends from British Columbia to the tip of Baja California, and the southern branch extends from southern Peru to southern Chile (Collette and Graves 2019).","An important fishery exists for this species globally, which product is mainly marketed as canned white meat tuna. The global end value of commercial albacore fisheries was $2.1 billion in 2018 (Pew 2020).",Marine,"This species is listed as a highly migratory species in Annex I of the 1982 Convention on the Law of the Sea (FAO Fisheries Department 1994).<br/><br/>In the North Atlantic, Albacore were overfished in the early 2000s, but ICCAT adopted a rebuilding plan that reduced TACs for several years, allowing the spawning stock biomass to recover. The stock is now managed with a harvest control rule, including quota allocations for the major harvesters and a landings cap of 215 mt for minor harvesters. In the South Atlantic, the Albacore stock was considered to be overfished in the late 1990s, but stock status has been improving (ISSF 2017). Current management measures include catch limits for major harvesters, with others restricted to catches of no more than 25 mt. In the Mediterranean Sea, management measures adopted by ICCAT include limits on vessel numbers and a two-month closed period for the fishery that coincides with a seasonal closure of the Mediterranean swordfish fishery. In the North Pacific, WCPFC management measures adopted in 2019 calls to not increase effort beyond current levels and to limit vessels fishing for North Pacific Albacore to the 2002–2004 average. In the South Pacific, the WCPFC adopted a management measure to limit vessels fishing for South Pacific Albacore to the number fishing in 2005, or the 2000–2004 average. A plan is under development to rebuild the stock to its target reference point. In the Indian Ocean, no conservation and management measures have been adopted by the IOTC (Collette and Graves 2019). Management procedures are under development for all Albacore stocks, except in the Mediterranean.","",,false,false,Global

However, overfishing is occurring in approximately 40% of this species' global range, with estimated declines of at least 20% in the Western and Central Pacific and Eastern Pacific, and up to 40% in the Atlantic and Indian Ocean stocks over the past three generation lengths (21 years). Based stock declines estimated from trends in spawning biomass ratio, spawning stock biomass or B/B<sub>MSY</sub> and weighted by stock-size (MSY), there has been an estimated 29–32% decline globally of Bigeye Tuna over the past three generation lengths (approximately 1996 to 2018). Therefore, this species is listed as Vulnerable under Criterion A2.","This pelagic and oceanodromous species occurs in waters with temperatures ranging from 13 °C to 29 °C, but the optimum is between 17 °C and 22 °C. Variation in occurrence is closely related to seasonal and climatic changes in surface temperature and thermocline. Unassociated Bigeye tuna schools are typically found above the mixed layer depth during the night, and during the day they spend most of their time undertaking dives to 250-500 m for prolonged periods targeting deep scattering prey organisms. Schools of Bigeye associated with FADs are commonly found in aggregations with Skipjack tuna and sometimes Yellowfin tuna dependent on the area. When associated with FADs, they remain most of the time above the mixed layer depth (Dagorn <em>et al</em>. 2000, Schaefer and Fuller 2002, Evans <em>et al</em>. 2008). Deep diving events in excess of 500 m are not uncommon, averaging close to 1,000 m, with a maximum recorded depth of 1,902 m at a temperature of about 3 °C (Schaefer and Fuller 2010, Collette and Graves 2019).<br/><br/>This species feeds on a wide variety of fishes, cephalopods and crustaceans during the day and at night. Food studies in the Atlantic were reviewed by Dragovich (1969). Large juveniles and adults exploit the deep scattering layer, consuming mesopelagic fishes, cephalopods, and crustaceans at depths to 300–500 m during the day, and in surface waters at night (Dagorn <em>et al</em>. 2000, Schaefer and Fuller 2010, Vaske <em>et al</em>. 2012). Off northeastern Brazil, 83 prey items were found in stomachs of Bigeye Tuna, of which 46 were fishes, mostly epipelagic or mesopelagic species, 20 were cephalopods, and 13 were pelagic crustaceans (Vaske <em>et al</em>. 2012). The Caribbean Pomfret (<em>Brama caribbea</em>) was the most important food item followed by other mesopelagic fishes and a squid (<em>Ornithoteuthis antillarum</em>) was the most preyed-on cephalopod.&#160;<span id=""docs-internal-guid-7f520416-7fff-87df-c7f0-baebcef46941"">In the western Indian Ocean, Bigeye Tuna switch from eating lanternfishes and crustaceans to fishes such as lancetfishes, Alepisauridae as they grow (Lin <em>et al</em>. 2020).<span><br/><br/>This species is a multiple spawner that may spawn every one or two days over several months (Nikaido <em>et al</em>. 1992).&#160;They spawn over periods of the full moon, and spawn throughout the year, at least in the western Pacific (Sun <em>et al</em>. 2013, Collette and Graves 2019).&#160;Although spawning apparently occurs widely across the equatorial Pacific Ocean, the greatest reproductive potential appears to be in the eastern Pacific, based on apparent maturation, size frequencies, and catch per unit of effort (Kikawa 1966).&#160;In the eastern and central Pacific, spawning has been recorded between 15°N&#160;and 15°S and between 105°&#160;and 175°W during most months when sea surface temperatures exceeded 24 °C with a peak from April through September in the northern hemisphere and between January and March in the southern hemisphere. Spawning is primarily at night between 1900 and 0400 hr. The average mature female spawned every 2.6 days. The estimated mean relative fecundity is 24 oocytes/g body weight. The number of eggs per spawning has been estimated at 2.9–6.3 million (Fritzsche 1978, Miyabe 1994, Schaefer 2001, Schaefer <em>et al</em>. 2005, Farley <em>et al</em>. 2006, Collette and Graves 2019).&#160;Eggs and larvae are pelagic (Kailola <em>et al</em>. 1993).<br/><span><span><br/>The IGFA all-tackle game fish record for Bigeye Tuna is 236 cm FL, 197.3 kg caught in the Pacific Ocean off Cabo Blanco, Peru, in April 1957. The all-tackle record for the Atlantic is a 178 kg fish caught in the Canary Islands in July 1996 (IGFA 2020).&#160;<span><span>Longevity for this species may vary by region. Estimated maximum age for this species in the Western Pacific is 16 years (Farley <em>et al.</em> 2006), in the Indian Ocean it is 8 years (Tankevich 1982), in the Atlantic Ocean it is 9 to 17 years (Hallier <em>et al</em>. 2005, Andrews <em>et al</em>. 2020), and in the Eastern Pacific is 15 years (K. Schaefer, pers. comm., February 2021). There appears to be geographic variation in length&#160;at 50% maturity based on estimates of 102–135 cm (approximately 3.5 years of age) from different regions of the Pacific Ocean (Schaefer <em>et al</em>. 2005, Zhu <em>et al</em>. 2010, Sun <em>et al</em>. 2013, Collette and Graves 2019).&#160;Males tend to dominate the catches over the entire size range (Collette 2010).<br/><br/>Previously, the generation length for this species was estimated to be between 4.4 and 5 years based on age structure data across different stocks (Collette <em>et al</em>. 2011).

Bait boats and other gear types also account for minor landings (Collette and Graves, 2019).<br/><br/>The 2017 stock assessment conclusion in WCPFC (2019) (based on spawning biomass relative to the biomass limit reference point rather than SSB<sub>recent</sub>/SSB<sub>MSY</sub>) was that Bigeye Tuna in the Central and Western Pacific appeared not to be experiencing overfishing or to be in an overfished condition. However, the inclusion of new information on Bigeye Tuna growth and regional structures indicates that the amount of uncertainty in the stock status results is higher than for the previous assessment. Fishery impact is highest in the tropical region, with particularly high fishing mortality on juvenile bigeye tuna (WCPFC 2019).<br/><br/>In the Atlantic, Bigeye Tuna is currently overfished and is undergoing overfishing. The current MSY may be less than the MSY achieved in past decades due to overall selectivity shifting to smaller fish. There has been a long-term increase in SSB<sub>MSY</sub> and a general long term decrease in MSY (ICCAT 2018a).<br/><br/>The bigeye stock in the Eastern Pacific is not overfished and overfishing is not occurring. However, SSB is likely around SSB<sub>MSY</sub> and F around F<sub>MSY</sub> (ISSF 2020). In the Indian Ocean, the stock is not overfished but overfishing is occurring and spawning stock biomass in 2018 was 31% of the unfished levels (IOTC 2019a).","Samples of Bigeye Tuna from the Atlantic Ocean are genetically distinct from those found in the Indian and Pacific Oceans (Alvarado Bremer <em>et al</em>. 1998, Chow <em>et al</em>. 2000). Two highly divergent mitochondrial haplotype clades coexist in the Atlantic Ocean (Martínez <em>et al</em>. 2006). One is almost exclusively confined to the Atlantic Ocean while the other is also found in the Indo-Pacific. Genetic studies have shown no population structuring within the Indian Ocean (Appleyard <em>et al</em>. 2002, Chiang <em>et al</em>. 2008). For management purposes, four stocks of Bigeye Tuna are recognized: Atlantic Ocean, eastern Pacific Ocean, western and central Pacific Ocean, and Indian Ocean. Results from tagging studies demonstrate that a small fraction (~5%) of individuals undertake large (&gt;1,500 km) displacements (which could facilitate some gene flow), but most individuals remained within the general area in which they were tagged. Based on tagging data, as many as nine ecological stocks have been proposed for the Pacific Ocean (Schaefer <em>et al</em>. 2015).<br/><br/>Global catches of Bigeye Tuna were less than 100,000 mt through the 1960s, increased to about 200,000 mt by 1980, and then quickly rose, peaking at over 500,000 mt in 1998. Current catches have been close to 400,000 mt. Bigeye Tuna are caught primarily by pelagic longlines in targeted catch as well as purse seines, with minor landings from bait boats and other gear types. Pelagic longlines accounted for most of the catches until the 1990s, at which time purse seine catches began to steadily increase (Collette and Graves 2019). Purse seines now account for than half of the catch (Pew 2020). Pelagic longlines typically catch medium to large Bigeye Tuna, while the purse seine fishery typically catches small to medium size fish, that often form mixed schools with Skipjack and Yellowfin Tuna associated with FADs. With increases in purse seine fishing effort, there has been a change in the overall selectivity of the fishery, resulting in lower MSYs (Collette and Graves 2019).<br/><br/>Two methods were used to estimate decline. In the first method (""method 1""), the linear percent change in population size over the last 21 years (three generation lengths) was calculated using approximately 3-year averages for the endpoints. In the second method (""method 2"") that better accounts for non-linear trends, the average annual percent change in population size over the time period for which data are available is calculated, and used to estimate the change in population size over the last 3 generation lengths, assuming an exponential decline. Data for the Eastern Pacific, Atlantic and Indian Oceans were extracted via digitization. To ensure annual data, prior to estimating changes in population size, where more than 1 data point existed for any given year, the average of those data points was taken. If conversely no data point corresponded to a year, we estimated that data point as the average of the preceding and following years.<br/><br/>In summary, based on stock-size weighted changes in B/B<sub>MSY</sub>, SBR, or SSB across this species' global range, there has been an estimated 29–32% decline over the past three generation lengths. To account for differences in stock size, declines for individual stocks were weighted by their MSY (ISSF 2020). In at least 40% of its range, in the Indian Ocean and the Atlantic Ocean, this species is considered overfished and/or overfishing is occurring (ISSF 2020).<br/><br/><strong>Eastern Pacific Ocean</strong> <br/>Catches of Bigeye Tuna by pelagic longline vessels in the eastern Pacific increased in the 1950s, reaching more than 60,000 mt by the early 1960s, and peaked at close to 148,000 mt in 2000. While there were some modest catches by purse seine vessels from the mid 1970s to the mid 1980s, catches by this gear type increased dramatically through the 1990s, peaking at about 100,000 mt in 2000. Currently, purse seines account for about 74% of the landings, and pelagic longlines take the other 26%. The change in selectivity of the fishery to smaller fish has resulted in a decrease to the MSY of almost 50%.&#160; In 2019 the total catch was 95,100 mt, close to the five year average of about 98,000 mt. In 2019, it was 95,192 mt (Collette and Graves 2019, IATTC 2020).<br/><br/>Since 1993, there has been, on average, a substantial increase in the fishing mortality of bigeye 2 year-olds and younger. This increase was due to the expansion of the purse-seine fisheries that catch tuna in association with fish aggregating devices (FADs). According to the 2020 assessment, which used a risk analysis approach and 44 reference models, there is a 50% chance that the recent fishing mortality rates are above the level corresponding to MSY and a 53% chance that the recent spawning biomasses are lower than the level corresponding to the dynamic MSY (S<sub>MSY_d</sub>). <br/><br/>Based on both the pessimistic and optimistic estimates of spawning stock biomass (SSB) (IATTC 2020) and using method 1, the estimated decline in the Eastern Pacific stock population between 2000 and 2019 is between 14 and 31%. Using method 2, the estimated decline is between 18 and 20% over the past 21 years (three generation lengths). Based on MSY, the Eastern Pacific stock is estimated to be approximately 22 % of this species global population. In terms of overfishing, spawning biomass has likely been fluctuating around the MSY level and F has probably fluctuated around F<sub>MSY</sub> (ISSF 2020).<br/><br/><strong>Western and Central Pacific Ocean</strong><br/>Catches of Bigeye Tuna in the western and central Pacific steadily increased from the 1950s through a peak in the early 2000s, and have averaged about 149,000 mt over the past five years. Pelagic longlines accounted for the majority of the catch through the mid-2000s, but since that time longline catches have dropped by about 25,000 mt. The purse seine fishery increased dramatically through the 1980s and 1990s, and now has catches comparable to those of the pelagic longline fleet. Each accounts for about 44% of the total catch. Due to a change in selectivity of the fishery resulting from increased catches of small fish by the purse seine fleet, the current MSY is less than half of that prior to the 1970s (Collette and Graves 2019). Total catch in 2018 was 145,402 mt (WCPFC 2019).<br/><br/>Compared to the previous (2014) assessment, the best available information on the 2017 WCPO Bigeye Tuna stock status indicates that the stock status condition is more positive with a central tendency for SB<sub>recent</sub>/SB<sub>F</sub>=0 that is now higher and a Frecent/F<sub>MSY</sub> that is lower. However, the status of the stock in 2017 is also much more uncertain due to more comprehensive technical treatment of structural uncertainty through the use of the model uncertainty grid. The positive changes are mainly caused by three factors: the inclusion of new growth curve information, the inclusion of a new regional assessment structure, and estimated increases in recruitment in recent years. In regards to the latter, it is not clear whether the improvement is caused by positive oceanographic conditions, effective management measures to conserve spawning biomass, some of combination of both, or other factors. The median SSB<sub>recent</sub>/SSB<sub>MSY</sub> under the selected new and old growth curve model weightings is 1.23 while the median F<sub>recent</sub>/F<sub>MSY</sub> is 0.83. The assessment results also show that, irrespective of the uncertainty grid used, except for the small recent increase, the Western and Central Pacific stock has been decreasing continuously for the past 60 years. In agreement with previous assessments, there has been a long-term increase in fishing mortality for both juvenile and adult Bigeye Tuna and a long-term decrease in spawning biomass from the 1950s to the present (WCPFC 2019).<br/><br/>Based on the median B/B<sub>MSY</sub> from the 2018 WCPFC assessment update and using method 1, there has been a 28% decrease in the Western and Central Pacific Ocean population between 1994 and 2015. Using method 2, the estimated decline is 22% over the past 21 years, or three generation lengths. Based on MSY, the Western and Central Pacific stock is estimated to be approximately 38% of this species global population. Based on the SPC's 2020 stock assessment, SSB/SSB<sub>MSY</sub> = 1.83, indicating that the western and central Pacific ocean stock is not overfished, and F/F<sub>MSY</sub> = 0.72 indicating that overfishing is likely not occurring (ISSF 2020).<br/><br/><strong>Indian Ocean </strong><br/>Catches of Bigeye Tuna in the Indian Ocean increased steadily from the 1950s, reaching a maximum of more than 150,000 mt in the late 1990s. Pelagic longline has been the dominant gear type throughout, although the overall share has decreased since the early 2000s. Pelagic longlines now account for about 54% of the catches, purse seines 28% and other gear types 18%. Longline catches decreased significantly after the early 2000s, largely due to a shift in the location of the fishery to avoid piracy (Collette and Graves 2019). <br/><br/>The 2018 catch reported in the most recent (2019) stock assessment was 93,515 mt. However, due to concerns on the reported catch data for 2018, the stock status was based on SS3 model formulations using the best catch estimate by the Scientific Committee. Relative to the unfished levels in 2018 and the level that can support MSY, spawning stock biomass in 2018 was estimated to be 31% and 122% respectively. The 2019 assessment outcome is qualitatively different to the 2016 stock assessment due to increased small size catch, changes in modelling assumptions about longline selectivity, and the abundance index developed in 2019. It is estimated that SSB<sub>2018</sub> is above SSB<sub>MSY</sub> and fishing mortality above F<sub>MSY</sub>, both with high probability (IOTC 2019a).<br/><br/>Based on the median of the spawning biomass predicted by the 18 models of the final grid used to produce management advice per IOTC (2019b), and using method 1,&#160; there has been an estimated 46% decrease in the Indian Ocean population between 1996 and 2017. Using the method 2, the population is estimated to have declined by 42% over the past 21 years or three generation lengths. Based on MSY, the Indian Ocean stock is estimated to be approximately 20% of this species global population. According to ISSF (2020) and IOTC (2020), the Indian Ocean stock is not overfished, but overfishing is currently occurring.<br/><br/><strong>Atlantic Ocean</strong>&#160;&#160; &#160;<br/>Bigeye Tuna catches in the Atlantic Ocean increased steadily from the 1960s, reaching a maximum of almost 135,000 mt in 1994. Catches over the past five years have been about 76,000 mt. The pelagic longline has been the dominant gear type, and even though longline catches decreased by more than half since they peaked at just over 80,000 mt in the mid 1990s, this gear type still accounts for 47% of the landings. Purse seine effort increased dramatically in the 1990s and currently accounts for 37% of the landings, while traditional bait boat fisheries produce 13% of the catch (Collette and Graves 2019). Historical estimates show large declines in biomass and increases in fishing mortality, especially in the mid 1990s when fishing mortality exceeded F<sub>MSY</sub> for several years.<br/><br/>The results of the most recent (2018) stock assessment are less uncertain than previous assessment results and this is attributed to the use of an improved joint longline (LL) index, the confirmation that catches continue to exceed TACs, and the use of just one model platform to provide management advice. Based on the combined result of SS318 uncertainty grid in the 2018 stock assessment, relative fishing mortality (F<sub>2017</sub>/F<sub>MSY</sub>) in the Atlantic is 1.63. The relative spawning biomass (SSB<sub>2017</sub>/SSB<sub>MSY</sub>) is 0.59.<br/><br/>Based on median of SS3-uncertainty grid SSB estimates (across all 18 runs) (ICCAT 2018b), and using method 1, there has been an estimated 43% decrease in the Atlantic population between 1996 and 2017. Using method 2, the population is estimated to have decreased by 41% over the past 21 years (three generation lengths). Based on MSY, the Atlantic Ocean stock is estimated to be approximately 20% of this species global population. According to ISSF (2020), the stock is overfished and overfishing is occurring.",Decreasing,"Bigeye Tuna are circumglobal in tropical and temperate seas, but have never been reported from the Mediterranean Sea. They occur as far north as 55–60° in the northern summer and as far south as 45–50° in the austral summer, but young fish and reproductively active fish primarily occur in tropical waters. There are three British records, all in relatively warm waters in the southwest, the most northerly in Wales at 51°40’N, 4°15’W from August 2006 (Powell <em>et al</em>. 2009, Collette and Graves 2019).","This species is an extremely valuable fishery resource, especially for sashimi markets and canneries to a lesser extent. It had an end value of $4.3 billion in 2018. The fish taken in the purse seine fishery are typically destined for canneries, while the larger fish from the pelagic longline fishery mainly enter the sashimi market (Collette and Graves 2019, Pew 2020).",Marine,"This species is listed as a highly migratory species in Annex I of the 1982 Convention on the Law of the Sea (FAO Fisheries Department 1994). Increased catches of small Bigeye Tuna by purse seines fishing on FADs has resulted in a large change in the size selectivity of the fishery and decreased yields per recruit in all areas.&#160; In some ocean basins, the estimated MSY has dropped by 50% due to the change in selectivity of the fishery, and longline catches of larger fish have declined. Management of the catches of small fish is complicated by that fact that small Bigeye Tuna co-school with small Yellowfin Tuna and Skipjack under FADs. To date, the tuna RFMOs have had difficulty effectively managing the purse seine fishery, and achieving an acceptable balance between the purse seine and longline fisheries (Collette and Graves 2019).<br/><br/><strong>Atlantic Ocean</strong><br/>In the most recent stock assessment, the Bigeye Tuna stock was estimated to be overfished and that overfishing was occurring in 2017 (ICCAT 2018a). The 2015 assessment also indicated that the stock was overfished (SSB = 0.67 SSB<sub>MSY</sub>), and that over fishing was occurring (F = 1.28 F<sub>MSY</sub>), in contrast to the relatively optimistic assessments prior to and including the 2010 assessment. MSY has decreased over time due to a changing selectivity of the fishery resulting from increased catches of small fish by purse seines fishing on FADs (Collette and Graves 2019). Following ICCAT Recommendation 19-01, there are now catch limits for all parties. TAC is 62.5 for 2020 and 61.5 for 2021. An Atlantic-wide closure on FAD fishing was established for January and February 2020, and January to March 2021. There are also limits on the number of FADs per vessel and many control measures (J. Graves, pers. comm. July 2020).<br/><br/><strong>Eastern Pacific Ocean<br/></strong>The IATTC has adopted a harvest control rule for tropical tunas. Current conservation measures for Bigeye Tuna include a 72-day closure for large purse seine vessels (&gt;182 mt capacity), a time area closure west of the Galápagos Islands, and limits on the number of active FADs a vessel can monitor (Collette and Graves 2019).&#160;<br/><br/><strong>Western and Central Pacific Ocean</strong><br/> Based on the 2017 stock assessment, fishing mortality on juvenile bigeye tuna in the tropical region is particularly high. The management advice is therefore that WCPFC14 could continue to consider measures to reduce fishing mortality from fisheries that take juveniles in order to increase bigeye fishery yields and reduce any further impacts on the spawning potential for this stock in the region. It is also recommended as a precautionary approach that the fishing mortality on the Bigeye Tuna stock not be increased from the current level to maintain current or increased spawning biomass until an appropriate target reference point has been agreed upon by the Commission (WCPFC 2019). Existing measures include a three-month closure on FAD fishing in tropical waters, limits on the total number of vessel days, a FAD management plan and a prohibition on discards of tropical tunas (Collette and Graves 2019).&#160;<br/><br/><strong>Indian Ocean</strong><br/>In 2019, the stock status was deemed to not be overfished but subject to overfishing. If catches remain at current levels,&#160;there is a 58.9% and 60.8% probability that MSY reference points will be breached in 2021 and 2028 respectively. With reduced catches of at least 10% from current levels, the probability of breaching the reference levels in 2028 is likely to go down to 49.1%. Continued monitoring and improvement in data collection, reporting and analyses is needed to decrease the uncertainty in assessments (IOTC 2019a). While no specific management measures have been put into place by the IOTC for Bigeye Tuna, some exist for tropical tunas in general, including a FAD management plan and a ban on the discards of tropical tunas by purse seine vessels (Collette and Graves 2019).","",,false,false,Global

Historically, native Gulf populations of striped bass have never been abundant. &#160;Due to ecological constraints and anthropogenic alterations, the native Gulf population has recently been restricted to the southern extent of its historical range and is predicted to remain small despite large-scale stocking throughout the Gulf. &#160;The&#160;Apalachicola-Chattahoochee-Flint River System (ACF) is the only location where natural reproduction of native Gulf striped bass population has occurred since the 1970s. &#160;There are several merisitic, morphometric, and behavioral differences between Atlantic-origin and Gulf-origin populations of striped bass. &#160;Adult individuals of both populations are known to inhabit cool-water, oxygenated thermal refuges when&#160;water temperatures approach or exceed 25°C&#160;and when DO concentrations are lower than 2.5 mg/L. &#160;Due to the natural environment of the Gulf tributaries (high temperatures and low DO levels), viable habitat for growth (thermal refuges) has shown to be reduced by as much as 85% in the summer months.<br/><br/>The last commercial landings of striped bass in the Gulf of Mexico were recorded in the 1960s; commercial fisheries for striped bass no longer exist in the Gulf. &#160;However, recreational fisheries still prevail throughout the Gulf. &#160;Recreational striped bass fisheries are most popular in Florida and Alabama, but limited in Mississippi, Georgia, Louisiana, and Texas. &#160;In addition to fisheries pressure, the Gulf native striped bass population also faces several other threats. &#160;Existing ecological restraints of the area in addition to anthropogenic factors like segmentation, dredging, agricultural and urban chemical runoff exposure, and dam construction blocks access to spawning grounds, disrupts spawning migrations, and limits access to thermal refuges. &#160;Habitat degradation caused by pesticide contamination and coastal development has also likely lead to reduced foraging success for all age-classes of striped bass, and reduced protected from predation for young fish.<br/><br/>The restoration of Gulf native striped bass population is a major focus of several state and federal agencies and organizations, including the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the Gulf States Marine Fisheries Commission,&#160;ACF Striped Bass Technical Committee, etc., all of which have collaborated through workshops to develop management plans to maintain this population throughout the Gulf. &#160;In addition to restoring and maintaining the native striped bass population in the Gulf, there are major initiatives to establish and maintain recreational striped bass fisheries and broodfish sources throughout most of the region. &#160;Most restoration plans encourage large-scale stocking of Gulf native and Atlantic-origin striped bass fry and fingerlings. &#160;However, many stocking efforts have failed or only managed to maintain current low numbers of striped bass in the Gulf (populations are not self-sustainable). &#160;Studies have shown that stocking efforts throughout the Gulf will continue to be limited if habitat restoration is not implemented in addition to large scale stocking because reproduction and recruitment of Gulf native striped bass is limited by lack of suitable habitat. &#160;The success of habitat restoration combined with stocking has yet to be determined. &#160;Management plans continue to be revised and studies continue to be conducted to determine the best way to restore the Gulf native striped bass population. &#160;There are also several harvest regulations on the size and amount of striped bass that can be caught in the Gulf of Mexico. &#160;Therefore, the Gulf native population of&#160;<em>Morone saxatilis </em>is listed as<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;","This is a marine and estuarine coastal species that moves far upstream in channels of medium to large rivers during spawning migrations. In coastal areas, it occurs typically within 6 km of shore. Adults in inshore areas occur over a wide range of substrates. The species has been widely introduced in lakes and impoundments with some populations&#160;landlocked.&#160;Ideal temperatures for&#160;<em>M. saxatilis&#160;</em>range from 18.3 to 21.1 °C. Evidence suggests a lower temperature limit of 9.0&#160;°C (Nelson <em>et al</em>. 2010).&#160;In colder months, it tends to seek the warmest water available at depths greater than 1.5 meters.<br/><br/>This species is anadromous, seasonally migratory and has been successfully introduced in many areas.&#160;It&#160;is a voracious predator that feeds primarily on fishes and invertebrates. It is normally gonochoristic, with a rare incidence of hermaphroditic individuals. Males reach maturity at about two years of age and 17 cm total length and females at four to six years and 45-55 cm. The maximum age&#160;has been estimated to about 30 years. Maximum total length is 200 cm (Page and Burr 1991); maximum published weight is 57.0 kg (Eschmeyer&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1983).&#160;<br/><br/>Striped bass use rivers, tidally influenced fresh waters, and estuaries for spawning and nursery areas. This species is a polyandrous broadcast spawner. It spawns once a year, from April to mid-June, or once temperatures warm to about 18 °C. Females are estimated to release between 500,000 and 3 million eggs during a single spawning event, but &lt; 1% of embryos survive for more than a couple of months after hatching (Diodati 2007, Sanders 2010).&#160;Juveniles&#160;occupy inshore marine waters and adults ascend rivers to spawn. Preferred spawning areas often are shallow (1-20 feet, 0.3-6.1 meters) and turbid and range from the tidal zone to a few hundred kilometers upstream (usually within 38 miles or 60 km of coast). Spawners often seek areas with strong turbulent flow and substrates of rock and/or fine gravel. Eggs are semibuoyant, drift and sink slowly; in riverine populations, current of about 30 cm/sec reportedly is required to keep eggs afloat and prevent death due to settling on bottom (though this may vary with differences in egg buoyancy in different regions). Juveniles apparently prefer clean sandy bottom but have been found over gravel, rock, and (rarely) soft mud; may or may not move to areas of higher salinity in first summer/fall (varies with locality).<br/><br/>See Hill e<em>t al</em>. (1989) and Crance (1984) for habitat suitability index model and details on various environmental requirements and tolerances (e.g., temperature, dissolved oxygen, salinity, toxicants).<br/><br/><strong>Native Gulf Population:<br/></strong>Gulf striped bass populations are most likely riverine and endemic to individual rivers due to lack of documentation of occurrence in open waters in the Gulf of Mexico, and there is very little evidence of interchange between river systems; migratory behavior appears to be reduced in Gulf native striped bass populations (Rulifson and Laney 1999). Additionally, tagging returns for stocked Gulf-strain striped bass indicate that they do not often travel outside the system in which they were released, and they they exhibit limited movement between release site and recapture locations (Frugé <em>et al</em>. 2006).<br/><br/>A comparison of Atlantic-origin versus Gulf striped bass that were co-stocked into the same habitat over a 5-year period, showed no consistent differences in relative survival or growth through age 4 (Long <em>et al.</em> 2012). Gulf-native striped bass likely have a higher thermal tolerance than Atlantic-origin striped bass, with an upper thermal maximum around 30°C&#160;(Dieterich and Fulford 2012). &#160;&#160;<br/>There are several documented meristic differences between Atlantic-origin and Gulf-origin striped bass populations. &#160;It has also been reported that Gulf native striped bass eggs are less buoyant than Atlantic striped bass eggs from the Santee-Cooper system in South Carolina, and St. Johns River in Florida. &#160;In addition, Gulf native larvae tend to be slightly larger at hatching, have earlier yolk sac absorption, and begin feeding sooner than Atlantic-origin larvae. &#160;Hollowell (1980) reported that Gulf native striped bass have darker stripes than the Atlantic population, and that interrupted stripes occur less frequently than in the Atlantic race. Gulf native striped bass <em>may</em> also exhibit faster growth rates, and earlier maturation. &#160;Spawning period for Gulf native striped bass occurs from February to May, with a peak during early April to mid-May. &#160;Crateau (not determined) found that Gulf native striped bass females produce an average of approximately 45,000 eggs/kg body weight and exhibited at least 90% ova maturation in a single spawning season (Fruge<em> et al</em>. 2006).&#160;<br/><br/>Striped bass adults are known to occupy cool, oxygenated thermal refuges in during the summer, from April through November (Long <em>et al</em>. 2012). &#160;Adults seek thermal refuge when water temperatures approach or exceed 25°C&#160;and when DO concentrations are lower than 2.5 mg/L. &#160;If these refuges are not available during the typical periods of high growth, individuals may not reach sexual maturity.&#160;Dieterich and Fulford (2012) concluded that both of their model predictions combined with limited field observations of fish movement suggest that the period of maximum growth potential for Gulf-strain striped bass is October-April, which may limit young-of-the-year survival during their first summer and may greatly reduce the period of adult growth prior to the spawning season; studies indicate that summer months are the most critical time period for the overall health and long-term survival of striped bass.<br/>Between 1993 and 2009, 94 female and 125 male striped bass broodfish from the ACF were aged. Females ranged from age 2 to 13 and males ranged from age 2 to 7 (Long<em> et al.</em> 2012).<p></p>","<strong>Gulf of Mexico</strong><br/><em><br/></em><em>Morone saxatilis&#160;</em>populations native to the Gulf of Mexico are limited due to ecological restraints, mainly high temperatures and low DO levels. &#160;These restraints are exacerbated by anthropogenic alterations to their riverine environment, including segmentation, dredging, agricultural and urban chemical runoff exposure, and dam construction which blocks access to spawning grounds, disrupts spawning migrations, and limits access to thermal refuges. The Gulf striped bass populations are also characterized by low levels of natural reproduction. Despite stocking large numbers of fish from Atlantic-origin populations, Gulf native populations are likely to remain small and may decrease due continuing fishing pressure and habitat degradation (Dieterich and Fulford 2012, Long <em>et al.</em> 2012). Habitat degradation caused by pesticide contamination and coastal development has likely lead to reduced foraging success for all age-classes of striped bass, and reduced protection from predation for young fish (Rulifson and Laney 1999,&#160;Fruge <em>et al</em>. 2006). Due to the natural environment of the Gulf tributaries (high temperatures and low DO levels), viable habitat for growth has shown to be reduced by as much as 85% in the summer months (Dieterich and Fulford 2012).<br/><br/>The&#160;Apalachicola-Chattahoochee-Flint (ACF) river system was modeled under changing climate conditions simulating future climates and future demand for water withdrawal for human consumption. Specific anticipated changes include lower minimum flows and decreased flow variability. These changes could decrease connectivity of the channel and the floodplain, decrease habitat availability, and potentially lower the ability of the river to assimilate wastewater treatment plant effluent (Gibson <em>et a</em>l. 2005).<br/><br/><strong>Introgression<br/></strong>Historically unique microsatelite alleles in the Apalachicola-Chattahoochee-Flint river system in Geogia and Florida were reduced in frequency by introgression of non-native alleles due to stocking (Wirgin <em>et al</em>. 2005). Possible results include altered genetic characteristics of the native stock which can cause a change in genetic differences among populations (Eldridge <em>et al</em>. 2009), a change in genetic composition (Susnik <em>et al</em>. 2004), and breakdown of genetic adaptations (McGinnity <em>et al</em>. 2009).<br/><strong>Global Information (previously in account)</strong>Declines in Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta (where introduced) is attributed primarily to toxic substances and to entertainment of young in water diversion structures (Hassler 1988). Habitat destruction affected populations in Hudson River, Chesapeake Bay, and Albemarle Sound, resulting in drastic declines in mid-20th century (Hill<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;1989). Excess harvest contributed the decline along the U.S. east coast in the late 1970s and early 1980s; hatchery production and restrictions on the harvest resulted in population increases in the Chesapeake Bay region by the early 1990s (Diamond 1990).","<strong>Gulf of Mexico [[<span style="""">[supplementary document: excel sheet]]]</span></strong><p>Although striped bass is an anadromous species, populations at the northern and southern extremes of the range are generally potamodromous, migrating within freshwater systems and thus being riverine or estuarine in nature. &#160;It is likely that striped bass populations within tributaries of the Gulf of Mexico were endemic to individual rivers (Barkuloo 1967, McIlwain 1980). </p>  <p>Within the Gulf, the historical range of <em>M. saxatilis</em> from the Suwannee River (Florida), westward to the rivers of the Lake Pontchartrain basin in Louisiana.

In the 1980s interest in the conservation and restoration of the native Gulf striped bass led to stocking of only putative Gulf striped bass. </p>  <p>The restoration program is supported by genetic studies which show that a high percentage of ACF fish are genetically distinct from Atlantic populations (Wirgin 1990, 1991 1993, 1997), (Wirgin and Maceda 1991). The ACF population is now considered a different “race” from those in Atlantic rivers (Frugé&#160;<em>et al.</em><span class=""apple-converted-space""><em>&#160;</em>2006), and any striped bass originating from the ACF system is considered a Gulf striped bass (Long et al. 2012). The ACF population is the only population of Gulf striped bass which supports continued natural reproduction (Wirgin<span class=""apple-converted-space"">&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2005).

It has been introduced widely in inland areas of the United States and on the Pacific coast, where it has spread north to British Columbia and south to northern Baja California.

It is marketed fresh or filleted and frozen (Heemstra 2002). Recreational landings&#160;make up about 75-80% of the coastal landings. In 2005, almost 60% of all striped bass sold in the United States were grown in aquaculture.&#160;Aquaculture for hybrid <em>M. saxatilis</em> (<em>Morone chrysops</em> x <em>Morone saxatilis</em>) began in 1986, and production peaked in the early 2000s (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 2012).&#160;<em> </em><br/><br/><strong>Gulf of Mexico</strong><br/><br/>Currently, there are no commercial striped bass fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico; the last commercial landings occurred in the 1960s. &#160;However, recreational striped bass fisheries are still popular throughout their range in the Gulf (Frugé&#160;<em>et al. </em>2006). &#160;<br/><br/>Creel census surveys were conducted in the Apalachicola-Chattahoochee-Flint River system (ACF) in Florida, Georgia, and Alabama to determine striped bass total catch, harvest effort (hours), and angler success (striped bass catch or harvest per hour). &#160;In the Upper Apalachicola River, an average of 166 striped bass anglers (ranged from 24 to 416) were interviewed between 1982 and 2009. &#160;Directed angling effort was estimated to range from 1,098 (SE = 318) to 9, 485 (SE = 2,936) hours with an average of 3,696 hours. &#160;Annual harvest estimates during early stocking years (1980 to 1992) ranged from 152 (SE = 130) to 1,505 (SE = 474). &#160;Released striped bass were not documented in the survey data prior to 1992; it was assumed that under prevailing harvest regulations, all caught fish were harvested. &#160;Surveys conducted after harvest regulations were changed (1994 to 2009) to reduce the bag implementation and minimum size, estimated that striped bass total catch ranged from 311 (SE = 156) to 1,457 (SE=346) with and average of 688 fish. &#160;Harvest estimates ranged from 134 (SE = 49) to 796 (SE = 214), and averaged 379 fish (Long <em>et al.</em> 2012).<br/><br/>Few anglers targeted or harvested striped bass in the Lower Apalachicola River/Intracoastal Waterway. &#160;Creel survey were conducted in this area during spring 1990-2004 and fall 1990-1999. &#160;The number of anglers interviewed in this area ranged from 250 to 550 and 225 to 502, respectively. &#160;Total catch estimates ranged from 2 (SE = 2) to 1,458 (SE = 990) in the spring, and 11 (SE = 12) to 1,521 (SE = 749) in the fall. &#160;In this area, striped bass were typically caught as bycatch, and most anglers reported releasing their catch because the fish were shorter than the 457-mm-TL minimum size limit. &#160;From the spring surveys, it was estimated that only 1,484 (15%) of the 9,831 striped bass total catch estimate was harvested (Long <em>et al</em>. 2012).<br/><br/>Creel surveys from the striped bass fishery in the Flint and Chattahoochee rivers were conducted from 1995 through 1998. &#160;Within the 26-week period, total number of angler trips at the Albany Dam tailrace (Flint River) ranged from 1,741 to 5,553 with an anverage of 3,855 trips. &#160;Estimated time of direct fishing effort on striped bass averaged 801 hours, and ranged from 442 to 1,056 hours. Expanded harvest estimates ranged from 15 to 37 fish, with an average of 28 fish. &#160;The total number of angler trips taken at the GALD on the Chattahoochee River averaged 6,134 trips, and ranged from 4,758 to 7,437 trips. &#160;Hours directed fishing effort ranged from 0 to 466 hours (1192 hours on average). &#160;Expanded harvest estimates for striped bass ranged from 0 to 70, and averaged 30 fish. &#160;All of these surveys were conducted during open season for the harvest of <em>Morone saxatilis</em> (1 November-31 May). &#160;Harvest regulations for striped bass in the ACF during the time of survey were 15 fish in combination, including striped bass, hybrid striped bass, and white bass, only two of which could be over 559 mm TL (Long <em>et al</em>. 2012).<br/><strong>Florida:</strong><br/>Currently, the Jim Woodruff L&amp;D tail race is the primary location for anglers targeting striped bass in Florida. &#160;This recreational fishery has been described as an ""artisanal"" fishery, and angling effort there appears to have remained near the levels (possibly above) estimated at the time restoration efforts began. &#160;From 1980 to 2003, angler effort in this tailrace ranged from 629 hours in 1981 to 9,485 hours in 1991 (Fruge <em>et al. </em>2006).<br/><strong>Alabama:&#160;</strong><strong><br/></strong>Recreational striped bass fisheries in the Tallapoosa, Coosa, Alabama, Tombigbee, and Mobile rivers were discontinued in 1962 when the population declined. &#160;However, recreational striped bass fisheries in reservoirs along the Black Warrior and Tombigbee rivers, Lewis Smith Lake, Lake Martin, Jones Bluff Lake, and some reservoirs along the Coosa River have continued their stocking efforts. &#160;Striped bass are also regularly taken from the Mobile River and bay systems, and the Perdido and Conecuh rivers (Fruge <em>et al.</em> 2006).<br/><strong>Mississippi:</strong><strong><br/></strong>Throughout Mississippi, striped bass has been mostly recorded as bycatch by anglers (not targeted). &#160;It has been indicated that a small amount of anglers target striped bass in the Pascagoula River. &#160;Several records since 1981 reported no recreational landings, however there was a peak in 1986 with 14,154 fish caught (Fruge <em>et al.</em> 2006).<br/><strong>Louisiana:</strong><strong><br/></strong>Recreational fishing for striped bass in Louisiana is very limited. &#160;Fishermen catch striped bass incidentally along the coast, and some charter boats/guides target this species at certain times of the year. &#160;There is a small recreational striped bass fishery in the Lake Pontchartrain. &#160;Reported recreational landings have been noted to fluctuate widely and are probably not accurate (Fruge <em>et al.</em> 2006).<br/><strong>Texas:</strong><strong><br/></strong>Based on recent TPWD creel data, no substantial striped bass fishery exists anywhere along the Texas coast. &#160;However, a few anglers in the Galveston and Sabine Lakes target this species. &#160; There is a directed striped bass fishery in Galveston Bay at the outfall in Trinity Bay and is popular during March (Fruge <em>et al.</em> 2006).",Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,"<strong>Gulf of Mexico</strong><br/><strong>Apalachicola-Chattahoochee-Flint River System:</strong><br/>Since the extirpation of the Gulf native&#160;population from most river drainages in the Gulf of Mexico in the mid-1960s, restoration of these populations has been a major focus of fisheries managers in the region. &#160;Atlantic-origin striped bass began to be stocked into many Gulf rivers and reservoirs throughout the 1960s, and continues to the present in some tributaries. &#160;Stocking programs for the Apalachicola-Chattahoochee-Flint River system (ACF) in Florida, Georgia, and Alabama were initiated by the Georgia Department of Natural Resources (GADNR) for Lake Seminole in 1965, and Lake Blackshear (Flint River, Georgia) in 1967. &#160;The Florida Game and Fresh Water Fish Commission (currently the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission or FFWC) began releasing fingerlings of Atlantic origin into the Apalachicola River in 1976. &#160;Approximately 1.8 million Atlantic fry (&lt;15 mm) and 125,000 fingerlings or adults (25-750 mm TL) were stocked into the ACF from 1965 to 1976. &#160;Hybrid striped bass were also introduced into ACF reservoirs during the 1970s&#160;(Long <em>et al</em>. 2012). &#160;<br/><br/>Starting in the 1980s, ACF fisheries managers began focusing on the conservation and restoration of the native striped bass population. Genetic description and cataloging was a major component of this effort. &#160;The first annual <em>Morone </em>workshop was in 1982, where biologists and fisheries managers from Florida, Georgia, Alabama, and the Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) met to discuss management of native and hybrid striped bass in the ACF. &#160;Representatives of conservation agencies in each state and the regional director of the FWS entered into a cooperative agreement of Gulf striped bass restoration for the ACF in 1987. &#160;This agreement emphasized the restoration of a self-sustaining population of Gulf striped bass to the maximum extent possible. &#160;The ACF Striped Bass Technical Committee was also formed under this agreement. &#160;Representatives from Mississippi, Louisiana, the Gulf States Marine Fisheries Commission, New York University School of Medicine, Gulf Coast Research Lab (southern Mississippi), and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers became participants of the workshop series, and as of 2011 the ACF <em>Morone </em>workshop had met for 29 consecutive years (Long<em> et al</em>. 2012).&#160;<br/><br/>The first striped bass management plan for the ACF was finalized in 1996 (revised in 2004) with a general goal of enhancing the native Gulf striped bass population within the river system. &#160;Project objectives included:<ul><li>determining hatchery production requirements and optimum stocking rates and sizes</li><li>monitoring broodfish collections and stocking success</li><li>monitoring the sport fishery</li><li>identifying, enhancing, or protecting thermal refuge habitat</li><li>establishing broodfish repositories outside of the ACF</li><li>and participating in public outreach</li></ul>The Gulf States Marine Fisheries Commission's (GSMFC) Anadromous Fish Subcommittee created the ""Striped Bass Fishery Management Plan"" for the Gulf of Mexico (this plan was revised in 2006) (Long <em>et al</em>. 2012). &#160;The goals of this comprehensive plan were to:<ul><li>establish and maintain a self-sustaining Gulf race population and fishery in the Pearl River (Louisiana and Mississippi), Pascagoula River (Mississippi), Escambia/Conecuh River (Alabama and Florida), Choctawhatchee Riverr (Alabama and Florida), and ACF river system (Alabama, Florida, and Georgia)</li><li>maintain mixed-race fisheries in the Mobile-Alabama-Tombigbee (MAT) river system</li><li>maintain a striped bass recreational fishery in the lower Mississippi River</li><li>maintain Gulf race put-and-grow fisheries in the Tangipahoa and Tchefuncte rivers (Louisiana), Perdido River (Alabama and Florida), Blackwater and Yellow rivers (Florida), and the Ochlockonee River (Florida and Georgia)</li><li>maintain striped bass put-grow-take fisheries in the Wolf, Jourdan, Biloxi, and Tchoutacabouffa river and Old Fort Bayou (Mississippi)</li></ul>Benefits from stocking large numbers of Atlantic-origin striped bass have not been consistently sustained through time and have not resulted in the ability of the population to self-sustain at a desired level that is significantly larger than previously observed from natural reproduction alone. &#160;Due to ecological restraints and anthropogenic alterations to the riverine environment, feasible opportunities for restoration of Gulf native striped bass populations are limited in a degraded habitat. &#160;In addition, stocking of large numbers of hatchery fish has not prevented the loss of the pure ""Gulf race"" striped bass population. &#160;The physical renovation of several thermal refuges in the Apalachicola and Flint rivers met the objectives (habitat restoration or enhancement) of the ACF plan. &#160;However, due to the dynamic nature of the ACF river system, these renovation efforts were small and short-lived (Long <em>et al</em>. 2012).<br/><br/>Fisheries managers from Florida and Alabama have committed to stocking only Gulf striped bass into Gulf of Mexico tributaries within their historic range. &#160;Managers in Mississippi and Louisiana have also expressed a desire to stock only Gulf striped bass, but with the realization that they cannot sacrifice their established striped bass fisheries when Gulf fingerlings are not available for stocking. &#160;Therefore, fish managers in Mississippi are developing a broodfish repository in Ross Barnett Reservoir (Long <em>et al.</em> 2012).<br/><br/><strong>Mississippi:</strong><br/>There is also a current conservation plan in Mississippi to restore naturally-reproducing, Gulf native populations in the Pearl and Pascagoula River systems through a stock enhancement program; the program began in 1967 and remains active today. &#160;However, due to the lack of studies on factors that limit growth and survival of released striped bass in Mississippi waters, seasonal habitat availability in the habitat is relatively unknown. &#160;As in the ACF, probability for population restoration is low in the coastal waters of Mississippi without improvement of the current degraded habitat (Dieterich and Fulford 2012).<br/><strong>Texas:</strong><br/>As of 2002, striped bass had been stocked into at least 68 reservoirs on 11 Texas river systems since the 1960s. &#160;This has been described as one of the largest freshwater striped bass stocking programs in the nation, despite the discontinuation of stocking in some reservoirs. &#160;Most stocking sources were from Atlantic-origin fisheries, but a small number of Gulf native striped bass have also been stocked into Texas waters. &#160;Several successful and popular fisheries have been established in stocked lakes, including Toledo Bend Reservoir (shared with Louisiana). &#160;Natural reproduction by striped bass has been documented in the Brazos River and Trinity River in Texas but these populations are not known to be self-sustaining, and recruitment of naturally spawned striped bass into the adult population has not yet been determined. &#160;Though the river-stocking program in Texas produced successful fisheries, the bay-stocking program did not. &#160;Only 64 striped bass were caught from 1983 to 2003 by fishery-independent sampling. &#160;Most striped bass catches from fisheries were a recorded as bycatch (Fruge <em>et al</em>. 2006).<br/><strong>Louisiana:</strong><br/>Stocking in Louisiana started in the 1960s when fry were introduced in Toledo Band Reservoir and D'Arbonne Reservoir, and expanded in 1972 to inlcude stocking of several coastal rivers and estuarine areas in tan attempt to establish anadromous/coastal populations. &#160; As relatively small number of Gulf native striped bass has been stocked into two lakes in recent years, but the remainder of stocking in Louisiana was sourced from the Atlantic-origin population. &#160;There was an unsuccessful effort to establish Gulf native brood stock sources in Louisiana. &#160;In the Toledo Bend Reservoir, a put-grow-and-take striped bass fishery has been established, but no significant riverine or coastal fisheries have developed in Louisiana (Fruge <em>et al</em>. 2006).<br/><strong>Alabama:</strong><br/>The ADCNR/WFF striped bass stocking program in Alabama has been very important to the success of the fisheries in many of the reservoirs and tailwater areas of the MAT. &#160;It is likely that a limited striped bass fishery developed in coastal Alabama in 1992, but the fish produced were not preferred by anglers. &#160;The coastal stocking program in Alabama's Mobile River Delta (MRD) was discontinued in 1995, and that fishery has likely declined since that time. &#160;Substantial natural reproduction and recruitment into downstream populations has been documented in the upper Coosa River, which is assumed to mostly involve Atlantic-origin striped bass. &#160;Natural striped bass spawning also occurs in lower portions of the MAT, but it has not been determined if this involves Atlantic or Gulf race fish and whether it has resulted in recruitment. &#160;Natural reproduction alone (without stocking) has not yet been assessed to determine if it can sustain populations/fisheries in the MAT. &#160;Most striped bass populations throughout the MAT are a combination of Atlantic- and Gulf-origin fish except for portions of the Black Warrior River (upstream of Warrior Dam), which may primarily be populated by Gulf native striped bass (Fruge <em>et al</em>. 2006).&#160;<br/><strong>Florida:</strong><strong><br/></strong>Striped bass stocking began in 1961 when 307-461 mm sub-adults from the Chesapeake Bay were released into Lake Talquin. &#160;In the early 1970s, striped bass were introduced into small lakes and reservoirs of the Florida Peninsula in order to control shad populations and provided a supplemental fishery. &#160;Shad populations were successfully controlled, but fishery establishment failed. &#160;<br/><br/>Striped bass in the Escambia/Conecuh system is uncertain due to lack of data. &#160;Annual stocking in the Blackwater and Yellow rivers is likely maintaining its population. &#160;The striped bass population in the Choctawhatchee River is likely being maintained at a low level by recent stocking efforts. &#160;Since 1996, only Gulf native striped bass fingerlings have been stocked into Lake Talquin in an effort to establish a Gulf native broodstock source. &#160;There is a limited striped bass population and fishery in the Ochlockonee River that is likely supported by stock enhancement. &#160;There is no data available for the striped bass population in the Suwanee River and no substantial amount of striped bass have been stocked into the system; there is doubt whether this system has ever supported a reproducing population of striped bass. &#160; &#160;<br/>The status of the striped bass population in the smaller gulf Coast rivers of Florida is unknown due to lack of data. &#160;However, it was documented that approximately 1,000 Gulf native striped bass fingerlings were stocked adjacent to the St. Mark's River (St. Mark's National Wildlife Refuge impoundments) in 1984. &#160;There are also occasional reported recreational catches from the St. Mark's River (Fruge <em>et al</em>. 2006).<br/><br/><em>Morone saxatilis</em> (Gulf native population)<em>&#160;</em>is likely to be managed by many other government agencies and programs.

Bowheads also commonly feed on mysids and gammarid amphipods, and the diet includes at least 60 species (Lowry 1993).<br/><br/>The seasonal distribution of Bowhead Whales is strongly influenced by prey availability and pack ice conditions (Moore and Reeves 1993). During the winter, they occur within areas of sea ice (Stafford <em>et al.</em> 2012) and appear to feed mainly near the bottom (Citta <em>et al.</em> 2015). During the spring, they use leads and cracks in the ice to penetrate areas that were inaccessible during the winter due to heavy ice coverage. During the summer and autumn, they concentrate in areas where zooplankton production is high or where large-scale biophysical processes create local concentrations of calanoid copepods (Finley 1990, Finley <em>et al</em>. 2000) and appear to feed mainly in mid-water and near the surface (Citta <em>et al</em>. 2015). In the Pacific Arctic, six feeding hotspots have been identified including two in the Bering Sea and one in the Chukchi Sea along the northern coast of Chukotka where there is evidence of winter feeding, and three in the Beaufort Sea where most of the feeding occurs in summer and autumn (Citta <em>et al.</em> 2015).<br/><br/>The Bowhead Whale may be the longest-living mammal, possibly capable of living for over 200 years (George <em>et al.</em> 1999, Keane <em>et al. </em>2015, Wetzel <em>et al.</em> 2017). Nearly all life history data come from the Bering – Chukchi – Beaufort Seas population. Female age at sexual maturity is estimated at 18-33 years (Rosa <em>et al.</em> 2013). Taylor <em>et al</em>. (2007) estimated the mean generation time for Bowhead Whales to be about 52 years, assuming an age at first reproduction of 20 years. Females give birth every 3-7 years (Rugh <em>et al</em>. 1992) and calves are weaned at 9-12 months of age (Koski <em>et al. </em>1993).<p></p>  <p></p>","<p>Extensive commercial hunting, beginning in the 1500s, depleted Bowhead Whales throughout their range. Commercial whaling for the species has been prohibited under international conventions since the 1930s. The limited subsistence whaling by indigenous communities  mentioned above has not impeded the recovery of the affected populations.</p><p>Accidental human-caused deaths are relatively few. During 2010-15, two dead-stranded and one live Bowhead were observed to be entangled with fishing gear but it was unclear whether the entanglement was the cause of death. Of the Bowhead Whales taken in Alaskan hunts during 1990-2012, 12% showed scars or wounds from fishing gear and 2% showed scars or wounds from ship strikes (George <em>et al.</em> 2017a).</p>  <p>There has been concern since the 1970s that disturbance from oil and gas exploration and extraction activities in the Arctic region would affect Bowhead Whales. Effects on diving behavior (Robertson <em>et al.</em> 2013) and calling rates (Blackwell <em>et al.</em> 2015) in the vicinity of seismic surveys have been observed, but to date there has been no discernible population-level impact. Examination of whales taken in subsistence hunts off Alaska since 1980 found relatively low levels of morbidity, which would be consistent with an increasing population and good individual animal health (George <em>et al</em>. 2017b).</p>  <p>During this century, a profound reduction in the extent and thickness of sea ice in the Arctic has occurred and this reduction is predicted to continue, possibly leading eventually to the complete disappearance of sea ice in summer as mean Arctic temperatures rise faster than the global average (Frey <em>et al</em>. 2015). The short-term effects of reduced ice cover on Bowhead Whales in the western Arctic appear to be positive, due to increased feeding opportunities (George <em>et al</em>. 2015, Moore 2016). However, the long-term effects are less clear. The emergence of Bowheads as a separate, ice-adapted species may have coincided with the appearance of sea ice in the late Pliocene, and Bowheads could lose out to non-ice-adapted species in the long term, but no projections of the time scale of such an eventuality are available (Harington 2008, IWC 2016).&#160; </p>  <p>There is also concern that, as the sea ice diminishes, the opening up of the Arctic to increased vessel traffic, fishing activities, and extractive industries will increase human-caused impacts on Bowhead Whales (Reeves <em>et al</em>. 2012, 2014).&#160; </p>","<em><strong>Current Population sizes</strong></em><br/>The Bering – Chukchi – Beaufort Seas subpopulation is estimated to have numbered 16,900 (15,700-18,900) in 2011 from shore/ice-based counts (Givens <em>et al.</em> 2016) or&#160;19,000 (12,400-28,500) from photo-identification capture-recapture (Givens <em>et al.</em> 2017).&#160; Numbers in the East Canada – West Greenland subpopulation are estimated at 4,000-10,500 in 2013 from aerial surveys (Doniol-Valcroze <em>et al.</em> 2015) or 4,500-11,000 in 2008-12 from genetic mark-recapture (Frasier <em>et al.</em> 2015). Given the increasing trend in the large Bering – Chukchi – Beaufort subpopulation, the total range-wide population likely exceeds 25,000 individuals. The Okhotsk Sea subpopulation is estimated to be only about 200, and the East Greenland – Svalbard – Barents Sea subpopulation probably also numbers in the hundreds (see separate listings).<strong><em><br/> <br/> <strong>Population trends<br/></strong></em></strong>The Bering – Chukchi – Beaufort Seas subpopulation has been monitored for more than 30 years and has been increasing over that period at an estimated annual rate of 3.7% (range 2.8–5.4%) in the presence of subsistence hunting (Givens <em>et al. </em>2016). The East Canada – West Greenland subpopulation has probably also been increasing. Based on aerial surveys and genetic capture-recapture, Rekdal <em>et al</em>. (2015) concluded that the number of Bowhead Whales using West Greenland waters in the winter-spring period increased from 1998 to 2006 and has levelled off since then. The Okhotsk Sea subpopulation may be declining (Cooke <em>et al</em>. 2017). No estimates of trend are available for the East Greenland – Svalbard – Barents Sea subpopulation.<strong><em><br/><br/>Pre-whaling population sizes</em></strong><em></em><br/>Commercial whaling for Bowhead Whales in the Bering Sea began in 1848 and expanded rapidly, depleting the worldwide population (Bockstoce and Burns 1993). Brandon and Wade (2006) estimated the initial abundance of the Bering – Chukchi – Beaufort subpopulation at 10–20,000. Using a different kind of population model, Witting (2013) estimated pre-whaling abundance to be 13-24,000. Therefore, the Bering – Chukchi – Beaufort subpopulation appears to have reached or exceeded estimates of its size prior to commercial whaling. All models indicate that the population reached a minimum size around 1914.<br/><br/>Basque whalers took Bowhead Whales in the northwestern Atlantic in the 16th century, but ambiguities over the species identity of whales taken in early commercial whaling have made interpretation of old catch records difficult. Genetic analysis of bones from 16<sup>th</sup> and 17<sup>th</sup> century shore stations in the Strait of Belle Isle and Gulf of St Lawrence found that, contrary to previous assumptions, almost all bones were from Bowhead Whales rather than North Atlantic Right Whales (<em>Eubalaena glacialis</em>) (Macleod <em>et al.</em> 2008). This suggests that 25-40,000 Bowhead Whales were taken in the eastern Canadian Arctic by Basque whalers during 1530-1610, followed by approximately 28,000 during the pelagic whaling phase during 1719-1915 (Ross, 1993).<br/><br/>The pre-whaling size of the East Canada – West Greenland population was thus probably at least 25,000, well above the likely current level.The pre-whaling size of the East Greenland – Svalbard – Barents Sea population has been estimated to be 33,000-65,000 using a simple population model (Allen and Keay 2006) applied to historical catch data from Dutch, German, and British sources compiled by de Jong (1983). The current population size, therefore, is a small fraction of the pre-whaling size.  The pre-whaling population size in the Okhtosk Sea has been variously estimated as between 3,000 and 20,000 depending on assumptions about past catches (Ivashchenko and Clapham 2010). The current population size is a small fraction of those estimates.",Increasing,"<p>Bowhead Whales are found only in Arctic and subarctic regions. Until recently they have spent much of their lives in and near sea ice and they migrate seasonally to avoid ice entrapment and to take advantage of food concentrations (Moore and Reeves 1993). With the reduction of sea ice cover, Bowhead Whales now occur increasingly in open water during the summer (Moore 2016).<br/> <br/> The Scientific Committee of the International Whaling Commission (IWC) has traditionally recognized five stocks named for the regions in which Bowheads occur: Bering – Chukchi – Beaufort Seas; Hudson Bay – Foxe Basin; Davis Strait – Baffin Bay; Svalbard – Barents Sea (Spitsbergen); and Okhotsk Sea (Rugh <em>et al</em>. 2003). Movements of tagged Bowheads indicating somewhat overlapping ranges, and lack of clear genetic differences, has discredited the traditional distinction between the Hudson Bay – Foxe Basin and the Davis Strait – Baffin Bay populations (Heide-Jørgensen <em>et al</em>. 2006, Postma <em>et al.</em> 2006, Alter <em>et al.</em> 2012, IWC 2012). Four main subpopulations are now recognized: Bering – Chukchi – Beaufort Seas; East Canada – West Greenland; East Greenland – Svalbard – Barents Sea; and Okhotsk Sea. The boundary between the Bering – Chukchi – Beaufort Seas and Eastern Canada – West Greenland subpopulations is liable to become more porous as sea ice cover diminishes (Heide-Jørgensen <em>et al.</em> 2012).</p>  <p>With the exception of the Okhotsk Sea, genetic divergence between Bowhead Whales in different parts of their range appears to be low, and there is some evidence of movement between the main areas of occurrence (IWC 2013). The Okhotsk Sea subpopulation appears to be genetically and geographically isolated.</p>  <p>Based on direct observations and telemetry, the summer range of the Bering – Chukchi – Beaufort Seas subpopulation extends from Chaunskaya Guba (Russian Federation) in the western Chukchi Sea through the Beaufort Sea and east to Amundsen Gulf (Canada) and Viscount Melville Sound (Heide-Jørgensen <em>et al.</em> 2012). Most of the whales appear to migrate into the Bering Sea in winter (IWC 2013, Quakenbush <em>et al.</em> 2012, Citta <em>et al.</em> 2015). In the 19<sup>th</sup> century, substantial catches were also taken in summer in the Bering Sea,&#160;but the climatic conditions were quite different then than at the present (IWC 2013) </p>  <p>Bowhead Whales belonging to the East Canada – West Greenland subpopulation are observed in Hudson Bay, Foxe Basin, Hudson Strait, Davis Strait, Baffin Bay, Gulf of Boothia, Prince Regent Inlet, and other waters of the Canadian Arctic Archipelago. Tracking of satellite-tagged whales has confirmed movements from Foxe Basin through Fury and Hecla Strait into the Gulf of Boothia and Prince Regent Inlet, and from Cumberland Sound into Prince Regent Inlet, Gulf of Boothia, Foxe Basin, and Hudson Strait, while animals tagged in West Greenland moved to Prince Regent Inlet and Hudson Strait (Heide-Jørgensen <em>et al</em>. 2012). The whales move out of the summering areas as ice forms in autumn to wintering areas in polynyas (Holst and Stirling 1999), unconsolidated pack ice, and open water near the ice edge off West Greenland (Reeves and Heide-Jørgensen 1996) and eastern Baffin Island. Sightings and strandings have occurred in recent years in the western North Atlantic as far south as Newfoundland (Ledwell <em>et al.</em> 2007) and the Gulf of Maine (Accardo <em>et al.</em> in press).</p>  The East Greenland – Svalbard – Barents Sea subpopulation occurs from the east coast of Greenland across the Greenland Sea, including the Northeast Water polynya off northeastern Greenland, in the Barents Sea, in the Franz Josef Land Archipelago, and in the Kara Sea at least as far as far as Severnaya Zemlya. There have also been sightings further south, exceptionally reaching Iceland and the coast of Finnmark. Vagrants have been observed as far south as the western British Isles and France (de Boer <em>et al</em>. 2017). <br/><br/>The Okhotsk Sea subpopulation occurs in the northern and western Sea of Okhotsk from Shantarskiye Zaliv east to Zaliv Shelikova, Gizhiginskaya Guba, and Penzhinskaya Guba (Moore and Reeves 1993,&#160;Shpak <em>et al</em>. 2014). There is no evidence of migration into or out of the Okhotsk Sea.","<p></p><p></p><p>Limited subsistence whaling on the Bering – Chukchi – Beaufort subpopulation by indigenous people of Alaska and Chukotka is permitted by the IWC on the basis of advice from its Scientific Committee (under its aboriginal subsistence whaling management procedure). Small&#160;hunts are also authorized in Canadian waters under co-management agreements between federal agencies and indigenous communities, and in West Greenland under the IWC management procedure. The reported average annual take in Alaska and Chukotka during 2006-15 was about 55 animals struck of which about 75% were successfully landed (Allison 2017, Suydam <em>et al</em>. 2017). </p>",Marine,"<p>Bowhead Whales were legally protected from commercial whaling under the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling (ICRW) since its entry into force in 1948, and by its predecessor the Convention on the Regulation of Whaling since the 1930s. All range states except Canada are parties to the ICRW. Limited aboriginal subsistence whaling of Bowhead Whales is allowed by the IWC (the regulatory body established under the ICRW) from the Bering-Chukchi-Beaufort Seas stock and off West Greenland on the basis of scientific advice (see <em>Threats</em> section). Hunting by indigenous people in Canada is co-managed by the federal government and regional bodies created under land-claim agreements. The Bowhead Whale has been included in the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species Appendix I since 1975 and it is listed on the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals Appendix I. Bowhead Whales are managed under national threatened species legislation in the U.S.A., Canada, and the Russian Federation.</p>",Nearctic|Palearctic,,false,false,Global

While declines occurred in some regions in the past due to overexploitation, it can be assumed that the population has not been reduced by more than 50% relative to three generations ago (Red List criterion A1 for Vulnerable), given that the estimated catches, including net catches, taken during 1951-2017 (three generations of 22 years) sum to less than 180,000. The models used by the International Whaling Commission (IWC) Scientific Committee to assess the populations predict that the population has been recovering in the North Atlantic and is still declining in the western North Pacific, but work is underway to compare these predictions with recent empirical data. The Common Minke Whale is listed as Least Concern.<br/></p>  <p></p>","<p>The Common Minke Whale occurs in both coastal and offshore waters and exploits a variety of prey species in different areas according to availability.<br/><br/>In the North Atlantic, studies in Icelandic shelf waters showed a decrease during in 2003-07 in Sandeels (Ammodytidae), krill (Euphausiacea) and Capelin (<em>Mallotus villotus</em>) relative to previous years, and a corresponding increase in Herring (<em>Clupea harengus</em>) and Haddock (<em>Melanogrammus aeglefinus</em>). I<span lang=""EN-GB"">n Norwegian waters in 2000-2004, krill dominated the diet near Svalbard, while Capelin dominated the diet around Bear Island and contributed considerably to the diet along the coast of northern Norway, along with Herring and Haddock. The diet in the Norwegian Sea consisted of mainly of Herring, while the diet in the North Sea was dominated by Sandeels and Mackerel (<em>Scomber scombrus</em>) (Windsland <em>et al</em>. 2007). Minke Whales caught off Newfoundland during 1966-72 contained mainly Capelin (Mitchell 1974).<br/><br/>In the offshore northwestern Pacific, the diet during 1996-2014 consisted mainly of Japanese Anchovy (<em>Engraulis japonicus</em>), Pacific Saury (<em>Cololabis saira</em>), and Walleye Pollock <em>(Gadus chalcogrammus</em>). Krill (<em>Euphausia pacifica</em>) and squid (Tamura <em>et al</em>. 2016a). In some of the Japanese coastal areas, Pacific Sandlance (<em>Ammodytes personatus</em>) is also important (Tamura <em>et al</em>. 2016b). In the Okhotsk Sea the diet was dominated by krill (Lindstrøm <em>et al</em>. 1998).<br/><br/>Feeding habits of the Dwarf Minke Whale are poorly known. The stomach contents of an individual bycaught in Brazil contained exclusively krill (<em>Euphausia similis</em>) (Secchi <em>et al.</em> 2003).<br/><br/>All Minke Whales are subject to predation by Killer Whales (<em>Orcinus orca</em>), and tend to flee at high speed to evade them (Ford <em>et al</em>. 2005). The Minke Whales' apparently dispersed distribution outside the summer feeding season may be an adaptation to Killer Whale predation pressure (Ford and Reeves 2008).<br/><br/>With the exception of the Sea of Japan – Yellow Sea – East China Sea population, conception and birth in Common Minke Whales is believed to occur in winter. Most animals occur singly, and few in groups of more than two. The reproductive cycle of the Sea of Japan – Yellow Sea – East China Sea stock (the J stock) appears to be four months out of phase with other North Pacific Minke Whales, with conceptions occurring in October-November instead of February-March for the Okhotsk Sea – West Pacific population (Omura and Sakiura 1956, Kato 1992). This is the only known case of breeding asynchrony in baleen whale populations from the same hemisphere.<br/><br/> Methods of age determination have been developed only recently for this species (Maeda <em>et al</em>. 2018) and a direct estimate of generation time is not yet available. The limited number of individual age estimates obtained to date (Maeda <em>et al</em>. 2017) is consistent with a female age at first reproduction of 8 years as estimated from inter-specific comparisons by Taylor <em>et al</em>. (2007). Hence, the Taylor <em>et al</em>. generation time estimate of 22 years is plausible. </p>","<p>Whaling on Common Minke Whales was intensive in the northeastern Atlantic especially during 1940-83, when it reduced the population by about half (IWC 2018a). Commercial catches were phased out during 1984-87, but resumed at a reduced level in Norwegian waters in 1992 and in Icelandic waters in 2002, initially under scientific permits (IWC 2018c). The IWC Scientific Committee has approved in principle catch levels for North Atlantic Minke Whales according to its Revised Management Procedure, but catch limits are set at national level using a modified version of the procedure that allows higher limits (IWC 2018a). However, the catches actually taken have on average been below the limits set.<br/><br/>“Aboriginal subsistence whaling” has continued uninterrupted in Greenlandic waters since the 1960s. The IWC Scientific Committee regularly reviews the situation and has advised that the currently allowed levels of take of Common Minke Whales will not harm the population (IWC 2018c).<br/><br/>Catches by whaling vessels in the North Pacific peaked in the mid-1970s when the annual catch exceeded 1,500, and were phased out over 1983-87 with the coming into effect of the International Convention for Regulation of Whaling's moratorium on commercial whaling, but resumed in 1994 under a scientific permit issued by the Government of Japan. Since 2014, active whaling on Common Minke Whales has been limited to coastal operations off the Pacific coast of Japan (IWC 2018b). Net catches, including incidental catches in fisheries, do not count as “whaling” and are not regulated by the IWC, but are taken into account in the IWC Scientific Committee's assessments of population status and sustainable take levels. Net catches increased during the 1980s and have continued off Japan and Korea, and possibly also off China. The IWC Scientific Committee has expressed concern over the sustainability of takes from the autumn-breeding Sea of Japan–Yellow Sea–East China Sea population (IWC 2009), and most of its population projections predict a continuing decline of this population (IWC 2014). However, the Committee in 2017 recommended that the projection model be revised to ensure consistency with available information on recent trends in abundance (IWC 2018c).<br/><br/>Outside of the western North Pacific region, reported entanglements of Minke Whales in fishing gear are few in relation to the apparent overall abundance of the species (e.g., 6.5/year on the eastern U.S. seaboard, Hayes <em>et al</em>. 2017). Reports of ship strikes on this species are also few (e.g., 1.6/year on the eastern U.S. seaboard, Hayes <em>et al</em>. 2017). Although most ship strikes probably go undetected or unreported, the data suggest that this species may be less vulnerable to shipping than are the larger whale species.</p>","<p><strong><em>North Atlantic</em><em> </em><br/></strong>The IWC traditionally recognizes four stocks of Minke Whales in the North Atlantic: Northeast Atlantic, Central North Atlantic, West Greenland, and Canadian East Coast (which includes the U.S. east coast) but the evidence for these is equivocal. Recent genetic analyses suggest that there may be just two main breeding populations, whose winter distributions are unknown and which mix on the summer feeding grounds (Anderwald <em>et al</em>. 2011).<br/><br/>The latest review of abundance, catches, and population structure was completed by the IWC Scientific Committee in 2017 (IWC 2018a). The Committee’s review resulted in stock structure hypotheses involving 1, 2, or 3 breeding stocks being considered equally plausible.<br/><br/>Population estimates for this species by area have been variable over time (IWC 2017), probably mainly due to changes in distribution, but possibly also affected by methodological issues. The most recent estimates from surveys conducted during 2007-2015 in the main summer range are: <br/></p><ul><li>US waters (Virginia to lower Bay of Fundy): 2,591 (coefficient of variation (CV) 0.81) in 2011 (Palka 2012); <br/></li><li>Canadian Atlantic waters and Gulf of St Lawrence: 20,741 (CV 0.30) in 2007 (Lawson and Gosselin, 2011); <br/></li><li>West Greenland: 5,095 (CV 0.46), East Greenland: 2,762 (CV 0.47) (Hansen <em>et al</em>. 2018); <br/></li><li>central North Atlantic pelagic: 6,306 (CV 0.35), Iceland coastal: 12,710 (CV 0.53) in 2015 (IWC 2018a); <br/></li><li>Jan Mayen: 10,991 (CV 0.36) in 2010; <br/></li><li>West Svalbard: 5,009 (CV 0.29) in 2008; <br/></li><li>East Svalbard: 22,281 (CV 0.18) in 2008; <br/></li><li>Barents Sea: 34,125 (CV 0.34) in 2013; <br/></li><li>Norwegian Sea and Faeroes: 21,218 (CV 0.32) in 2011; <br/></li><li>British Isles and North Sea: 12,808 (CV 0.35) in 2016 (excluding most of Irish waters) (Hammond <em>et al</em>. 2017).</li></ul>These total about 156,000 with a nominal CV of 0.12.<br/><br/>Pre-modern catches of&#160;Minke Whales in the North Atlantic are known to have occurred but were probably small (Holt 1988). Recorded catches from modern whaling begin around 1930 and total just under 150,000 whales (Allison 2017). The most intense whaling on this species took place&#160;in the northeast Atlantic during 1941-83, when over 100,000 whales were taken. Simulations of the population indicate that it was reduced by about half during this period (IWC 2018a). The decline in the population was noticed at the time from the decline in catches per whaling vessel per day (IWC 1984). Commercial catches were phased out during 1984-87, but were resumed in 1993 at a reduced level and continue to this day. Catches by indigenous hunters continue in West Greenland waters, and in small numbers off East Greenland. The average annual catch of Minke Whales in the North Atlantic during 2013-17 was about 800, taken mainly in Norwegian waters (IWC 2018b). The population is predicted to have partially recovered from the past period of high catches (IWC 2018a) but abundance estimates have been too variable to corroborate this.<em><br/><br/><strong>Western North Pacific</strong></em><strong><em></em><br/></strong>The IWC recognizes three management areas in the North Pacific: Sea of Japan – Yellow Sea – East China Sea; Okhotsk Sea – West Pacific (west of 180°); and “Remainder” (east of 180°). However recent work has focused on delineating the range of the ‘J stock', which is now known to include the near-shore waters of the Pacific coast of Japan, mainly within 20 km of shore, where animals from this stock are partially sympatric with other Minke Whales, and are subject to direct and incidental takes (see Geographic Range).<br/><br/>The latest review of abundance, catches, and population structure of Minke Whales in the western North Pacific was completed by the IWC Scientific Committee in 2013 and resulted in a number of alternative hypotheses for the population structure in this region being treated as plausible, without consensus on all of them (IWC 2014). The most recent abundance estimates accepted by the IWC Scientific Committee for the western North Pacific (west of 170°E) derive from data collected during 2005-12 and total 27,000 animals (CV 0.16), of which about 60% were in the Okhotsk Sea (Allison <em>et al</em>. 2014).<br/><br/>Minke Whales have been caught in nets on the Japanese coast at least since the 17th century (Kasuya 2009), and net catches have continued in modern times alongside direct hunting (Kim 1999, Toboyama <em>et al</em>. 1992). Estimated catches in the western North Pacific since 1946 total about 60,000 Minke Whales, of which 38,000 were taken by whaling operations and 22,000 in nets (Allison 2014, IWC 2018b). These were taken primarily off Japan and Korea, plus a limited number of catches off China and some offshore catches. Catches in recent years have declined to about 250 per year, taken mainly in nets (Japan 2014-17, Korea 2013-17). The Korean fisheries catching Minke Whales are described by Song <em>et al</em>. (2010); most of the catches were in set nets, gill nets or pots. The IWC Scientific Committee has in the past expressed concern about incomplete reporting of net catches, especially as genetic capture-recapture analyses of meat market products suggested that more individuals were entering the markets than were reported caught (Baker <em>et al</em>. 2007, IWC 2009), but has since agreed on revised estimates of the net catch (Allison 2014).<br/><br/>Most of the net catch has been from J stock, given that genetic sampling of markets has shown that nearly all the products sold in Korea and nearly half the products sold from Japan have been from that stock (Lukoschek <em>et al</em>. 2009). The IWC Scientific Committee has in the past expressed particular concern on the effects of catches on the J stock, which had already been depleted by past catches (IWC 2009). The latest assessment by the Committee predicts continuing decline in the J stock (and in the Yellow Sea stock, if it is separate from the J stock) under most of the scenarios examined (IWC 2014). However, the trend has not been corroborated by other evidence, and the Scientific Committee has called for the assessments to be updated to take account of auxiliary information (IWC 2018c).<em><br/><br/><strong>Eastern North Pacific</strong></em><strong> (east of 180°E)</strong><br/>Minke Whale densities in the eastern North Pacific are generally lower than in the western region: for example, 636 (CV 0.72) for the U.S. west coast during 2008-14 (Barlow 2016), 522 (CV 0.30) for the waters of British Columbia during 2004-08 (Best <em>et al</em>. 2015), 2,020 (CV 0.73) for the eastern Bering Sea shelf (Friday <em>et al</em>. 2013), and 1,232 (CV 0.34) for coastal waters of the northern Gulf of Alaska and the eastern and central Aleutian Islands (Zerbini <em>et al.</em> 2006). Only 12 Minke Whales were seen in the international POWER surveys of the North Pacific and Gulf of Alaska north of 40°N east of 170°E during 2010-12, and none were seen south of 40°N during 2013-16 (IWC 2018d). <a style=""mso-comment-reference:GD_1;mso-comment-date: 20180319T1738"">However, because Minke Whales were not a target species and surveys continued in sea states considerably above those suitable for observing this species, no abundance estimate has been calculated (IWC 2016).</a><em><br/><br/><strong>Southern Hemisphere</strong></em><br/>It is not possible at this time to estimate the abundance of <em>B. acutorostrata</em> in the Southern Hemisphere, because most of the available quantitative sighting data do not distinguish it from the more numerous <em>B. bonaerensis</em> with which it is partially sympatric. <em>B. acutorostrata</em> has not been subject to significant exploitation in the Southern Hemisphere. Of more than 1,700 Minke Whales taken by Antarctic pelagic whaling from the 1987/88 to the 1992/93 season (when the two species have been reliably distinguished), only 16 were Dwarf Minke Whales (Nishiwaki <em>et al</em>. 2005). One was taken at 65°S and the remainder between 55° and 62°S, 55°S being the northern limit of whaling operations. Surveys of the Antarctic Peninsula in summer during 1994-2008 found only 11 Dwarf Minke Whales versus 519 Antarctic Minke Whales (Acevedo <em>et al</em>. 2011). In the IDCR/SOWER series of international cetacean surveys south of 60°S, only 0.2% of Minke Whale sightings were <em>B. acutorostrata</em> (Branch and Butterworth 2001).",Unknown,"<p>The Common Minke Whale is a cosmopolitan species found in all oceans and in nearly all latitudes, from nearly 70°S to 80°N. It occurs in the North Atlantic, the North Pacific, throughout the Southern Hemisphere and possibly also in the northern Indian Ocean. At least parts of the populations migrate to lower latitudes in winter, but there are no known areas of regular winter aggregation, except at the northern Great Barrier Reef, Australia, where Dwarf Minke Whales congregate in winter (Arnold 1997) and support a local swim-with tourism industry (Curnock <em>et al</em>. 2013). It is likely that the winter distribution of most Common Minke Whales is highly dispersed. The species can be hard to spot at sea except in fairly calm conditions but it is possible to detect its presence acoustically thanks to the confirmed identification of certain underwater sounds made by this species (Martin <em>et al</em>. 2013).<br/><br/><strong><em>North Atlantic (B. a. acutorostrata)</em><br/></strong>In summer, Minke Whales are common throughout the northern North Atlantic as far north as Baffin Bay, Greenland Sea, Svalbard (Norway), Franz Josef Land, and Novaya Zemlya, and as far south as 40°N on the U.S. east coast (Hayes <em>et al</em>. 2017), and as far south as the western English Channel and the central North Sea in Europe (Hammond <em>et al</em>. 2017). In the mid-Atlantic, summer concentrations of Minke Whales occur to at least as far south as 50°N (Sigurjónsson <em>et al</em>. 1991). It is possible that at least a part of the Minke Whale population over-winters in the summer range, but there has been little observation effort in winter to confirm this.<br/><br/>Minke Whales also occur south of the above described range in the southeastern North Atlantic, but with no obvious seasonality and not commonly seen, with the exception of the Canary Islands where they occur year-round (Van Waerebeek <em>et al</em>. 1999). There have been occasional sightings and strandings off Spain and Portugal, Western Sahara, Mauritania, Senegal, and the Cape Verde Islands (Aguilar <em>et al</em>. 1983, Van Waerebeek <em>et al</em>. 1999, Hazevoet <em>et al</em>. 2010, Hammond <em>et al</em>. 2017). Minke Whales occur regularly in the Azores, apperently year-round but in low numbers (Visser <em>et al</em>. 2011, Silva <em>et al</em>. 2014) and are occasionally seen off Maderia (Freitas <em>et al</em>. 2012). The Minke Whale is considered a “visitor species” in the Mediterranean (average &lt;1 record per year) with one vagrant recorded in the Black Sea (Reeves and Notabartolo di Sciara 2006).<br/> <br/> There are few winter sightings, but a summary by Mitchell (1991) indicates that Minke Whales do occur in winter near Bermuda, the Bahamas and the Antilles, and along the U.S. coast south of 40°N. A Norwegian winter expedition sent to the tropical Atlantic in 1989/90 to “find the breeding grounds of the Minke Whale” encountered just two at 20°N and 10°N off West Africa in December (Folklow and Blix 1991). Ten strandings have been recorded in the Gulf of Mexico (Jefferson and Schiro 1997) but very few live sightings. Minke Whales were detected off Puerto Rico in an acoustic survey in 1994 (Mellinger <em>et al</em>. 2000). A whale was satellite-tagged off western Iceland in August 2004 and tracked past the Azores to about 25°N by December before contact was lost (Víkingsson and Jørgensen 2015).<br/><br/>Acoustic monitoring from sites spaced along the mid-Atlantic ridge and the U.S. eastern seaboard, and in the eastern Caribbean showed the presence of Minke Whales in winter (November to March) at sites south of about 35°N, and only in other seasons at sites further north; these data suggest seasonal migration, but with different corridors for the spring and autumn migrations (Risch <em>et al</em>. 2014).<br/><br/><strong><em>North Pacific (B. a. scammoni)</em></strong><br/>Minke Whales occur in summer all across the North Pacific north of about 30°N in summer, with a tendency for the distribution to shift northward in mid-summer. They are particularly abundant in the Okhotsk Sea in August (Miyashita <em>et al</em>. 1996a), and also occur in the Bering Sea, around the Aleutian Islands and in the Gulf of Alaska (Moore <em>et al</em>. 2002, Zerbini <em>et al</em>. 2006) and the Chukchi Sea (Ivashin and Votrogov 1981).<br/><br/>In the western North Pacific, there are at least two distinct subpopulations, and possibly more. The so-called “J stock” is an autumn-breeding population that occurs in the Yellow Sea, East China Sea, Sea of Japan, and along the Pacific coast of Japan within 20nm of the coast, with some penetration into the Okhotsk Sea. The ""O stock,"" which like most baleen whales breeds in winter, occurs in summer in the northwestern Pacific, including off the northeastern coasts of Japan and in the Okhotsk Sea (Omura and Sakiura 1956, Kato 1992, Kanda <em>et al</em>. 2009). Minke Whales in the Yellow Sea may be distinct from the remainder of J stock (Wade <em>et al</em>. 2010, IWC 2014).<br/> <br/> The winter distribution in the western North Pacific is poorly known. Japanese expeditions to look for wintering grounds in the southwestern North Pacific during 1993-95 failed to locate any Minke Whales (Miyashita <em>et al</em>. 1996b). The timing of the arrival of Minke Whales in Korean and western Japanese waters is suggestive of migration from the south in spring and return in autumn (Ohsumi 1983). Minke Whales were detected acoustically at low densities around the Mariana Islands in winter and spring 2007 (Norris <em>et al</em>. 2017).<br/><br/>In the eastern North Pacific, there appears to be a year-round subpopulation off California and Baja California and in the Gulf of California, and Minke Whales occur in summer off Oregon, Washington, and British Columbia (Carretta <em>et al</em>. 2017). Minke Whales have for many years been detected both acoustically and visually around the Hawaiian Islands in winter but not in substantial numbers (Carretta <em>et al</em>. 2017). The wintering area in the eastern North Pacific (U.S. mainland to Hawaii) has been identified acoustically to be primarily between 15° and 35° N latitude, with a boundary at around 135°W between two populations with acoustically distinct signatures (Rankin and Barlow 2005).<br/><br/><strong><em>Northern Indian Ocean</em><br/></strong>There have been very few records of Minke Whales in the northern Indian Ocean and none of them have been confirmed (Brownell<em> et al</em>, 2017). Deriyanagala (1963) described a new subspecies of Minke Whale, <em>B. acutorostrata thalmaha, </em>from strandings in Sri Lanka but subsequent examination of&#160; the type specimen indicated that it was probably from a Bryde's whale, <em>B. edeni </em>(Brownell <em>et al</em>. 2017).<br/><br/><strong><em>Southern Hemisphere (Dwarf Minke Whales)</em></strong><br/>Much of the data on the occurrence of Minke Whales in the Southern Hemisphere is ambiguous with respect to identification as <em>B. acutorostrata</em> or <em>B. bonaerensis</em>, because the two species are partially sympatric. Japanese scouting vessel data indicated high abundance of Minke Whales in November between 10°-30°S in the central South Pacific and in much of the eastern and southern Indian Ocean to 50°S (Miyashita <em>et al</em>. 1996a), but the species identity is unclear. The limited information available from surveys in low and middle latitudes from the 1987/88 season onwards, when the two species were reliably distinguished, indicates that most of the Minke Whales were <em>B. bonaerensis</em> (Nishiwaki <em>et al</em>. 1991), probably on route to the Antarctic from (as yet unknown) low-latitude breeding grounds, but that <em>B. acutorostrata</em> is also present in these latitudes.<br/><br/>Dwarf Minke Whales (<em>B. acutorostrata</em>) also occur at higher latitudes in the Southern Hemisphere but are much less common than <em>B. bonaerensis</em>. A winter survey in the Bellinghausen Sea in August 1993 found two Dwarf Minke Whales, including one at 69°25’S which is the southernmost record for this species (Acevedo <em>et al</em>. 2011). </p>  <p>In coastal waters, Dwarf Minke Whales have been recorded off most of the South Atlantic coast of South America (Zerbini <em>et al</em>. 1996, Secchi <em>et al</em>. 2003), in the Beagle Channel (Chile/Argentina) (Acevedo <em>et al</em>. 2006), and off South Africa (Best 1985), Australia (Arnold <em>et al</em>. 1987, Arnold 1997), New Zealand (Dawson and Slooten 1990), and New Caledonia (Garrigue and Greaves 2001). The most northerly confirmed Southern Hemisphere record is from 2°S, off the northern coast of Brazil (Magalhães <em>et al</em>. 2007). Three Dwarf Minke Whales were caught in whaling operations off Costinha, Brazil in 1980 along with 900 Antarctic Minke Whales (da Rocha and Braga 1982).</p>","<p></p><p>  </p><p>Common Minke Whales were heavily hunted in the past, and hunting at a reduced level is ongoing in parts of the North Atlantic and North Pacific. The latest available Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) trade reports show 199 tonnes of Minke Whale products exported from Norway to Japan in 2016, and 110 tonnes exported from Iceland to Japan in 2013 (CITES 2017). There have been no reported directed takes on the high seas since 2014.</p>  <p></p>",Marine,"<p></p><p>  </p><p>Catch limits for all commercial whaling of Common Minke Whales have been set at zero by the IWC since 1986. This moratorium applies to all states that are members of the IWC, except those that hold objections or reservations (Iceland, Norway, and the Russian Federation). The moratorium does not cover net catches (which occur mainly in Japan and Korea), catches taken under Special Permits for scientific research (which, for this species, have since 2014 only been issued for takes off the Pacific coast of Japan), or catches for “aboriginal subsistence whaling” under IWC management (which, for this species, is currently practiced regularly only off Greenland). <em>Balaenoptera acutorostrata</em> is included in Appendix I of CITES, with the exception of the West Greenland population which is included in Appendix II. The Appendix I listing implies prohibition of commercial international trade in products, but such prohibition does not apply to Iceland, Norway, or Japan, who hold reservations on the species (see Use and Trade).

IUCN Guidelines note that species should not be classified as Data Deficient for reasons of taxonomic uncertainty alone. Therefore, the Bryde’s Whale is assessed here as one species, with most individuals belonging to the larger pelagic subspecies <em>B. e. brydei</em>. The large-type Bryde’s Whale <em>B. e. brydei</em> has been reduced by whaling, but not to the extent that would result in an IUCN Red List threatened category within its worldwide range. The taxon is therefore listed as Least Concern. There are several subpopulations or subspecies that should be assessed separately and may warrant threatened categories. One of these, the Gulf of Mexico Whale, has been listed as Critically Endangered on the Red List (Corkeron <em>et al</em>. 2017).","<span class=""datalabel1"">The ecology of Bryde’s Whales differs among populations and it is hard to make generalizations. The resident South African small inshore form showed no marked seasonality in reproduction and fed mainly on Anchovy, Pilchard, and Jack Mackerel, while the offshore (ordinary) form bred primarily in autumn and fed primarily on euphausiids and myctophids (Best 1977). Kawamura (1977) found that Bryde’s Whales from the South Pacific and Indian Oceans fed solely on euphausiids, but Ohsumi (1977) and Watanabe <em>et al.</em><span class=""datalabel1""> (2013) found that in the northwesterm Pacific they consumed Anchovy in addition to euphausiids.

Pelagic whaling resumed in the western North Pacific in 2000 under special permits and continued until 2016 but catches were limited to 50 per year (25 per year from 2014) (Allison 2017). Like most cetaceans, Bryde’s Whales are occasionally by-caught in fishing gear. Records of vessel strikes are generally rare. However, bycatch and vessel strikes are poorly reported throughout much of the range of these whales. Vessel strikes were frequently reported in the Hauraki Gulf region <span class=""datalabel1"">(0.9 whales/year) during 1994-2014 <span class=""datalabel1"">and were of concern for this small local subpopulation (Constantine <em>et al</em>. 2015<span class=""datalabel1"">).

Bryde’s Whales were also caught from whaling stations in Taiwan during 1976-80, from the Ogasawara (Bonin) Islands (Japan) during 1946-52 and 1981-87, and by a pelagic factory catcher based in the Philippines that operated during 1983-1985 (Perrin 2006, IWC 2008).

Bryde’s Whales have been distinguished from Sei Whales in Japanese national catch statistics from 1962, and in whaling company records from 1955, but in sighting records only from 1972 (Ohsumi 1977). An additional problem has been inaccurate catch records: for example, Kondo and Kasuya (2002) reported that catches of Bryde’s Whales by Japanese operations around the Ogasawara Islands during 1981-87 were falsely reported as totalling 2,659, in order to keep within catch limits, but that the true total was 4,162. In some cases, the pre-1972 species breakdown of “Sei” Whale catches can be determined from original records, or estimated, based on current knowledge of the geographical and seasonal occurrence of Sei and Bryde’s Whales, or from the compositions of later catches in the same area and season. The IWC Scientific Committee determined “low”, “best”, and “high” estimates of 20th century Bryde’s Whale catches in the North Pacific, totaling about 13,000, 17,000, and 27,000 respectively (IWC 2008), but the latest best estimate of the Bryde’s Whale catches in the North Pacific is about 20,000 (Allison 2017).</p>  <p>Bryde’s Whales were distinguished from Sei Whales in Peruvian catch statistics from 1973, and 3,589 are recorded as having been caught during 1973-83 (Allison 2017). Of the 2,639 “Sei” Whales reported caught during 1967-72, the majority were probably Bryde’s Whales, judging from the catch composition in 1973-77. </p>  <p>The current abundance estimate for the western and central North Pacific (west of 165°W) accepted by the IWC Scientific Committee is 26,300 (coefficient of variation (CV) = 18.5%) based on surveys conducted in summer during 1988-2016 (Hakamada <em>et al</em>. 2017, IWC 2018). </p>  <p>The most recent accepted abundance estimate for the East China Sea stock is 137 (IWC 1996). It was subject to whaling in southwestern Japan until the early 1970s, and may have been depleted (Omura 1977). Using photo-identification, Pheothep <em>et al</em>. (2015) estimated a population of 63±8 Bryde's Whales in the upper Gulf of Thailand. No other population estimates are available for southeast Asian waters.</p>  <p>Wade and Gerrodette (1993) estimated 13,000 (CV = 20%) Bryde’s Whales for the eastern tropical Pacific (in an irregularly-shaped area of 19 million km² between about 15°S and 25°N and extending westward towards Hawaii) from data collected during 1986-90. </p>  <p>An IWC/International Decade of Cetacean Research —later Southern Ocean Whale and Ecosystem Research — survey of the eastern equatorial Pacific (10°S-10°N, 80°-110°W) in December 1982 yielded an estimate of 17,000 (CV = 32%) Bryde’s Whales (IWC 1984), but the estimate should be recalculated using current methods. More recent surveys (2000-17) have been confined to certain coastal regions of Panama, Peru, Ecuador, and the Galápagos: 102 individuals were sighted including 4 resightings across years (Castro <em>et al</em>. 2017).<br/> <br/> The number of Bryde's Whales in the Gulf of California has been estimated at 235 (range 173-327) (IWC 1996); these whales may belong to a wider eastern tropical Pacific population. </p>  <p><em>Southern Hemisphere</em><em><br/> </em>The Southern Hemisphere stocks of Bryde’s Whales have not been re-assessed since 1980, but the abundance estimates accepted at the time were: southern Indian Ocean − 13,854; western South Pacific − 16,585; and eastern South Pacific – 13,194 (IWC 1981). These estimates were not based on what are currently accepted methods of survey design and analysis. Based on a majority recommendation of the Scientific Committee, the IWC subsequently reset the classification of these stocks to “zero catch limit pending a satisfactory estimate of stock size” (IWC 1983).<br/> <br/> The South African inshore stock was estimated at 582 (±184) in 1983 (Best <em>et al</em>. 1984). Over 2,000 Bryde’s Whales are recorded as caught by modern whaling during 1911-67 in Cape Province, South Africa, including 1,300 during 1947-67 (Allison 2017). The relative proportions of the inshore and offshore forms in the catch are uncertain, because the two main South African land stations (Durban and Donkergat) were situated at the periphery of the ranges of the inshore and offshore populations (Best 2007).</p>  <p>No population estimates are available for the remainder of the South Atlantic. Of 2,536 “Sei” Whales taken by the pirate whaling ship <em>Sierra </em>in the South Atlantic during 1969-76, the majority are believed to have been Bryde’s Whales (IWC 1980). In addition, the majority or all of the 641 “Sei” Whale taken off Cape Lopez, Gabon during the 1950s are believed to have been Bryde’s Whales (Ruud 1952). Of the over 5,000 “Sei” Whales recorded as caught off Brazil during 1948-77, at least some were Bryde’s Whales: Omura (1962) and Williamson (1975) suggested that only 8% of the catches were Bryde’s Whales but most subsequent sightings and strandings of Sei/Bryde’s Whales in Brazilian waters have turned out to be Bryde’s Whales (Zerbini <em>et al</em>. 1997). </p>  <p>In the western South Pacific, the number of Bryde’s Whales in the Hauraki Gulf was estimated to be 100-183 using photo-identification (Tezanos-Pinto <em>et al</em>. 2017).</p></span><span class=""datalabel1""><span class=""datalabel1""><em>Northern Indian Ocean<br/></em>Bryde’s Whales are distributed throughout the northern Indian Ocean (Arabian Sea and Bay of Bengal) but no population estimates exist for either region.

At least one form also occurs in the Red Sea. Migration to tropical waters in winter is documented for the southeastern Atlantic subpopulation (Best 2001) and for the northwestern Pacific subpopulation (Kanda <em>et al</em>. 2007). The migration patterns of other populations are poorly known. Their occurrence in the North Pacific is generally confined to waters warmer than 20°C (Omura 1959, Sasaki <em>et al</em>. 2013), but they are also found in colder waters off the west coast of southern Africa and northward to at least 3°N (off Cameroon) in the Benguela Current (Best 2001). <br/> &#160;<br/> <em>Pacific Ocean</em></p>  <p>Bryde’s Whales occur across the western and central North Pacific, mainly north of 20°N in summer and south of 20°N in winter. In the eastern North Pacific, they are rarely found as far north as southern California (U.S.A.), but they occur throughout the eastern tropical Pacific from the Gulf of California, Mexico southward to Peru (Wade and Gerrodette 1993). Phylogenetic analyses of available samples revealed that these whales were nominally <em>B. brydei</em>, of the type currently referred to as <em>B. e. brydei</em> (Kanda <em>et al</em>. 2007). They also occur throughout the rest of the tropical Pacific, and across the South Pacific southward to about 35°S, but with shifts in distributions between seasons (Miyashita <em>et al.</em> 1996). They occur off the coasts of Peru and Ecuador, including the Galápagos Islands, perhaps throughout the year (Castro <em>et al</em>. 2017), and off Chile in an upwelling area between 35° and 37°S (Gallardo <em>et al.</em> 1983). All of a small number of genetic samples of Bryde’s Whales from Chile were assigned to <em>B. e. brydei</em>, and genetic samples of whales from Peru were also assigned to <em>B. e. brydei</em> (Pastene <em>et al</em>. 2015).</p>  <p>In the southwestern Pacific, their distribution extends as far south as the North Island of New Zealand, where they occur year-round in the Hauraki Gulf (Baker and Madon 2007), and these whales have been genetically identified as <em>B. e. brydei</em> (Wiseman 2008). Bryde’s Whales taken under special permits by Japan in the western South Pacific north of New Zealand were also assigned phylogenetically to <em>B. e. brydei</em> (Kanda <em>et al</em>. 2007), as was a specimen taken to the north near the Kermadec Islands (Omura <em>et al</em>. 1981<em>, </em>Wada <em>et al</em>. 2003).</p>  <p>Bryde’s Whales, some of which appear to be resident, are found in the Gulf of California (Sea of Cortez) (Urbán and Flores 1996): these have been assigned phylogenetically to <em>B</em>. e. <em>brydei</em> (Viloria <em>et al.</em> 2012).</p>  <p>Phylogenetic analyses revealed that the small “Bryde’s Whales” taken in the Philippines artisanal whale hunt (Perrin <em>et al</em>. 1996) included both <em>B. e. edeni</em> and <em>B. omurai </em>(Sasaki <em>et al</em>. 2006, LeDuc and Dizon 2002).</p>  <p>Bryde’s Whales that occur off southern and southwestern Japan are now considered to belong to an East China Sea population, having earlier been thought to be a local resident population (Yoshida and Kato 1999).

A stranding from Hong Kong in 1994 (LeDuc and Dizon 2002) and a rescued river-trapped individual in eastern Australia (Priddel and Wheeler 1998) have also been found to be closely related phylogenetically to the <em>B. edeni</em> clade represented by the Junge (1950) specimen from near Singapore and the southwestern Japan whales noted above (Sasaki <em>et al. </em>2006).</p>  <p><em>Indian Ocean</em></p>  <p>Bryde’s Whales occur throughout the Indian Ocean north of about 35°S. Those in the southern Indian Ocean appear to be large-type animals (Ohsumi 1980), as are the Bryde’s Whales found around the Maldives (Anderson 2005) and those of the northwestern Indian Ocean that were taken illegally by Soviet whaling fleets in the 1960s (Mikhalev 2000). All of these whales are assumed to be the offshore form <em>B. e. brydei, </em>and phylogenetically the whales from the southern Indian Ocean and the Maldives are in the <em>B. e. brydei </em>clade (Kershaw <em>et al.</em> 2013).</p>  <p>Kershaw <em>et al.</em> (2013) assigned Bryde’s Whales genetically sampled in coastal waters of Oman and Bangladesh to <em>B. e. edeni</em>. Whales sampled in the Maldives and whales taken offshore south of Java were assigned by Kanda <em>et al</em>. (2007) to <em>B. e. brydei</em>.</p>  <p>The <em>B. edeni </em>holotype (Anderson 1879) is from the Gulf of Martaban, Myanmar, Andaman Sea. Further specimens were found on the Bay of Bengal coast of Myanmar (Anderson 1879) and in Bangladesh (Andrews 1918). The Junge (1950) specimen, used in recent studies as the genetic representative of <em>B. e. edeni</em>, is from Sugi Island, Sumatra, Indonesia. Historical specimens held in Thailand are either <em>B. e. edeni </em>or<em> B. omurai</em> based on morphometrics (Yamada <em>et al. </em>2008). </p>  <p>The identity of a few “Bryde’s Whales” maturing at a small size (11-12 m) caught off Western Australia (Bannister 1964) is unclear.

Its main distribution is on Agulhas Bank between East London and Saldanha Bay (Best 2001). This population is closer phylogenetically to <em>B. e. brydei</em> and <em>B. borealis</em> than to <em>B. e. edeni</em> (Penry 2010). </p>  <p>Elsewhere in the Atlantic the distribution of Bryde’s Whales is not well known. They are observed regularly as far north as the Canary Islands and Madeira between June and November (Alves <em>et al.</em> 2010) and occasionally around the Azores (Steiner <em>et al</em>. 2007). One Madeira whale was identified genetically as <em>B. e. brydei</em> (Luksenburg <em>et al</em>. 2015). Bryde’s Whales are rarely found as far north as Cape Hatteras in the northwestern Atlantic (Rice 1998) and at least some of the records from the coast of the southeastern U.S.A. are a recently recognized taxon (subspecies or possibly species) that is found mainly in the Gulf of Mexico (Rosel and Wilcox 2014, Rosel <em>et al.</em> 2016). Bryde’s Whales have not been reported in the Mediterranean Sea (Reeves and Notarbartolo di Sciara 2006).</p>  <p>Bryde’s Whales occur throughout the wider Caribbean Sea (Ward <em>et al.</em> 2001). Four Bryde’s Whales stranded in Aruba, southern Caribbean, were identified phylogenetically as <em>B. e. brydei</em> (Luksenburg <em>et al</em>. 2015).</p>  <p>Bryde’s Whales occur year-round throughout coastal waters of Brazil (Zerbini <em>et al.</em> 1997) and strand regularly in southeastern Brazil (De Moura and Siciliano 2012). Samples of whales from Brazil have been assigned phylogenetically to <em>B. e. brydei</em><em></em>. However, considerable divergence was found between Bryde’s Whales from Brazil and those from Peru and Chile, which suggests that there are no direct movements of this species between the Atlantic and the Pacific (Pastene <em>et al</em>. 2015).</p></span>","<p><span class=""datalabel1"">Between 2000 and 2016, up to 50 <span class=""datalabel1"">Bryde’s Whales were taken annually under special permit by Japan in the western North Pacific, but there are currently no plans to continue this catch.

The Bryde’s Whale is included in Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species although Japan has held a reservation against this listing since 1983.

For this reason, the species is assessed under IUCN Red List criterion A1, not under A2, A3, or A4. The current global population size is uncertain due to lack of data from major parts of the range, especially from mid-latitudes in the Southern Hemisphere. Therefore, rigorous evaluation against the criteria is not possible. However, plausible projections of the global mature population size indicate that it has probably recovered to over 30% of the level of three generations ago (1940) (i.e., reduction of &lt;70% over the last three generations) but has not necessarily yet reached 50% of that level; therefore, the Red List category is changed from Endangered to Vulnerable. It is important that existing data on abundance and distribution be worked up, and that data be collected in the areas where it is currently lacking, in order to verify to what extent the predicted recovery has occurred.&#160; <span class=""MsoCommentReference""></p>","<p>The available quantitative evidence suggests that the Fin Whale is a generalist feeder, sometimes preying heavily on fish but mostly on crustaceans. In Icelandic catches, 96% contained krill only, 2.5% a mixture of krill and fish, and 1.6% fish only (Sigurjónsson and Víkingsson 1997), while only 1 of 267 Fin Whales caught in the northeast Pacific off British Columbia, Canada, contained fish (Flinn<em> et al. </em>2002), and over 99% of stomachs with food in the Antarctic contained krill (Kawamura 1994). On the other hand, Overholtz and Nicolas (1979) reported apparent feeding by Fin Whales on American Sand Lance (Sand Eel),&#160;<em>Ammodytes americanus,</em> in the northwest Atlantic, and Mitchell (1972) found that Capelin, <em>Mallotus villosus</em>, comprised 80-90% of prey in Fin Whales caught off Newfoundland. Capelin abundance is extremely variable over time, and Fin Whales may feed opportunistically on Capelin in years with high abundance.<br/><br/>The Fin Whale is the fastest of the great whales, being able to maintain speeds of over 10 ms<sup>-1</sup> or 20 kn (Bose and Lien 1989). The high speed is likely an adaptation to avoid predation by Killer Whales, <em>Orcinus orca</em>, (Ford and Reeves 2008) rather than to catch fast prey, because maximum speeds associated with lunge feeding are thought to be below 5 ms<sup>-1</sup> (Potvin <em>et al</em>. 2009). The apparent lack of winter breeding aggregations may also be an adaptation to avoid predation of calves, in the context of a flight rather than fight strategy to escape predation.&#160;</p>","<p>Prior to the advent of modern whaling in the late 19th century, Fin Whales were not subject to much human predation because they were hard to catch, but they were depleted worldwide by commercial whaling in the 20th century. Fin Whales have been protected in the Southern Hemisphere and North Pacific since 1976, and catches ceased in the North Atlantic by 1990, except for small “aboriginal subsistence” catches off Greenland. Commercial catches resumed off Iceland in 2006, but none have been taken in 2016 or 2017. A Japanese fleet resumed experimental catches of Fin Whales in the Antarctic in 2005, but this also has been discontinued. It seems unlikely that catching of Fin Whales will return to the high levels of previous years, not least due to the limited market demand for whale products.<br/> <br/> Fin Whales are one of the more commonly recorded species of large whale reported in vessel collisions (Laist <em>et al</em>. 2001, IWC 2018d). An average of 2 collisions per year between Fin Whales and vessels was recorded off the U.S. east coast during 2010-14 (Hayes <em>et al</em>. 2017). Although reported incidents have been very few relative to the abundance of the species, most collisions involving large vessels are probably not detected, and to date there has been no satisfactory quantitative assessment of the actual risk. There is concern that collisions in the Mediterranean, especially in the main summering ground of Fin Whales in the Ligurian Sea and Gulf of Lyon where there are high densities of both whales and vessels, may be frequent enough to impact the population there (Panigada <em>et al</em>. 2006).<br/><br/>Fin Whales are also subject to entanglement in commercial fishing gear. Nine cases of entanglement were recorded off the U.S. coast during 2010-14 (Hayes <em>et al.</em> 2017). Five entanglements involving Fin Whales worldwide were reported to the IWC Scientific Committee in 2017 (Hughes 2018). Although not all countries report, and some incidents will be missed by those that do, it appears likely that, globally, the threat from entanglement is low relative to the overall abundance of the species.</p>","<p><strong><em>North Atlantic<br/></em></strong>The Fin Whale was not easily catchable by early whalers due to its size and speed, but was heavily exploited from the start of mechanized whaling in 1864, particularly off Norway, Iceland, the Faeroes, and the British Isles. Whaling then spread to Spain, Greenland, and eastern Canada, and exploitation continued at a lower level until the 1980s. Fin whaling was phased out in the 1980s except for small catches off West Greenland. Catches resumed off western Iceland in 2007, but no catches have been taken there since 2015 (IWC 2018a).<br/> <br/> Catch statistics for the early years are incomplete: some are not divided into species, and a significant number of whales,&#160;perhaps 30-50%,&#160;were killed but lost due to lines breaking, etc. (Johnsen 1959, IWC 2017). The International Whaling Commission (IWC) Scientific Committee has produced “best” and “high” estimates of Fin Whale kills in the North Atlantic totalling 98,000 and 115,000 respectively (IWC 2017).<br/><br/>Over the last three decades several sets of surveys have been conducted in the North Atlantic in summer to estimates the abundance of Fin Whales and other cetacean species. The most recent abundance estimates for each area are: East Greenland coastal 6,440 (CV 0.26) in 2015 (Hansen et al. 2018); East Greenland (excl. coastal), Iceland, and Faeroes 40,788 (CV 0.17) in 2015 (NASS2015 surveys, Pike <em>et al</em>. 2016); Norway and Jan Mayen 6,409 (CV 0.18) in 1996-2001 (Øien 2009); UK waters, North and Irish Seas, French and Spanish Atlantic waters and coast of Portugal 18,142 (CV 0.35) in 2016 (SCANS III surveys, Hammond <em>et al</em>. 2017); Atlantic Canada 3,522 (CV 0.27) in 2007 (Lawson and Gosselin 2009); U.S. east coast 1,595 (CV 0.33) in 2011 (Palka 2012); West Greenland 2,215 (CV 0.41) in 2015 (Hansen et al. 2018). The available estimates total about 79,000 whales with a nominal CV of 0.13.&#160;These figures do not include the waters to the west of Ireland, where Fin Whales are fairly abundant. Data collected in Norwegian waters during 2002-17 have&#160; yet (May 2018) to be worked up.<br/><br/>Compared with previous estimates, the latest estimates show a substantial increase for the East Greenland–Iceland–Faroes area but an annual rate of increase that takes survey differences into account has not yet been calculated. The estimates for the Spain–Portugal–France–British Isles area show little change over the years from the first estimate of 17,355 (CV 0.27) obtained in 1989 (Buckland <em>et al</em>. 1992). The trends in U.S., Canadian, western Greenlandic, and Norwegian waters have yet to be determined.<br/><br/>The overall increase in North Atlantic Fin Whales may represent a continuing recovery from past whaling, but it has also been hypothesized that the recovery was already essentially complete by 2000 and that the latest increase is due to environmental changes (Víkingsson <em>et al</em>. 2015).<br/><br/><strong><em>Mediterranean</em><br/> </strong>Within the Mediterranean, the Fin Whale population was estimated in 1991 from surveys covering much of the western basin at 3,583 (CV 0.27) (Forcada <em>et al</em>. 1996). Given the relative rarity of Fin Whales in the Mediterranean outside this area, a total population of about 5,000 for the Mediterranean is plausible (Reeves and Notarbartolo di Sciara 2006). The relative abundance in the Pelagos Sanctuary in the Gulf of Lyon has been monitored since 2009 from ferries on fixed routes, but the counts are too variable to estimate a trend (Cominelli <em>et al</em>. 2016).<br/><br/>Catches of about 7,000 Fin Whales taken in and near the Straits of Gibraltar during the 1920s depleted the local abundance and may have reduced a population migrating between the Atlantic and the Mediterranean (Sanpera and Aguilar 1992).<br/><br/><strong><em>North Pacific</em><br/></strong>Some Fin Whales were likely taken by pre-modern whaling in Japan although the different species of <em>Balaenopter</em><em><em>a</em> were not always distinguished (Omura 1986). </em>A total of 76,000 Fin Whales are recorded taken by modern whaling in the North Pacific during 1910-75 (Allison 2017). The total killed is likely to be higher, because many or most of the approximately 6,500 unspecified whales taken during 1900-09 may have been Fin Whales, and in the early years of modern whaling there were likely, as in the North Atlantic, a substantial number of whales that were killed but not successfully landed. Fin Whales were legally protected from whaling by the IWC in the North Pacific from 1976, but small catches, reported at the time as Bryde’s Whales (<em>Balaenoptera edeni</em>), continued off Korea until 1981. These whales were probably from the East China Sea population.<br/><br/>North Pacific Fin Whale stocks have not been assessed in depth by the IWC Scientific Committee since 1973, when the assessment by Ohsumi and Wada (1974) was accepted. It was updated by Allen (1977). The stock in the western North Pacific was estimated to have declined from an “initial level” of 44,000 to 17,000 in 1975. The figures refer to the “exploitable” population, i.e., whales above the minimum allowed size at capture. Although these assessments were based on indices of catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) and sightings-per-unit-effort (SPUE) that did not meet modern requirements for the analysis of such data (IWC 1989), there is no doubt that the populations declined substantially.<br/><br/>There is currently no population estimate for Fin Whales in the North Pacific as a whole, but one may become available once existing data holdings are worked up. The abundance information for each area is summarized here.<br/><br/>In surveys conducted in the Okhotsk Sea in 2003, 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2015, the Fin Whale was consistently the most commonly sighted baleen whale species (Miyashita 2004, Yoshida <em>et al</em>. 2010, 2011; Minamikawa <em>et al</em>. 2012, Myasnikov <em>et al</em>. 2016) but the data have not yet been worked up to produce an abundance estimate.<br/><br/>The area of the northwestern Pacific bounded by the 170°E meridian, the coast of Japan, and the border of the Russian Exclusive Economic Zone adjacent to Kamchatka and the Kuril Islands, has been surveyed during 2002-2015 by vessels associated with the JARPN II (2<sup>nd</sup> Japanese Research Programme in the North Pacific) programme. An estimate of about 4,000 Fin Whales (CV 0.4) was derived from data collected in July-August 2008 (Hakamada and Matsuoka 2016).<br/><br/>The area between the 170°E and 135°W meridians. bounded to the north by the coast of Alaska and the Aleutian chain, was surveyed by the POWER (Pacific Ocean Whale and Environment) international cruise in July and August over the years 2010-2012 (IWC 2018c). The data have not yet been worked up to yield an abundance estimate for Fin Whales, but the counts show that Fin Whales were approximately as abundant as Sei Whales, for which an estimate of about 30,000 whales (CV 0.24) has been calculated (Hakamada <em>et al</em>. 2017).<br/><br/>It is planned to survey the Bering Sea in three parts over 2017-2019 under the POWER programme (IWC 2018c). The eastern Bering Sea was covered in 2017, and the Fin Whale was the most commonly sighted baleen whale species (<a href=""https://iwc.int/iwc-power-research-ship-returns-to-japan"">https://iwc.int/iwc-power-research-ship-returns-to-japan</a>). The eastern Bering Sea had previously been covered by U.S. fishery surveys, yielding an estimate of 1,061 (CV 0.38) Fin Whales (Friday <em>et al</em>. 2013). Zerbini <em>et al</em>. (2006) estimated the abundance of Fin Whales to be 1,652 (CV ~0.2) in the coastal waters south of the Alaska Peninsula, which is included in the area surveyed by the 2011-12 POWER. An estimate of 4.8% for the annual rate of increase over the period 1987-2003 was obtained with nominal confidence limits of 4.1%-5.4%, but subsequent recalculation of the variance from the data indicates much lower precision (95% confidence limits -1.6% to +11.1% per year) (IWC 2009). In a survey of the western Bering Sea in 2005, Fin Whales (along with Humpback Whales) were the most frequently encountered species, but no abundance estimate has been calculated (Miyashita 2006).<br/><br/>Based on surveys conducted during 2004-08, Best <em>et al</em>. (2015) estimated the abundance Fin Whales in the waters of British Columbia (Canada) to be 329 (95% confidence interval (CI) 274-395).<br/><br/>The summer abundance off the west coast of the continental U.S.A. (Washington/Oregon/California) is estimated to have been 9,029 (CV 0.12) whales in 2014, while the average rate of increase over 1991-2014 was 7.5% per year. (Nadeem <em>et al</em>. 2016). However, the variation around the trend line was greater than would be expected from sampling variance alone, suggesting that a variable proportion of the population is found in the area each year.<br/><br/>This genetically isolated Gulf of California subpopulation was estimated in 2004 from a mark-recapture analysis of photo-identification data at 613 (CI 426-970) (Díaz-Guzman 2006). There are no data on population trend for this subpopulation.<em><br/><br/><strong>Southern Hemisphere</strong></em><strong><br/></strong>Along with other baleen whales, the IWC has traditionally managed Southern Hemisphere Fin Whales on the basis of six management areas, Areas I through VI, which are longitudinal pie slices 50°-70° wide. The areas were originally chosen as putative management stocks for Humpback Whales, and later used for all baleen whales, with little or no biological support (Donovan 1991).<br/><br/> Over 725,000 Fin Whales have been recorded caught in the Southern Hemisphere during 1905-76 (Allison 2017). There was a series of assessments in the 1970s, including a synthesis by Chapman (1976) which was reassessed for Area I by Breiwick (1977), and updated for Areas II-VI by Allen (1977). A later reassessment of Area VI Fin Whales was inconclusive (IWC 1980). <br/> <br/> These assessments were based on a combination of evidence, including trends in CPUE by whaling fleets, sighting rates by Japanese scouting vessels, and inferences on recruitment and mortality rates from age and length data. Their reliability is questionable on various grounds. For example, the IWC Scientific Committee subsequently determined that CPUE data should only be used for stock assessments when the nature of the whaling operations is fully described (IWC 1989). A reanalysis of the historical data using modern methods and insights is warranted.<br/> <br/> Regular sightings surveys in the Antarctic south of 60°S were conducted under the IDCR/SOWER programmes in summer during 1978-2010 (IWC 2018) and the JARPA/II (1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> Japanese Research Programmes in the Antarctic) in summer during 1987-2014 (Pastene <em>et al</em>. 2014). However, only 55% of the historic summer catch taken during 1904-76 occurred south of 60°S, the remainder having been taken mainly between 50°-60°S. Hence there is probably considerable abundance outside the surveyed areas.<br/><br/>Circumpolar estimates from the IDCR/SOWER surveys increased from 2,100 during 1978-91 (CV 0.28) to 5,100 (CV 0.52) during 1991-98 (Branch and Butterworth 2001) but the more recent data do not appear to have been worked up. An extrapolation of the abundance estimate for 1978-91 to the area south of 30°S using Japanese Scouting Vessel data from 1978-88 yielded a circumpolar estimate of 15,000 (no variance given) (IWC 1996). The Scouting Vessel data were not collected according to any kind of statistical design and should be interpreted with caution.<br/><br/>Estimates from the JARPA/II surveys covering just half the Antarctic from 35°E to 145°W (southern Indian Ocean and south-west Pacific sectors) increased from 5,000 (CV 0.15) in 1996 to 17,600 (CV 0.26) in 2008, but large inter-annual fluctuations in the abundance suggested that the proportion of the population within the surveyed area varied from year to year (Matsuoka and Hakamada 2014). Approximately three-quarters of the historical catch came from within the 35°E-145°W sector.<br/><br/>Other data sources cover only limited areas and lack long enough time series to estimate trends. As examples, Viquerat and Herr (2017) estimated abundances of about 500 and 800 Fin Whales around Elephant Island and the South Orkneys respectively.<br/><br/>The current circumpolar abundance remains highly uncertain until all existing data are worked up and more data are collected from the zone 50°-60°S. Overall the information suggests a substantial increase has occurred, but the rate of increase is poorly quantified. All estimates of the rate of increase have very low precision but are compatible with an intrinsic growth rate of around 4-5% per year as assumed in the latest assessments.<br/><br/><strong><em>Biological parameters and assessment</em><br/> </strong>Estimates of age at sexual maturity for female Fin Whales, based on observed proportions mature by age, are 6-7 years in the Southern Hemisphere from British catches in the 1960s (Lockyer 1972) and Japanese catches in the 1960s and early 1970s (Mizroch 1981), but these values are likely negatively biased due to selection against smaller animals. For the North Atlantic, Gunnlaugsson <em>et al</em>. (2013) report a value for Fin Whales caught off Iceland of around 8 years during 1965-89, increasing to 14 years during 2006-10, although the sample size in the later years was small. Aguilar <em>et al</em>. (1988) estimated 7.9 years from catches off Spain during 1979-84. There do not seem to be any precise values for the North Pacific, but Kimura (Ohsumi) <em>et al</em>. (1958) estimated 8-12 years. For the purpose of this assessment, the age at first reproduction of 10 years (9 years for age at sexual maturity) as estimated by Taylor <em>et al</em>. 2007 is assumed. The values of other biological parameters (age at first capture, net recruitment rate, and natural mortality rate) were taken from the previous IWC Scientific Committee assessments (IWC 2017, Allen 1977).<br/><br/>The generation time for a non-depleted Fin Whale population is estimated to be 25.9 years (Taylor <em>et al</em>. 2007). The 3-generation window for application of the&#160;Red List&#160;A criterion is 1940-2018.<br/><br/>Because the available published assessments for this Fin Whales are not up to date, an illustrative population assessment is conducted here to enable estimation of a plausible population trajectory over the period 1940-2018 relative to the A criterion. While the available data do not permit a scientifically rigorous estimation of the extent of population reduction, it is reasonable to use conventional population assessment methods to provide a crude indication of the extent of possible reduction relative to the criteria. A conventional deterministic age-structured model with an age at first capture (“recruitment”) and an age at first reproduction, and linear density-dependence was applied to the North Pacific, North Atlantic, and Southern Hemisphere regions separately.<br/><br/>Based on the above (incomplete) information, the following population numbers (total, including immature whales) are assumed for the purpose of this Red list assessment:<br/></p><ul><li>North Atlantic: 70,000 whales in 2015; <br/></li><li>North Pacific: 50,000 whales in 2011; <br/></li><li>Southern Hemisphere: 25,000 whales in 2008.</li></ul><p>The parameter values are listed in Table 1 in the Supplementary Material (which forms an integral part of this assessment). The estimated global trajectory for the number of mature individuals indicates that the 2018 mature population size is about 100,000 whales and may be around 45% of the 1940 level, which implies a classification of Vulnerable under the A1 criterion. According to this trajectory, there had already been considerable decline prior to 1940, especially in the Southern Hemisphere. For completeness it should be noted that other models have been posited that imply an increasing Fin Whale population prior to 1940 in the Southern Hemisphere (Mori and Butterworth 2006) but the pre-1940 period does not affect the Red List assessment against criterion A.</p>",Increasing,"<p>Fin Whales occur worldwide, mainly, but not exclusively, in offshore waters of the temperate and subpolar zones (Edwards&#160; <em>et al</em>. 2015). They show some poleward migration in summer but appear to be present at some level throughout their range throughout the year. Fin Whales are considered rare or absent in most of the tropics but were hunted off Peru and Ecuador and in the Gulf of Guinea in the 20th century (Allison 2017), and are still occasionally observed in the tropics, for example off Peru (Hamilton <em>et al</em>. 2009) and the Seychelles (Keller <em>et al</em>. 1982). There do not seem to remain any confirmed records from the northern Indian Ocean, after correcting misidentifications (Brownell <em>et al</em>. 2017).<br/><br/><strong><em>North Atlantic and Mediterranean</em><br/> </strong>In the North Atlantic, the Fin Whale’s range extends as far as Svalbard (Norway) in the northeast (but rarely far into the Barents Sea), to the Davis Strait and Baffin Bay (Canada and Greenland) in the northwest (but rarely into the inner Canadian Arctic), to the Canary Islands (Spain) in the southeast, and to the Antilles in the southwest (Rice 1998, Perry <em>et al.</em> 1999), but it is rare in the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico (Ward <em>et al.</em> 2001), where the few recorded strandings may be extralimital vagrants (Whitt <em>et al</em>. 2011).<br/><br/>Their main summer range in the northwestern Atlantic extends from Cape Hatteras (U.S.A.) (39°N) northward (Hayes <em>et al</em>. 2017). They occur in summer (and possibly year-round) west and east of Greenland, around Iceland and the Faroe Islands and along the Iceland-Faroes ridge, and to a lesser extent in the Norwegian Sea and around Jan Mayen (Øien 2009). They occur off the northern and western British Isles and in the Bay of Biscay off northwestern Spain but are rare in the North Sea (Hammond <em>et al</em>. 2017). They regularly occur off the Azores in spring (Visser <em>et al</em>. 2011) and have been detected acoustically west of Madeira (32°N) in winter (Castellotti <em>et al</em>. 2011).<br/><br/>While there may be some north-south migration between summer and winter, it appears from acoustic data that at least male North Atlantic Fin Whales are present throughout most of the range throughout the year (Morano <em>et al</em>. 2012).<br/><br/>Fin Whales are present in the central and western Mediterranean, mainly north and east of the Balearic Islands, and appear to be a mixture of a resident population and one migrating between the Mediterranean and the Atlantic (Notabartolo di Sciara <em>et al</em>. 2016). The area of abundance seems to be concentrated in the Ligurian Sea and the Gulf of Lyon in summer, but expands to cover much of the western and central Mediterranean in winter. Fin Whales are rare in the southern and eastern Mediterranean, do not penetrate far into the Adriatic or Aegean Seas, and are not present in the Black Sea. In the 20th century, Fin Whales were caught year-round near the Straits of Gibraltar (Allison 2017) and observations in this century show Fin Whales leaving her Mediterranean through the Strait of Gibraltar&#160; during May-October and (mostly) entering the Mediterranean during November-April (Gauffier <em>et al</em>. 2018); the observations of calves leaving the Mediterranean during May-July suggests they were born there.<br/><br/><strong><em>North Pacific<br/></em></strong>In the eastern North Pacific, Fin Whales occur year-round off the central and southern California coast. They occur in summer off the entire coast of western North America from California into the Gulf of Alaska and along the Aleutian Islands. Fin Whales marked off California in winter were recaptured in summer by whaling operations along the entire coast, suggesting migration (Mizroch <em>et al</em>. 2009). Offshore, Fin Whales occur across the North Pacific north of 40°N, at least from May to September in summer, with some tendency for a northward shift in distribution in high summer, when they enter the Okhotsk Sea (Miyashita <em>et al</em>. 1996, Melnikov <em>et al</em>. 2017) and are also found along the east coast of Kamchatka (Filatova <em>et al</em>. 2017) and between Kamchatka and the Commander Islands (Miyashita 2006). They also occur in the Sea of Japan (Miyashita 2006). Fin Whales occur in the Bering and Chukchi Seas, and have recently been detected as far as Point Barrow in the northeastern Chukchi, which may be an indication of a northward expansion as the Arctic warms (Crance <em>et al</em>. 2015).<br/><br/>Fin Whales are abundant in the offshore western North Pacific north of about 35°N in summer, and in the coastal waters of Hokkaido and northeastern Honshu (Japan) (Matsuoka <em>et al</em>. 2016), but in recent years have only rarely been seen off central and southern Japan or around the Korean peninsula at any time of year (Miyashita <em>et al</em>. 1996, Matsuoka <em>et al</em>. 2017, Sohn <em>et al</em>. 2012). Both are areas where large catches were taken in the 20<sup>th</sup> century.<br/><br/>Fin Whales in the East China Sea are thought to belong to a distinct subpopulation from those of the North Pacific (Fujino 1960), and it is possible that the Korean and southern Japanese catches came from this stock. There were a few net catches in the Yellow Sea and Korea Strait in the early 2000s (CRI 2005-07).<br/><br/>Fin Whales occur, albeit in small numbers, in Hawaiian waters in both summer and winter (Carretta <em>et al</em>. 2017). The winter distribution in the North Pacific poorly known. While there appears to be some migration, acoustic data suggest that overall there is little seasonality in distribution, but that there is seasonality in the amount of vocalization (Watkins <em>et al</em>. 2000, Stafford <em>et al</em>. 2007).<br/><br/>The Fin Whales inhabiting the Gulf of California appear to be a resident, genetically isolated subpopulation (Bérubé <em>et al.</em> 2002). Telemetry information has shown year-round residency in this area, with seasonal latitudinal movements (Urbán <em>et al.</em> 2005).<br/><br/><strong><em>Southern Hemisphere<br/></em></strong>Some Fin Whales penetrate into the high Antarctic, along with Blue (<em>Balaenoptera musculus</em>), Minke (<em>B. bonaerensis</em>) and Humpback Whales (<em>Megaptera novaeangliae</em>), but are rarely seen in the pack ice. The Fin Whale summer distribution also extends into middle latitudes, as evidenced by both sightings and past catches (Miyashita <em>et al.</em> 1996, Allison 2017). Fin Whales were abundant in summer in the Southern Ocean from 40°S to Antarctica in the southeastern Atlantic and southwestern Indian Ocean sectors, and south of 50°-55°S in other sectors. Recent (post-whaling) data on Fin Whales in the Southern Ocean are available mainly for the area south of 60°S: for example, the international circumpolar IDCR/SOWER surveys under the auspices of the International Whaling Commission (IWC) from 1978-2009 (IWC 2019) which showed that Fin Whales were still distributed in all sectors of the Antarctic, but with a much reduced abundance (Branch and Butterworth 2001); more recently, surveys around the South Orkneys and the South Shetlands (Viquerat and Herr 2017, Joiris and Dochy 2013) found substantial local densities of Fin Whales.&#160;An area of suspected high Fin Whale density to the south of Bouvet Island (55°-57°S 0-5°E) was confirmed by a sighting survey conducted there in December 2006 (Ensor <em>et al</em>. 2007).<br/><br/>Large numbers of Fin Whales were caught by whalers operating out of whaling stations on South Georgia (55°S) during 1904-65, but the species was rarely seen there in the ensuing three decades (Moore <em>et al</em>. 1999). Sightings have become more frequent lately but have not yet been quantitatively evaluated (Richardson 2012).<br/><br/>Outside the Antarctic, Fin Whales were caught in substantial numbers off the southwestern and southeastern coasts of southern Africa in winter, and in the early 20<sup>th</sup> century were also taken in the coastal waters of Mozambique, Angola, Congo, and Gabon (Best 1994), but they are very rare on the western coasts of southern and equatorial Africa today (Weir 2010, 2011). Catch rates of Fin Whales off South Africa declined to near zero by the early 1970s coincident with the severe depletion by whaling in the Southern Ocean, which suggests that this was a wintering ground for a population that migrated to the south in summer (Best 2003).<br/><br/>Fin Whales were caught off the coast of Peru, mainly in the austral winter, until catches petered out in the early 1970s. Sightings of Fin Whales in the eastern equatorial Pacific since whaling ended in 1976 have been relatively few, in contrast to Blue Whales which continued to be sighted frequently (Valdivia <em>et al</em>. 1984, Landa <em>et al</em>. 1983, Hamilton <em>et al</em>. 2009).<br/><br/>Fin Whales were caught from several stations along the coast of Chile from 20° to 44°S from the early 20th century until 1983, but very few were caught after 1970. Catches were taken in all seasons but few in winter; the whales were typically small, with a modal length of 16-17m for each sex, compared with 20-21m (males) and 21-22m (females) for Fin Whales caught by Antarctic fleets. Given the lack of genetic distinction between fin whales in Chile and elsewhere in the southern hemisphere (Pérez-Álvarez <em>et al</em>. 2018) and the recovery in the Antarctic of marks placed in Fin Whales off Chile (Clarke 1978), it is likely that the Chilean Fin Whales were juvenile Southern Fin Whales <em></em> rather than a race of small Fin Whales (Cooke 2019). In recent years, Fin Whales have been observed in nearshore Chilean waters from 23° to 29ºS during spring and summer and seen to be feeding there (Pérez <em>et al</em>. 2006, Pacheco <em>et al</em>. 2015, Toro <em>et al</em>. 2016). Toro <em>et al</em>. classed 502 out of 519 Fin Whale sightings around the Chanaral and Choros Islands (29°S) in summer and fall as ""adults"" but used a size criterion of 17m developed for the smaller North Atlantic Fin Whale; hence the ""adults"" could have included whales of any age class except calves of the year. Pacheco <em>et al</em>. reported two mother-calf pairs off northern Chile (Mejillones Bay, 23°S) in spring 2006.<br/><br/>Fin Whales are now rare in Brazilian waters, but there is virtually no information from the period before the depletion of the whales around South Georgia (Zerbini <em>et al</em>. 1997). A few were taken in a brief period of whaling in southern Brazil in the early 1960s.<br/><br/>Apart from the above-mentioned wintering grounds, the winter distribution of Fin Whales in the Southern Hemisphere is poorly known. Some may remain in the far south while some may disperse into oceanic areas in temperate latitudes. Acoustic detections of Fin Whales in the Antarctic peak in the autumn (May) and are absent in winter and spring, but this may reflect seasonality of vocalization as much as presence/absence (Širović <em>et al</em>. 2004).<br/><br/><strong><em>Other areas</em></strong><br/>The only confirmed records from Indonesia are two strandings in 1937 and 1975 (Rudolph <em>et al</em>. 1997), which may have been vagrants. A reported sighting off Sarawak (Malaysia) in 1999 (de Boer 2000) is unconfirmed.<br/><br/>The map shows where the species may occur based on a synthesis of occurrence records and oceanography. States for which confirmed records of the species exist are included in the list of native range states.</p>","<p>Large-scale commercial harvesting of this species appears to have ceased, the last catches having been taken in the Antarctic in 2012 and in the North Atlantic in 2015 (IWC 2018a) but frozen products are probably still in trade. The latest entry in the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) Trade Database was an export of 2,546 tonnes of Fin Whale meat from Iceland to Japan in 2014, but only 1,624 tonnes appear to have reached Japan (CITES 2017).</p>",Marine,"<p>The IWC set catch limits at zero for Fin Whales in the North Pacific and Southern Hemisphere starting in 1976. The IWC adopted a provision (popularly known as the commercial whaling moratorium) in 1982 to set all catch limits for commercial whaling to zero from 1986, but Iceland, Norway, and the Russian Federation have lodged objections or reservations to the provision. Limited hunting of Fin Whales off western Greenland is permitted for “aboriginal subsistence” purposes.<br/><br/>Fin Whales are listed on Appendix I of CITES, but this does not apply to Iceland, Norway, and Japan, who hold reservations. Fin Whales are also listed on Appendices I and II of the Convention on Management of Migratory Species (CMS). Under the Agreement for Conservation of Cetaceans in the Black and Mediterranean Seas, Fin Whales in the Mediterranean, along with other cetaceans, are protected from deliberate killing by signatories to the agreement.</p>",Afrotropical|Antarctic|Australasian|Indomalayan|Nearctic|Neotropical|Oceanian|Palearctic,,false,false,Global
50351457,2763,Berardius bairdii,Least Concern,,2020,2020-08-23 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<p>There is limited global information on abundance and none on trends in abundance for this species. It is relatively common with a broad range endemic to the cold waters of the North Pacific. Trends in abundance have been stable in waters off the U.S. west coast where corresponding trends for mesoplodonts have been negative, possibly due to the effects of anthropogenic noise. Baird’s Beaked Whales are taken in Japan’s small-type whaling operations (annual quota around 60). One Baird’s Beaked Whale was reported as dying from entanglement in the large-mesh gillnet fishery off the western United States; bycatch of ziphiids (beaked whales ) in this fishery has been eliminated through pinger use. Given that this species is relatively common and is known to have persisted in stable numbers within a large portion of its range, it is considered Least Concern. However, it is likely that other subpopulations exist especially around Japan where they are still hunted (Kasuya 2017), and once they are better identified they could be assessed separately.</p>","<p>Though they may be seen close to shore where deep water approaches the coast, Baird's Beaked Whales' primary habitat is on or near the continental slope and near oceanic seamounts (Kasuya 2002) in temperate oceanic waters 1,000 to 3,000 m deep. Off the Pacific coast of Japan, these whales have been recorded in water temperatures ranging between 23°C and 29°C, with a southern limit at the 15°C isotherm at a depth of 100 m.</p><p>Baird's Beaked Whales feed mainly on deepwater and bottom-dwelling gadiform fishes and cephalopods &#160;(Balcomb 1989, Kasuya 2002), as well as some pelagic fishes, such as mackerel, sardines, and saury. The diet off the Pacific coast of Japan consists of 82% fish and 18% cephalopods, while in the southern Sea of Okhotsk the proportions are 13% and 87%, respectively (Walker <em>et al. </em>2002).</p>","<p>Baird’s Beaked Whale is the only species of ziphiid to be commercially hunted (Kasuya and Ohsumi 1984, Kasuya 2017). Small numbers have been hunted by whalers from the Soviet Union, Canada and the United States mainly between 1930s to 1960s, whereas the hunting in Japan has been more consistent and substantial. The Japanese fishery started in the early 1600s and underwent several expansions and declines. At its peak, after World War II, over 300 whales were killed annually.&#160; Between 2005-2013 the quota for small-type whaling was 66/year (10 for the Sea of Japan [Hakodate], 4 for the southern Okhotsk Sea [Abashiri] and 52 for the Pacific coast [Wadaura, Ayukawa] Kasuya 2017).<br/> <br/> Incidental catches are reported infrequently. Some Baird's Beaked Whales have been caught in Japanese salmon driftnets (Ohsumi 1974). Artukhin <em>et al</em>. (2010) reported that beaked whales, most likely this species, were taken as bycatch in Japanese driftnet fishery in the Russian EEZ north of the Commander Islands and the southern part the Sea of Okhotsk. The estimated annual mortality rate in 1992-2008 was 4 (1-7) individuals. The fishery was closed in 2016. One Baird’s Beaked Whale was reported as dying from entanglement in the large-mesh gillnet fishery off the western United States;&#160; bycatch of ziphiids (beaked whales ) in this fishery has been eliminated through pinger use (Carretta <em>et al.</em> 2008).</p>  <p>In recent years, there has been increasing evidence that loud underwater sounds, such as active sonar and seismic operations, can be harmful to beaked whales (Cox <em>et al.</em> 2006). In particular, the use of active sonar from military vessels has been implicated in numerous atypical mass strandings of beaked whales, including <em>Ziphius cavirostris</em> and several <em>Mesoplodon</em> species (Balcomb and Claridge 2001, Wang and Yang 2006, D’Amico <em>et al</em>. 2009, Filadelfo <em>et al.</em> 2009). The exact cause for the strandings is unknown, but stranded individuals sometimes suffer from chronic and acute tissue damage due to <em>in vivo</em> formation of gas bubbles, possibly resulting from decompression sickness (Frantzis 1998, Jepson <em>et al.</em> 2003, Fernández <em>et al</em>. 2005).&#160; One mass stranding event involving Baird’s Beaked Whales is known from Japan and two from Mexico.&#160; Changes in the behavior of Baird’s Beaked Whales in response to simulated sonar have been observed (Stimpert&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2014).&#160; However, off the U.S. west coast where anthropogenic noise has been implicated in declines in mesoplodonts (Moore and Barlow 2013), there was no apparent decline in Baird’s Beaked Whales (Moore and Barlow 2017).&#160; </p>  <p>Ingestion of plastic by marine organisms is a widespread and increasing problem, and possibly a significant cause of mortality among cetaceans, especially beaked whales (Simmonds 2012, Fossi <em>et al</em>. 2018). The specific threats include macroplastic items that can physically block the digestive tract and lead to death (Secchi and Zarzur 1999), and microplastics (&lt;5 mm; Baulch and Perry 2014, Lusher <em>et al.</em> 2015) that can leach toxic chemicals (Baini <em>et al.</em> 2017).</p>  <p>Organochlorine residues have been identified in other beaked whales (see Miyazaki <em>et al.</em> 1987) and such residues represent a potential health hazard. In Baird’s Beaked Whales, Subramanian <em>et al.&#160;</em>(1988) reported values for PCBs and DDE , which are low when compared to other toothed whales. Organochlorine and halogenated dimethylbipyrroles residues have been identified in Baird’s Beaked Whales (Prudente <em>et al. </em>1997, Haraguchi <em>et al. </em>2006) and various other species of mesoplodonts beaked whales&#160; (Kajiwara <em>et al.</em> 2006, Bachman <em>et al.</em> 2014, Anezaki <em>et al. </em>2016). <br/> <br/> Predicted impacts of global climate change on the marine environment may affect this species of whale, given its cool-temperate to sub-Arctic habitat preference, although the nature of likely impacts is unclear (Learmonth <em>et al</em>. 2006).</p>","Three subpopulations of Baird’s Beaked Whales are recognized in the western North Pacific (Sea of Japan, Okhotsk Sea, and Pacific Ocean), where these whales have been exploited in the Pacific coast of Japan for centuries. However, nothing is known about population structure in the eastern and central North Pacific. &#160;Abundance in Japanese waters has been estimated at about 7,100 individuals (5,029 off the Pacific coast, 1,468 in the eastern Sea of Japan, and 663 in the southern Okhotsk Sea – Kasuya 2017). These are likely underestimates because the analysis methods did not account for whales missed due to their long dive times (Barlow 1999). A trend-based analysis of line-transect data from all surveys conducted off the U.S. west coast between 1991 and 2014 yielded an estimate of abundance of 2,697 (CV=0.60) whales (Moore and Barlow 2017) and an apparently stable trend. Barlow (2016) estimated Baird’s Beaked Whale abundance in the California Current at 5,394 (CV=0.83) and 7,960 (CV=0.93) whales for surveys conducted in 2008 and 2014, respectively. These estimates are higher than previously-published estimates for this region because they include lower estimates of trackline detection probability, g(0), based on Beaufort sea state-specific estimates of detectability for <em>Mesoplodon</em> species (Barlow 2015).",Unknown,"<p>Baird's Beaked Whales are found in deep oceanic cold-temperate waters of the North Pacific Ocean and the adjacent&#160;Okhotsk and Bering Seas. Their range extends to the southern Gulf of California, Mexico, in the east and central Honshu, Japan, in the west. They also occur in the vicinity of drift ice in the northern Sea of Okhotsk. Off the Pacific coast of Japan, they migrate into waters over the continental slope from May to October, but where they go in winter is not known. They also occur in the northern Sea of Japan south to the Korean Peninsula. Their distributional limits in oceanic waters of the mid-Pacific are also not well known (Balcomb 1989, Kasuya 2002).</p>",This species is hunted for food in Japan.,Marine,"<p>To date, the question of whether the International Whaling Commission (IWC) has the competence to classify or set catch limits for this species has not been formally resolved, even though Baird’s Beaked Whale is included in the IWC definition of ""bottlenose whale"".

Combining the most current abundance estimates for the various subpopulations results in a total of more than 195,000 whales. Given that there are no estimates for most of the Russian High Arctic, total abundance is likely more than 200,000. At least four subpopulations number more than 20,000 individuals. Some subpopulations are reduced below historical levels and some small subpopulations are declining but data are not adequate to assess overall population reduction or trend. As a species, Beluga Whales do not meet any IUCN criteria for threatened categories and are listed as Least Concern.</p>  <p>Belugas in Cook Inlet have been assessed by IUCN as a separate subpopulation and are classified on the Red List as Critically Endangered (Lowry <em>et al</em>. 2012). Several other subpopulations are small, declining, and/or occupy restricted areas, and warrant Red List assessment at the subpopulation level.</p>","Belugas are relatively well-studied as a result of carcass sampling conducted in association with hunting (Heide-Jørgensen and Teilmann 1994, Suydam 2009) along with a considerable amount of satellite-linked radio-tracking (Richard <em>et al</em>. 1998a,b, Richard <em>et al</em>. 2001, Lydersen <em>et al</em>. 2001, Heide-Jørgensen <em>et al</em>. 2003a, Hobbs <em>et al</em>. 2005), and aerial survey efforts (Moore, 2000, Belikov and Boltunov 2002, Innes <em>et al</em>. 2002). <br/> <br/> Belugas occupy estuaries, continental shelf and slope waters, and deep  ocean basins in conditions of open water, loose ice, and heavy pack ice  (Hauser <em>et al</em>. 2017). In summer, they are found in coastal waters as shallow as 1–3 m deep and also in offshore waters thousands of meters deep. They typically enter estuaries and sometimes move upstream into rivers; there are records of individuals or small groups ranging hundreds of kilometers from the sea (Kleinenberg <em>et al</em>. 1964). Belugas generally prefer to overwinter in areas with light or highly moveable ice cover (Barber <em>et al</em>. 2001, Richard <em>et al</em>. 2001, Suydam <em>et al</em>. 2001, Heide-Jørgensen <em>et al</em>. 2003a, Citta <em>et al</em>. 2017) and may occur as fully Arctic subpopulations (Richard <em>et al</em>. 1998b, <em></em> 2001; Suydam <em>et al</em>. 2001) or Subarctic subpopulations (Hobbs <em>et al</em>. 2005). <br/> <br/> Some Belugas undertake large-scale annual migrations between summering and wintering sites (Hauser <em>et al</em>. 2014), while others remain in the same area year-round, shifting offshore only when excluded from coastal habitat by fast-ice formation (Hobbs <em>et al</em>. 2005). Large numbers of migratory Belugas occur along the northwestern and northern Alaskan coast, in the Canadian high Arctic, and in western Hudson Bay. At certain times of the year, those whales migrate thousands of kilometers, in some cases as far as 80°N into dense pack ice (Suydam <em>et al</em>. 2001) or thousands of kilometers into the North Water polynya or to the pack ice off West Greenland (Richard <em>et al</em>. 1998a,b, Richard <em>et al</em>. 2001, Heide-Jørgensen <em>et al</em>. 2003). In some areas, beluga distribution appears to be determined by sea ice extent, with belugas shifting offshore during low-ice years to maintain associations with the marginal ice zone (Heide-Jørgensen <em>et al.</em> 2010). Non-migratory Belugas that generally make seasonal shifts in distribution of less than a few hundred kilometers are found in Cook Inlet, Cumberland Sound, Svalbard, and the St. Lawrence Estuary (Lydersen <em>et al</em>. 2001, Kingsley 2002, Hobbs <em>et al</em>. 2005). <br/> <br/> While the general features of Beluga Whale habitat can be described for the relatively well-studied subpopulations, the importance of those features is not well understood (Laidre <em>et al</em>. 2008). For example, the summer occupation of nearshore/estuarine waters has been ascribed alternatively to feeding (Seaman <em>et al</em>. 1982), to warm water providing a thermal advantage to neonates (Sergeant and Brodie 1969), and to the presence of fresh water and coarse substrates facilitating skin shedding during molt (St. Aubin <em>et al</em>. 1990, Frost <em>et al</em>. 1993). The relative importance of each of those factors likely varies according to the environmental conditions (e.g., water temperatures and prey availability) specific to each of the summering areas (Frost and Lowry 1990). Similarly, it is unclear why Belugas sometimes move into deep, ice-covered waters (Hauser <em>et al</em>. 2016). One potential reason would be to avoid predation by Killer Whales (<em>Orcinus orca</em>) (Frost <em>et al</em>. 1992). However, movements into the ice appear excessive for what would be needed to avoid Killer Whales (Suydam <em>et al</em>. 2001) and actually could expose Belugas to predation by Polar Bears (<em>Ursus maritimus</em>) (Lowry <em>et al</em>. 1987) as well as increase the risk of entrapment in the ice. It is possible that Belugas move into ice-covered offshore regions for feeding, primarily on Arctic Cod (<em>Boreogadus saida</em>), but few data are available to test this hypothesis (Hauser <em>et al</em>. 2015). Similarly, the associations of Belugas with features such as the continental shelf break and slope (Moore 2000, Hauser <em>et al</em>. 2017) may be related to biophysical processes that produce good feeding conditions (Laidre <em>et al</em>. 2008).<br/> <br/> Beluga dives may last more than 20 minutes and can reach depths of more than 900 m (Hauser <em>et al</em>. 2015). The Beluga has a diverse diet, which varies greatly from area to area. Although various species of fish are considered to be the primary prey items (including Salmon (<em>Oncorhynchus </em>spp.), Herring (<em>Clupea </em>spp.), and Arctic Cod), Belugas also feed on a wide variety of mollusks (such as squid and octopus) and benthic crustaceans (shrimps and crabs) (Quakenbush <em>et al</em>. 2015, Kleinenberg <em>et al</em>. 1964). Polar Bears and Killer Whales are known predators of Belugas throughout their Arctic range (Frost <em>et al</em>. 1992).","<p>The Conservation of Arctic Flora and Fauna (CAFF) Arctic Biodiversity Assessment (CAFF 2013) lists threats to arctic marine mammals as harvest, loss of sea ice, human activities, pollution, and disease. Belugas are susceptible to all those threats, but their importance varies among the many Beluga subpopulations.</p><p>Hunting for human consumption is the biggest known threat to Belugas  across certain portions of their range. The most immediate concerns  relate to continuing harvests from small and depleted subpopulations (IWC  2000). The strong philopatry of Belugas, which causes them to return to  the same estuaries year after year, makes them highly vulnerable to  overexploitation. This behavioural trait is undoubtedly the most  important natural factor that has led to the extirpation of Belugas from  some parts of their range by a combination of commercial and  subsistence hunting (e.g., in southwestern Greenland and some river  mouths in Ungava Bay, Canada). In nearly all regions hunting is now  being controlled by limiting takes to sustainable levels (see  the <em>Conservation Actions</em> section).<br/> </p>  <p></p><p>Ongoing climate change is resulting in substantial reduction in the seasonal extent and thickness of sea ice in the Arctic (Comiso 2012, Stroeve <em>et al</em>. 2012), as well as changes in timing of sea ice formation and breakup (Laidre <em>et al</em>. 2015). Belugas occur only in regions where sea ice occurs at least seasonally, suggesting a strong connection with sea ice influenced habitat. However, Belugas from some subpopulations spend many months in open water far from any ice while others spend most of their time in regions with sea ice concentrations up to 90%, indicating that the species as a whole has substantial flexibility in its relationships with ice (Hauser <em>et al</em>. 2017). Belugas that occupy ice covered areas may do so for feeding on abundant ice-associated species such as Arctic Cod (<em></em>Loseto <em>et al</em>. 2009, Hauser <em>et al</em>. 2015). Changes in the distribution and characteristics of sea ice will result in changes in productivity and prey species types and abundance (Laidre <em>et al</em>. 2008, Haug <em>et al</em>. 2017) but the potential costs or benefits to Belugas of such changes are not known. Killer Whales are known predators of Belugas (Frost <em>et al</em>. 1992) and it is generally assumed that concentrated sea ice provides Belugas some degree of refuge from predation. There is good evidence that Killer Whales are expanding their range in Arctic regions where sea ice has been declining (Higdon and Ferguson 2009, Ferguson <em>et al</em>. 2010). Belugas are susceptible to entrapment when sea ice conditions change rapidly and if they cannot escape they may die or be preyed upon by Polar Bears <em></em> and/or humans (Lowry <em>et al</em>. 1987, Heide-Jørgensen <em>et al</em>. 2002). <br/></p>  <p>Known or potential threats include a variety of human activities in addition to hunting, and climate change is allowing increases in the scale and distribution of some of those activities in areas previously covered with heavy ice. Ongoing and expanding oil and gas development, along with commercial shipping, is likely to impact habitats used by Belugas. Such impacts may be especially acute in shipping routes such as the Northwest Passage which traverses much of the summering habitat of belugas in Canada and Greenland (Reeves <em>et al</em>. 2014). Areas such as the Mackenzie Delta, West Greenland, and the Barents Sea are subject to oil and gas exploration and development, which may include seismic surveys, offshore drilling, and artificial island construction, accompanied by icebreaking and shipping. Much of this activity is undertaken in the summer months in the same areas occupied by Belugas. In a study of responses of Belugas to icebreaking ships, the whales typically moved rapidly along ice edges away from approaching ships and showed strong avoidance reactions to approaching ships at distances of 35–50 km (Finley <em>et al</em>. 1990, Erbe and Farmer 2000). Expansion of commercial fisheries into new Arctic regions may have implications for bycatch of Belugas in fishing gear and depletion of Beluga prey resources. Construction of dams for hydroelectric development in the Hudson Bay area and along the north shore of the Gulf of St. Lawrence may have affected Belugas because of their dependence on estuarine conditions (Smith <em>et al</em>. 2017).</p><p> Pollution from industrial and other sources is pervasive in the world’s oceans and marine mammals are known to accumulate levels of contaminants from those sources that are high enough to cause impacts on health (Ross 2000). Threats from contaminants are of concern for Belugas in some areas. High levels of several contaminants have been found in Belugas sampled in the Canadian Arctic (Braune <em>et al</em>. 2005). Studies of the SLE Beluga subpopulation have found that concentrations of both total polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and chlorinated PCB congeners are much higher than in Belugas in the Arctic. Some scientists believe that the increased occurrence of opportunistic bacterial infections, parasitic infestation, gastric ulcers and other disorders in SLE Belugas is evidence of a link between immune system dysfunction and PCB exposure (Martineau <em>et al</em>., 1994). SLE Belugas also have elevated tissue levels of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (flame retardants) (Lebeuf <em>et al</em>. 2004). </p>  Like other marine mammals, Belugas are exposed to a number of diseases that may influence their population status (Gulland and Hall 2005). Significant epizootics have not been recorded in Belugas, but serological screenings document pathogen exposure (e.g., Alekseev <em>et al</em>. 2009) and necropsies find a variety of health issues (e.g., Martineau <em>et al</em>. 1988). Lefebvre <em>et al</em>. (2016) found low level exposure to biotoxins (domoic acid 2 of 15 tested and saxitoxin 1 of 12 tested) in Beluga samples from Cook Inlet. A mass mortality event in summer 2008 in the SLE, which included several Belugas, was linked to an intense bloom of the toxic dinoflagellate <em>Alexandrium tamarense</em> (Starr <em>et al.</em> 2017).  Burek <em>et al</em>. (2008) described ways in which climate change could impact disease exposure for arctic marine mammals.","<p></p><p>The global Beluga population consists of multiple subpopulations with varying degrees of differentiation and abundance (hereafter the terms subpopulation and stock are used interchangeably). Due to the lack of sampling, particularly in Russia, the total number of subpopulations is not precisely known.<em> </em>In 1999, the International Whaling Commission’s (IWC) Scientific Committee organized information on Belugas on the basis of 29 provisional management stocks (IWC 2000), and a recent (March 2017) Global Review of Monodontids hosted by the North Atlantic Marine Mammal Commission (NAMMCO) developed a list of 21 stocks (NAMMCO in prep.).<br/></p>    <p>Stocks are generally based on nearshore areas (principally fjords, bays, and estuaries) where Belugas congregate during part of the open water season. Satellite telemetry, genetic studies, and organochlorine analyses have shown that Belugas have strong matrilineally driven fidelity to those areas (O’Corry-Crowe <em>et al</em>. 1997, 2002; Richard <em>et al</em>. 2001, de March <em>et al</em>. 2002, Innes <em>et al</em>. 2002, Palsbøll <em>et al</em>. 2002). Some stock boundaries overlap spatially and seasonally during winter and during the spring and fall migrations (Hauser <em>et al</em>. 2014). For stocks that winter in the Bering Sea, limited satellite tracking data suggest that areas used generally do not overlap in the same year, suggesting that Belugas from different stocks have traditional winter ranges that are mostly exclusive (Citta <em>et al</em>. 2017). <br/></p>  <p>While good abundance estimates are available for some Beluga subpopulations, the sizes of others are virtually unknown or only roughly approximated (Laidre <em>et al</em>. 2015). Available information is summarized below. <br/></p>  <p><strong>Okhotsk Sea</strong></p>  <p>Belugas occur in two well-separated regions of the Okhotsk Sea.<em> </em>In the northeastern region, they summer along the coast and in estuaries of Shelikhov Bay and winter along the ice edge of the Bay and northwestern Kamchatka.<em> </em>Based on surveys in 2010, Shpak and Glazov (2013) estimated there were 1,333 surface-visible Belugas in the northeastern Okhotsk Sea, resulting in an estimate of 2,666 total whales when corrected for availability bias (animals not seen because they were diving). In the western Okhotsk Sea, Belugas occur in the northern Sakhalin Bay and Amur River region as well as several smaller bays along the Shantar coast (Ulbansky Bay, Udskaya Bay, Tugursky Bay and Nikolskaya Bay.<em> </em>There Shpak and Glazov (2013) estimated 4,780 visible Belugas and 9,560 in total. The population trend is unknown in both regions. <br/></p>  <p><strong>Alaska and Western Canada</strong></p>  <p>Five subpopulations of Belugas are known to occur in the Bering, Chukchi, and Beaufort seas. All five winter in the Bering Sea (Citta <em>et al</em>. 2017). The eastern Chukchi Sea and eastern Beaufort Sea subpopulations migrate northward in spring and spend summer and early fall well north of Bering Strait (Richard <em>et al</em>. 2001, Suydam 2009, Hauser <em>et al</em>. 2014), while the Bristol Bay, Anadyr Gulf, and eastern Bering Sea subpopulations remain in the Bering Sea south of Bering Strait (Citta <em>et al</em>. 2016, NAMMCO in prep., Alaska Beluga Whale Committee (ABWC) unpublished data). </p>  <p>Bristol Bay Belugas have been counted using aerial surveys conducted periodically between 1993 and 2016.<em> </em>Correction factors to account for animals missed were applied to counts made in 2004 and 2005 (Lowry <em>et al. </em>2008) which produced an abundance estimate of 2,887 whales (Muto <em>et al. </em>2016).<em> </em>Similar correction factors applied to the 2016 count resulted in a population estimate of 3,166 whales (ABWC unpublished data). Lowry <em>et al. </em>(2008) reported that counts of Bristol Bay Belugas increased by 4.8% per year during 1993-2005 (95% confidence interval (CI) 2.1–7.5%). The estimate based on 2016 counts was similar to 2004/05 suggesting that the increasing population trend had leveled off (ABWC unpublished data). </p>  <p>Belugas in Anadyr Gulf have never been surveyed adequately. An analysis of Beluga sightings obtained opportunistically during a survey for Pacific Walruses (<em>Odobenus rosmarus divergens</em>) conducted in the western Bering Sea in April 2006 estimated 15,125 Belugas in the area (with availability correction factor applied). However, the survey did not cover all areas known to be used by Anadyr Belugas, and it is possible that individuals from other subpopulations were also in the survey area. The maximum count along the coast in Anadyr Bay was 241 whales, and expert opinion suggests that the total Anadyr subpopulation is about 3,000 whales with fairly stable abundance (NAMMCO in prep.). </p>  <p>Aerial surveys for Belugas were flown in the eastern Bering Sea periodically during 1992-2001. Data collected in 2000 were used in distance sampling analysis that resulted in an estimate of 3,497 surface-visible Belugas in the survey area. The total abundance estimate was 6,994 whales (95% CI 3,162-15,472) when a correction factor for availability was applied (Lowry <em>et al</em>. in press). There are currently no data with which to estimate population trend, but another survey of the subpopulation was conducted in 2017. </p>  <p>Early estimates of the size of the eastern Chukchi Sea Beluga stock relied on June-July counts of whales in and near coastal lagoons with correction factors applied to account for animals missed.<em> </em>Those studies resulted in abundance estimates of roughly 2,000-4,000 whales (Seaman <em>et al</em>. 1988, Frost <em>et al</em>. 1993, Muto <em>et al</em>. 2016).<em> </em>Subsequent tagging of whales with satellite depth recorders (SDRs) showed that during summer they had a very broad distribution, including considerable time spent in offshore areas where they were missed during coastal lagoon surveys (Suydam 2009). Further analysis of SDR data from eastern Chukchi Sea and eastern Beaufort Sea Belugas (Hauser <em>et al</em>. 2014) showed there is a date range and region where data from offshore marine mammal surveys (Aerial Surveys of Alaskan Marine Mammals (ASAMM); Clarke <em>et al</em>. 2013) could be used to estimate abundance of the eastern Chukchi subpopulation.<em> </em>That analysis (Lowry <em>et al</em>. 2017) estimated there were 5,547 (CV 0.22) surface-visible Belugas in the study area in 2012. Data from SDRs were used to develop correction factors to account for animals that were missed because they were outside of the study area or diving too deep to be seen, resulting in a total abundance estimate of 20,752 whales (CV 0.70). Trend in abundance is unknown but there are several other years of ASAMM survey data that could be analyzed to look for changes over time. <br/></p>  <p>The most recent estimate of abundance for the eastern Beaufort Sea Beluga stock is 39,258 whales (Muto <em>et al</em>. 2016).<em> </em>This number was derived from aerial surveys conducted in the Mackenzie Delta and eastern Beaufort Sea in 1992 that estimated 19,629 (CV 0.23) surface visible Belugas (Harwood <em>et al</em>. 1996) and a correction factor to account for submerged whales.<em> </em>Synoptic surveys for Belugas were conducted in the region only in 1992, but Beluga sightings were recorded during offshore Bowhead Whale (<em>Balaena mysticetus</em>) surveys in 1982, 1984, 1985, and 2007-09. The number of Belugas counted at the surface was substantially higher during the 2007-09 surveys but it is unclear whether this was due to a shift in distribution or population increase (Harwood and Kingsley 2013). <br/></p>  <p>An isolated subpopulation of Belugas occurs in Cook Inlet, Alaska where they reside throughout the year (Hobbs <em>et al</em>. 2005, Goetz <em>et al</em>. 2012, Shelden <em>et al</em>. 2015a). Sightings are occasionally made outside of Cook Inlet in the Gulf of Alaska (Laidre <em>et al</em>. 2000), and there is a small group (&lt; 20 animals) that is apparently resident in Yakutat Bay approximately 600 km to the east (O’Corry-Crowe <em>et al</em>. 2015) and is considered to be part of the Cook Inlet stock (Muto <em>et al</em>. 2016). Beluga abundance in the Inlet, including corrections for availability and sightability, is determined using aerial counts and video analysis of whale groups (Hobbs <em>et al</em>. 2000). The 2014 survey produced an estimate of 340 whales (CV 0.08; Shelden <em>et al</em>. 2015b).<em> </em>Abundance declined by nearly 50% between 1988 and 1994, and by about 1.3%/year during 1994-2014 (Hobbs <em>et al</em>. 2015, Shelden <em>et al</em>. 2015b). <br/></p>  <p><strong>Eastern Canada and Greenland</strong></p><p>There are currently three main population centers for Belugas in Arctic Canada, High Arctic-Baffin Bay (HA-BB), Cumberland Sound, and Hudson Bay. A subpopulation that once occurred in southwest Greenland in winter is likely extirpated (NAMMCO in prep.). HA-BB Belugas summer mostly in nearshore waters around Somerset Island (Koski and Davis 1980, Smith and Martin 1994) and winter in northern Baffin Bay and off West Greenland (Doidge and Finley 1993, Heide-Jørgensen and Laidre 2004). An aerial survey of the Canadian High Arctic in summer 1996 produced an availability-adjusted abundance estimate of 21,213 whales (95% CI 10,985-32,619; Innes <em>et al</em>. 2002).<em> </em>A 2012 winter survey off West Greenland resulted in a corrected estimate of 9,072 Belugas (CV 0.32) (Heide-Jørgensen <em>et al</em>. 2017). Modeling by Innes and Stewart (2002) indicated a major decline in HA-BB Beluga abundance occurred between 1981 and 1994.<em> </em>Current trend in abundance is unknown. </p>  The Cumberland Sound Beluga subpopulation remains in the Cumberland Sound area throughout the year (Richard and Stewart 2008). Aerial surveys were conducted in typically used portions of the Sound in 2014, and abundance was estimated using a combination of visual surveys and photographic counts.<em> </em>The total abundance estimate (corrected for availability bias) was 1,151 whales (95% CI 761–1,744; Marcoux <em>et al</em>. 2016). Marcoux and Hammill (2016) constructed a model of this subpopulation using survey data collected during 1980-2014 and harvest data for 1920-2015.<em> </em>Results indicated that current abundance is substantially reduced compared to 1960 and that abundance is still declining.          <p>Four Beluga stocks occur in the Hudson Bay region.<em> </em>The eastern Hudson Bay (EHB) and western Hudson Bay (WHB) stocks summer in the regions for which they are named and winter principally in Hudson Strait (NAMMCO in prep.). Although some interbreeding occurs on the wintering grounds (Turgeon <em>et al</em>. 2012), genetic studies show that the two groups are distinct (deMarch <em>et al</em>. 2003). Colbeck <em>et al</em>. (2012) found that cultural transmission of migration routes exists which likely acts to minimize interchange between the groups.<em> </em>Systematic aerial surveys of EHB Belugas have been flown seven times since 1985. Surveys flown in 2015 produced an availability-corrected estimate of abundance of 3,819 whales (CV 0.43; Gosselin <em>et al</em>. 2017). Modeling of the series of survey estimates and harvest data for 1972-2016 indicates that abundance declined during 1974-2002, but has been stable since then (Hammill <em>et al</em>. 2017). Abundance of WHB Belugas was most recently estimated from visual and photographic aerial surveys flown in summer 2015. The availability-corrected estimate of total abundance was 54,473 whales (95% CI 44,988-65,957; Matthews <em>et al</em>. 2017).<em> </em>Because of bad weather conditions, this estimate did not include the Ontario coast where nearly 15,000 whales were estimated in 2004 (Richard 2005). A comparison of surface abundance estimates from 2015 and 2004 for five strata surveyed in both years showed that 2015 counts were about 6% higher (NAMMCO in prep.). Belugas use James Bay in large numbers during the summer and remain in that region during winter (Bailleul <em>et al</em>. 2012).<em> </em>The 2015 aerial survey estimated availability-corrected abundance as 10,615 (CV 0.25; Gosselin <em>et al</em>. 2017).<em> </em>Estimates from similar surveys conducted from1985 to 2011 ranged from 4,720 to 19,439 whales so the trend in abundance is unclear. Belugas were once abundant in Ungava Bay, with summer aggregations in and near several rivers.<em> </em>Numbers are now greatly diminished with no animals sighted on-transect during aerial surveys conducted there since 1983 (NAMMCO in prep.).<em> </em>However, some Belugas still occur occasionally in the area as indicated by off-transect sightings during aerial surveys (Kingsley 2000) and land-based sightings (Doidge <em>et al</em>. 1994). Using data from surveys conducted during 1985-2008, Doniol-Valcroze and Hammill (2012) estimated Ungava Bay Beluga abundance to be 32 individuals (95% CI 0-94).   </p><p>&#160;A relict subpopulation of Belugas occurs in the Saint Lawrence River estuary (SLE) that is isolated from all other subpopulations both geographically and genetically (Brown Gladden <em>et al</em>. 1999; de March and Postma 2003). Both the core range used in summer and the total range of SLE Belugas have shrunk considerably since the 1930s (Mosnier <em>et al</em>. 2010). The size of the SLE subpopulation is believed to have declined from 7,800 whales in the 1866 to about 1,000 in 1985 (Hammill <em>et al</em>. 2007).<em> </em>Abundance has been monitored since 1988 using photographic aerial surveys.<em> </em>An integrated population model using survey counts and vital rates indicated that abundance increased slowly between the 1960s and early 2000s then declined to an estimated 889 in 2012 (Mosnier <em>et al</em>. 2015). <br/></p>  <p><strong>Svalbard and Russian Arctic </strong></p>  <p>The Svalbard Beluga subpopulation is geographically isolated and genetically differentiated from subpopulations to the east and west (O’Corry-Crowe <em>et al</em>. 2010). During the ice-free season Belugas in the archipelago are found very nearshore, often at the faces of glaciers (Lydersen <em>et al</em>. 2001).<em> </em>During winter, sea ice formation causes them to move offshore somewhat but they remain in the Svalbard area (Lydersen <em>et al</em>. 2002).<em> </em>Currently there is no abundance estimate for Svalbard Belugas but the first ever survey was to be conducted in summer 2017 (NAMMCO in prep.). <br/></p>  <p>The Beluga subpopulation in the White Sea is genetically differentiated from other subpopulations (NAMMCO in prep.).<em> </em>In summer, the whales are seen in several aggregation areas in the major bays (Andrianov <em>et al</em>., 2009, Glazov <em>et al</em>. 2010a, Alekseeva <em>et al</em>., 2012). While some investigators believe that in winter Belugas move to the Barents Sea, they are seen in the White Sea in March (Glazov <em>et al</em>. 2010b) and all of the Belugas tracked with satellite-linked tags have stayed in the White Sea (Glazov <em>et al</em>. 2012, Svetochev and Svetocheva 2012, Kuznetsova <em>et al</em>. 2016). Aerial surveys for belugas were flown in the White Sea in July six times during 2005-2011. The abundance estimate for 2011 was 5,593 whales (CV 0.14), and estimates from prior years ranged from 5,009 to 7,464 (Solovyev <em>et al</em>. 2012a). Available data suggest that abundance is stable. <br/></p>  <p>Belugas have been recorded at many other locations along the Arctic coast of Russia, including the Kara, Barents, Laptev, and East Siberian seas as well as Nova Zemlya and Franz Josef Land (Kleinenberg <em>et al</em>. 1964, Solovyev <em>et al</em>. 2012b). A compilation of observations made during 1958-1995 from sea ice reconnaissance flights showed many sightings in coastal and offshore waters from the Barents Sea to the Kara Sea but few observations in the East Siberian Sea (Belikov and Boltunov 2002). Boltunov and Belikov (2002) considered that the primary summer habitats are near Franz Josef Land and in the Kara Sea and western Laptev Sea, and that most of Belugas from this region winter in the Barents Sea. There are no estimates of current abundance, but given the size of the area and the number of animals taken by historical whaling (Boltunov and Belikov 2002), it is likely that Belugas were once numerous there.<em></em><br/></p><p><strong>Population Summary</strong></p><p>Summing the various estimates above gives a total of approximately 195,000 Belugas in the surveyed subpopulations. Because no abundance estimates are  available for Svalbard and the Russian High Arctic and the estimate for the White Sea is not corrected for availability, it is nearly certain that total rangewide abundance is more than 200,000. Taylor <em>et al</em>. (2007) calculated that in a pristine Beluga population 68% of all individuals would be mature. Using that value the total number of mature Belugas is estimated at about 136,000. The number of mature Belugas in the largest subpopulation, WHB, is about 37,000.</p><p>  </p><p>  </p><p>Generation time is an important parameter for several of the IUCN Red List criteria, and calculations of generation time require an accurate method for determining or estimating ages of individuals. For Beluga Whales, this has been done primarily by counting layers in the teeth of harvested or stranded animals. Counts of growth layer groups (GLGs) have usually been converted to age in years assuming there were two GLGs formed each year (Brodie 1971, Sergeant 1973, Burns and Seaman 1988, Heide-Jørgensen <em>et al</em>. 1994). Formation of two GLGs per year was supported by examination of teeth from captive, known age, individuals (Brodie 1982, Goren <em>et al</em>. 1987, Heide-Jørgensen <em>et al</em>. 1994). Stewart <em>et al</em>. (2006) measured the incorporation of atomic bomb radiocarbon into Beluga tooth GLGs, and used those measures to estimate age. When those estimates were compared to ages based on formation of one GLG versus two GLGs/year, the data fit the one GLG/year assumption. Lockyer <em>et al</em>. (2007) examined 10 teeth from captive Belugas and found clear support for one GLG/year in six of the specimens, but results for the others were equivocal.  Hohn <em>et al</em>. (2016) considered that the bomb radiocarbon study and long-term photoidentification studies showed that GLG deposition is “unquestionably annual.” (also see Matthews and Ferguson 2014). However, Brodie <em>et al</em>. (2013) continued to argue for two GLGs/year, based on field observations of Beluga life history parameters in Cumberland Sound, captive animal studies, and suggested problems with studies that support one GLG/year. Using the assumption of two GLGs/year, Taylor <em>et al</em>. (2007) estimated generation time for belugas as 16.4 years for a population in a pre-disturbance state. If one GLG/year is actually the case, generation time would be much longer, but calculations using that assumption have not been done.</p><span lang=""EN-CA""><p>Data on historical sizes of Beluga subpopulations are sparse. Innes and Stewart (2002) estimated the historical carrying capacity (K) of the HA-BB  subpopulation as 39,790 whales. Bettridge <em>et al</em>. (2016) estimated K for Sakhalin - Amur Belugas as between 13,200 and 20,800. Cumberland Sound Belugas were estimated to number 3,100 in 1960 (Marcoux and Hammill 2016). Hammill <em>et al</em>. (2017) estimated that there were 6,663 Belugas in EHB in 1974. Abundance of                    Cook Inlet Belugas  in 1979 was estimated at 1,293 (NMFS 2003). Hammill <em>et al</em>. (2007) estimated that there were 7,800 Belugas (standard error 600) in the SLE in 1866. Comparing these figures with those for the most recent abundance estimates given above suggests a reduction of 88% for SLE belugas, and 28-74% for the other five subpopulations. While these comparisons show that some stocks have been substantially depleted and remain in that state, a species-wide reduction in abundance cannot be calculated. The difficulty of such a calculation is compounded by the lack of agreement on calibration of tooth layers for age estimation, which is central to determining generation length and the amount of depletion over time. The combined abundance of those six subpopulations known to be depleted constitutes less than 20% of the current species-wide abundance estimate, and there is no reason to think that all of the remaining subpopulations are similarly depleted.    </p><span lang=""EN-CA""></span>",Unknown,"<p>Kleinenberg <em>et al</em>. (1964) correctly noted that “The Beluga is widely distributed throughout the northern seas.”<em> </em>More recent and more detailed mapping (e.g., Reeves <em>et al</em>. 2014) confirms that Belugas are widely distributed in Arctic regions, occurring nearly throughout northern waters of Russia, Alaska, Canada, West Greenland, and Svalbard. Gaps in the distribution occur off North and East Greenland and perhaps in central Russia. Sightings and telemetry studies show that Belugas occur north of 80° N latitude at Svalbard (Vacquié-Garcia <em>et al</em>. 2017), and north of western Russia (Belikov and Boltunov 2002) and Alaska (Suydam <em>et al</em>. 2001).<em> </em>Subpopulations in the Okhotsk Sea and the Gulf of Saint Lawrence occur in Subarctic waters as far south as 50° N (Shpak <em>et al</em>. 2010) and 47° N (Lefebvre <em>et al</em>. 2012) respectively. Belugas have been recorded as vagrant at Japan, New Jersey and Washington State USA, Iceland, Faroe Islands, Ireland, Scotland, France, the Netherlands, and Denmark (Rice 1998).</p>","<p></p><p>In the past Belugas were hunted commercially at several locations but that is no longer the case. They are legally hunted for food by indigenous communities in several parts of their range, including western and northern Alaska (Frost and Suydam 2010), western and eastern Canada (Harwood <em>et al</em>. 2002, Mosnier <em>et al</em>. 2017), some parts of Russia (D. Litovka pers. comm.), and Greenland (Heide-Jørgensen and Rosing-Asvid 2002, Heide-Jørgensen <em>et al</em>. 2017). Legally-harvested Beluga products may be sold in Alaska Native communities. Some illegal hunting may also occur, particularly in parts of Russia (NAMMCO, in prep.). Russia allows Belugas in the White Sea and in the Sakhalin Bay - Amur River delta region to be live-captured for public display.<em> </em>Numbers taken in the White Sea are small (probably 5-6 or fewer per year, NAMMCO, in prep.).<em> </em>The number live-captured at Sakahlin is more substantial, 0-81 per year during 2000-2017 (Shpak and Glazov 2014, NAMMCO, in prep.). Reeves <em>et al</em>. (2011) calculated the sustainable annual removal of Belugas from the Sakhalin subpopulation to be 29 whales. Records of historical kills were used in a population model to estimate that the Sakhalin - Amur subpopulation meets the definition of depleted under the U.S. Marine Mammal Protection Act, which disallows imports for live display into the U.S. (Bettridge <em>et al</em>. 2016).&#160; <br/></p>",Marine,"<p>Although Belugas were hunted intensively on a commercial basis for oil and leather in many parts of their range during the 20th century, the only known direct removals at present are for food (subsistence use) and the aquarium trade. The Canada-Greenland Joint Commission on Conservation and Management of Narwhal and Beluga (JCNB) is expected to ensure the conservation of shared stocks of Belugas while NAMMCO is a regional management body to which Canada, Greenland, and Norway belong. Catch limits and other recommendations on conservation of belugas are made on the basis of advice from joint meetings of the JCNB’s Scientific Working Group and NAMMCO’s Scientific Committee Working Group on the Population Status of Narwhal and Beluga in the North Atlantic. Catch levels from hunted Beluga subpopulations range anywhere from less than ten to a few hundred animals per year. There is concern that Cumberland Sound Belugas are being hunted at unsustainable levels (NAMMCO, in prep.).<em> </em>Removals from the Bristol Bay, Eastern Bering Sea, Eastern Chukchi Sea, and Eastern Beaufort Sea subpopulations are considered sustainable (Muto <em>et al</em>. 2016). In both Canada (Richard and Pike 1993) and Alaska (Adams <em>et al</em>. 1993), indigenous peoples’ organizations have entered into co-management agreements with government agencies to work on conservation of Beluga stocks. Harvests from the Eastern Beaufort Sea subpopulation occur in both Alaska and Canada, and that is managed by an agreement between the North Slope Borough (Alaska) and the Inuvialuit Game Council (Canada).</p><p></p><p>As a species, the Beluga is listed on Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species.

They are primarily bottom feeders and are thus restricted to shallow continental shelf waters for feeding. They are largely coastal although they do occur at greater distances from shore on the shallow continental shelf of the Bering and Chukchi seas (Rice and Wolman (1971). Gray whales feed primarily on swarming mysids, tube-dwelling amphipods, and polychaete tube worms in the northern parts of their range, but are also known to take red crabs, baitfish, and other food (crab larvae, mobile amphipods, herring eggs and larvae, cephalopods, and megalops larvae) opportunistically or off the main feeding grounds (Nerini 1984). In one of their main feeding grounds in the Chukchi Sea, Gray Whale densities were highest in areas with high benthic amphipod abundance (Brower <em>et al</em>. 2016). Gray Whale feeding may have a dramatic effect on benthic invertebrate communities (Oliver and Slattery 1985). <br/><br/>Gray Whales are often preyed upon by Killer Whales, <em>Orcinus orca</em> (Lowry <em>et al</em>. 1987, Matkin <em>et al</em>. 2007).","<p></p><p>  </p><p>Gray Whales have been hunted since prehistoric times, and were particularly vulnerable to whalers due to their slow swimming speeds and coastal distribution. The North Atlantic population was extinct by the early 1700s, although it is unclear whether this was due primarily to hunting (Mead and Mitchell 1984). Gray Whales were hunted in prehistoric times on both sides of the North Pacific, but aboriginal catches declined to relatively low levels by the early 20th century due largely to depletion of the stocks by commercial whaling (Mitchell 1979).</p>  <p></p>  <p>Over-exploitation had been thought to have caused the extinction of the western North Pacific breeding population by the 1970s (Bowen 1974) but its probable continued existence in some form is noted above. The eastern North Pacific breeding population had reached such low numbers by the end of the 19th century that commercial whaling ceased, but it has now recovered to at or near carrying capacity, its abundance showing some fluctuation in response to environmental conditions. </p>  <p>Gray Whales are subject to anthropogenic threats such as entanglements in fishing gear and ship strikes. Scordino <em>et al</em>. (2017) estimated about 10 fatalities per year in the eastern North Pacific and the Bering Sea resulting from known incidents during 2010-15, of which ~80% involved entanglement in fishing gear and ~20% from ship strikes. The threat seems small in relation to the population size of 25,000-30,000 animals, but there are fisheries with little observer coverage, such as the Alaska gillnet fisheries, such that total mortality rates may be higher (Carretta <em>et al</em>. 2017).&#160; </p>  <p>Entanglement rates in the western North Pacific appear to have been comparatively high relative to abundance: out of only 18 records of Gray Whales on the Pacific coast of Japan during 2000-16, there were 10 live sightings, 4 entanglements, and 4 strandings (Kato <em>et al</em>. 2016). No further entanglements in Japanese waters have been reported since 2008 when Gray Whales in Japan acquired legal protection against deliberate killing and commercial utilization, but it is unclear whether this is coincidental. A Gray Whale death from entanglement was recorded in the Taiwan Strait in 2011 (Wang <em>et al</em>. 2015).<br/></p>  <p>Salmon trap nets have been set at least since 2013 in Gray Whale  feeding grounds off northeastern Sakhalin, with at least one observed entanglement and at least one probable entanglement death (Lowry <em>et al</em>. submitted). Based on analysis of photographs, approximately 20% of Gray Whales observed off Sakhalin during 1995-2005 showed evidence of scarring from past entanglements (Bradford <em>et al</em>. 2009), but it is not known where the scars were acquired. <br/></p><p></p><p>  </p><p></p><p></p><p>  </p><p><span lang=""EN-US"">Seven to eight times more gray whales than average washed ashore on the US coast in 1999 and 2000, but the causes of this unusual mortality event have not been conclusively identified (Gulland <em>et al</em>. 2005).</p>  Perryman <em>et al</em>. (2002) and Salvadeo <em>et al</em>. (2015) showed that Gray Whale  calf production is positively correlated with the length of the ice-free season in the main feeding grounds in the preceding season. While this would imply that reduced ice coverage, as predicted by most climate models, could benefit Gray Whales in the short term, the longer term effects of arctic climate change on Gray Whales are unknown. There is some evidence that the distribution on the winter breeding grounds shifts northward in warm (El Niño) years and southward in cool (La Niña) years (Salvadeo <em>et al</em>. 2015). This trend seems to have continued in 2015 and 2016, with lower Gray Whale counts in the more southerly Bahia Magdalena Lagoon complex (24-25°N) compared to the previous years and with water temperatures 2.0-3.5° higher than in 2012-13 (Urbán <em>et al</em>. 2016). The conservation implications in the context of a general trend towards higher water temperatures and more frequent El Niño conditions are unclear.<p></p>  Plastic debris has been found in stomachs of dead Gray Whales but does not appear to have been a significant factor in the deaths of the individuals concerned.","<p></p><p>Gray Whales in the eastern North Pacific were rapidly depleted by commercial whalers after the wintering concentrations in lagoons along the Baja California peninsula, Mexico, were discovered in the mid-19th century. Peak catches, averaging over 480 whales per year, occurred between 1855 and 1865. Lagoon whaling ended by about 1875, apparently due to exhaustion of the lagoon populations, but shore-based whaling in California continued at a lower level until the late 19th century (Henderson 1984, IWC 1993, Reeves and Smith 2010). In the 20th century, there were some pelagic catches off California and Mexico by Norwegian and American vessels in the 1920s and 1930s, and in the 1930s and 1940s by the Soviet pelagic fleet in the Bering and Chukchi seas (Allison 2017). A further 320 Gray Whales were taken under scientific permit in the 1960s (Rice and Wolman 1971), and 138 illegal Soviet catches occurred in the 1960s (Doroshenko 2000). “Aboriginal subsistence” whaling resumed in the Bering and Chukchi seas off Chukotka in 1948 and has continued into the present, apart from an interruption in the early 1990s. Reported catches during the years 1985-2016 averaged 118 per year. Very small numbers have also been taken by aboriginal whalers in Alaska, and by the Makah tribe in Washington State (IWC 2017). <br/></p>  <p>Despite the continuing catches, the eastern North Pacific population has recovered strongly from past over-exploitation, increasing by 2.5% per year during 1967-96 (Buckland and Breiwick 2002). Abundance seems to have peaked around 1997/98 when a census on the southward migration indicated a population of 24,000-36,000 (Laake <em>et al</em>. 2012). There followed a reduction in population size, with some recovery in recent years. The most recent abundance estimate is 26,960 (95% confidence interval 24,420-29,830) from the 2015/16 southbound migration survey off California (Durban <em>et al</em>. 2015, 2017).&#160; <br/></p>  <p>There was a downturn in population condition around the turn of the millenium involving poor calf production, high stranding rates, and relatively high numbers of emaciated animals (LeBouef <em>et al.</em> 2000, IWC 2003, Rugh <em>et al.</em> 2005). An observed die-off involved at least 651 whales between 1999 and 2001 (Thomas <em>et al</em>. 2016). Perryman <em>et al.</em> (2002) showed that calf production was related to the proportion of feeding habitat free of sea ice in the preceding summer. Since 2002, calf production has recovered, and mortality and the occurrence of emaciated whales have declined (IWC 2004). The presence of female-calf pairs has also recently increased in Laguna San Ignacio, Baja California Sur (Swartz <em>et al</em>. 2012). The population has probably reached a size where it exceeds the carrying capacity of the environment in years when food availability is below average, and is likely to fluctuate around some environmentally determined average level.</p><p>The Pacific Coast Feeding Group (PCFG) was estimated at 243 whales (standard error 19) in 2015 and has shown some increase in recent years (Calambokidis <em>et al</em>. 2017).&#160; <br/></p>The combined feeding aggregations off northeastern Sakhalin and southeastern Kamchatka were estimated to number 271-311 whales (excluding calves) in 2016, of which 175-192 were predominantly Sakhalin-feeding whales. The Sakhalin component has been increasing at 2-5% per year. Based on evidence of migration to the eastern North Pacific from tags and photo-identification matches between Sakhalin/Kamchatka and Mexico, it was estimated that at most 100 of the Sakhalin/Kamchatka whales migrate to wintering grounds in the western North Pacific (Cooke 2017). <p>Given documented catches of about 2,000 gray whales in Korean waters  during 1890-1966 (Kato and Kasuya 2002), and the lack of sightings in  Korean waters since 1977, the western breeding population, if it still  exists, is likely at a very small fraction of its original abundance.<br/></p>",Stable,"<p></p><p>  </p><p>Gray Whales are now regularly found only in the North Pacific and adjacent seas. They congregate in winter in or around various lagoons along the west coast of Baja California (Mexico) and small numbers also occur in winter in the Gulf of California and along the Mexican mainland. Some calves are born during the southward migration and the remainder are born in shallow bays and lagoons on the west coast of Baja California (Jones and Swartz 2002). In spring, the population migrates to feeding grounds mainly in the shallow waters of the northwestern Bering Sea and the southern Chukchi and Beaufort seas, with some individuals migrating as far westward as Kamchatka and Sakhalin, Russia (Weller <em>et al.</em> 2012, Mate <em>et al</em>. 2015). Some Gray Whales also summer and feed along the Pacific coast of North America from northern California to Kodiak Island, Alaska; those animals are known as the Pacific Coast Feeding Group (PCFG) (Carretta <em>et al</em>. 2017).</p>  <p></p>Former whaling grounds off Korea and southwestern Japan indicate the existence of a separate western North Pacific or Asian population that migrated to breeding grounds south of the Korean Peninsula, based on the seasonality of catches in the Korean grounds (Weller <em>et al</em>. 2002, Kato and Kasuya 2002). The last sighting in Korean waters was in 1977, and recent surveys in Korean waters have failed to find any Gray Whales (Kim <em>et al.</em> 2013). <br/><br/>Gray Whales, including mothers with calves, return every year to a feeding ground off northeastern Sakhalin (Weller <em>et al</em>.  1999). This group was until recently thought to be a remnant of the  western breeding stock that was exploited in the Korean whaling grounds;  the Russian name “Korean-Okhotsk gray whale” for this population was  based on this assumption. Tracking with satellite-linked tags and  photo-matching data (Mate <em>et al</em>. 2015, Weller <em>et al</em>.  2012) show that at least some of the Sakhalin whales migrate to the  eastern North Pacific in winter. However, the number of movements  recorded to date has not been sufficient to conclude that all Gray  Whales observed off Sakhalin belong to the eastern breeding population  (Cooke <em>et al.</em> 2017, IWC 2017).  <br/>  <p>Since 1990, about 30 sightings and strandings have been documented in Japan, mainly on the Pacific coast (Kato <em>et al</em>. 2016). These include at least one reproductive female moving between Sakhalin and Japan and one individual seen in successive years alternately off Sakhalin in summer and off Japan in winter and spring (Weller <em>et al</em>. 2016, Nakamura <em>et al</em>. 2017). There have also been a few strandings on the coast of mainland China from the northern Yellow Sea to the Hainan Strait in the south (Zhu and Yue 1998), and one animal caught in fishing gear in the Taiwan Strait in 2011 (Wang <em>et al</em>. 2015). Therefore, at least some of the Gray Whales that feed in the Okhotsk Sea migrate into Japanese waters and possibly farther south in winter;&#160;these may be a remnant of the historical Asian Gray Whale population, but it is not known whether there exists an Asian calving and nursery aggregation, as occurs in Baja California. <br/> <br/> Gray Whales were once present in the North Atlantic as well as the North Pacific. Sub-fossil remains, the most recent dated to around 1675, have been found on the eastern seaboard of North America from Florida to New Jersey and on the coasts of the English Channel and the North and Baltic seas (Mead and Mitchell 1984). There are historical accounts of living Gray Whales from Iceland in the early 1600s and possibly off New England in the early 1700s (Rice 1998). </p>  A few rare occurrences of Gray Whales outside their normal range have recently been documented. One was seen in May 2010 in the Mediterranean Sea off Israel, and a few days later again off Spain (Scheinin <em>et al.</em> 2011). A Gray Whale was found stranded on the coast of El Salvador in July 2010, the southernmost record known in the Pacific Ocean (previously, the southernmost record was in Bahía de Banderas, Mexico) (Barraza 2011). A Gray Whale was seen in May 2013 off Namibia, possibly a juvenile and the only report to date of a Gray Whale in the Southern Hemisphere (Elwen and Gridley 2013).","<p>Commercial whaling of Gray Whales has ceased, but aboriginal subsistence whaling continues, primarily off Chukotka with a few taken in some years in Alaska. The IWC permitted a catch of 744 Gray Whales during the years 2013-18 with a maximum of 140 in any one year.</p>",Marine,"<p>Gray Whales have been protected from commercial whaling by the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling since its entry into force in 1948, and by its predecessor convention since 1936. Limited aboriginal subsistence whaling is permitted by the IWC, and catch limits have been set since the 1970s on the basis of advice from its Scientific Committee (most recently under its new aboriginal subsistence whaling management procedure) and requests from the relevant governments (Russian Federation and U.S.A.). The current (2013-2018) catch limit for the eastern subpopulation is 744 for the six years, subject to a maximum of 140 in any single year (IWC 2017). </p>  Three Gray Whale breeding lagoons in Mexico (Laguna Ojo de Liebre, Laguna San Ignacio, and Laguna Guerrero Negro) enjoy some protection in the form of limitations on boating, fishing, and coastal development, originally as National Gray Whale Refuges, now through their inclusions in the El Vizcaino Biosphere Reserve, which is also listed internationally as a UNESCO World Heritage Site and a Ramsar protected wetland (Hoyt 2005).<br/> <br/> The Gray Whale has a measure of legal protection in Russian waters through inclusion in the Russian Federation Red Book of Threatened Species: the Korean-Okhotsk subpopulation is listed as Endangered while the eastern North Pacific population, which migrates in Russian waters in summer, is listed as “Recovery and Restoration”. The Gray Whale has been legally protected in Japan since 2008: deliberate killing and commercial utilization are prohibited.

50355227,9249,Globicephala macrorhynchus,Least Concern,,2018,2018-06-18 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<p>The Short-finned Pilot Whale is a highly social species with a wide distribution in tropical and temperate waters around the globe. It is relatively common and abundant in some areas. The difficulty of distinguishing this species from the Long-finned Pilot Whale (<em>Globicephala melas</em>) at sea in areas where the two species’ ranges overlap compounds the problem of obtaining reliable estimates for such areas. The total of all available abundance estimates for Short-finned Pilot Whales is approximately 700,000 but large parts of the species range have not been surveyed and therefore actual abundance must be considerably greater than this. Information on trends in abundance at the global scale is lacking but a lack of threats over much of the range does not suggest declining trends.<br/><br/>The Short-finned Pilot Whale was listed&#160;on the IUCN Red List&#160;as Data Deficient in 2008 and the species remains data-poor in much of its range, especially in the Southern Hemisphere and in large parts of the tropical and warm temperate North Atlantic Ocean. However, these whales are widely distributed in warm waters of all oceans, they appear to be relatively abundant in many parts of their range, and no threats are considered significant or pervasive throughout the range of the species. There is no indication of large-scale mortality (other than by mass stranding, which is characteristic of both species of <em>Globicephala</em>) or population declines at present, and therefore the species is listed as Least Concern. The species has been hunted in Japan for many centuries and this continued exploitation may well have caused a significant decline in at least the near-shore waters of Japan.</p>","<p>Short-finned Pilot Whales are typically found in deep waters over the outer continental shelf or continental slope and are generally nomadic although resident or at least semi-resident populations have been documented in Hawaii (Van Cise<em> et al.</em> 2017), the Madeira Islands, and coastal California (Olson 2018). They occur in tropical to cool temperate waters, warmer than those preferred by Long-finned Pilot Whales which off the east coast of the United States were primarily found in sea surface temperatures &lt;22°C and were uncommon in temperatures &gt;25°C (Garrison and Rosel 2017).<br/><br/>In 1982–83, a strong El Niño event brought about major ecosystem changes off the southern California coast, an event linked with the virtual disappearance of Short-finned Pilot Whales from the area for a number of years (Barlow 2006). The species’ current distribution in the area is thought to be linked to seasonal and annual fluctuations in temperature and productivity (Forney and Barlow 1998, Barlow and Forney 2007, Pardo<em> et al.</em> 2013).<br/><br/>Off the coast of Japan, the southern form of Short-finned Pilot Whale occurs within the warm Kuroshio Current and Kuroshio Counter Current, while the range of the northern form is limited to a smaller area within the cold, nutrient-rich Oyashio Current (Kasuya 2017). Pilot whales are primarily adapted to feeding on squid, with reduced tooth counts associated with suction feeding (Werth 2000), and some populations demonstrate deep, fast dives in pursuit of large, high calorie squid species (Aguilar Soto<em> et al.</em> 2008, Olson 2018). On the east coast of the United States, stranded Short-finned Pilot Whales were recorded to feed on a wide range of prey items, including the oceanic Common Arm Squid (<em>Brachioteuthis riisei</em>) as well as other predominantly oceanic squid and fish species (Mintzer<em> et al.</em> 2008). In contrast neritic squid of the genus <em>Loligo</em>&#160;were more commonly found in the stomachs of Short-finned Pilot Whales on the west coast of the United States (Sinclair 1992).</p>","<p>The Short-finned Pilot Whale has been exploited for centuries in the western North Pacific. The largest catches have recently occurred off Japan, where a few hundred are taken annually by hand- or crossbow-projected harpooning, driving, and small-type whaling (defined as the use of a cannon mounted on a vessel below a certain size) (Kasuya 2018). Catches from all cetacean hunts in Japan have been compiled since 1972 and the southern form comprises the vast majority of all Pilot Whale catches, which from 1972 to 2009 have annually ranged from 100 to about 500 (Kasuya 2017). From 1993-2004, the annual quota for all Short-finned Pilot Whale takes in Japan was 500, a large proportion of which was allocated to the drive hunt in Taiji. Since 1972, the largest reported catch in Taiji was 605 in 1980, and after that time catches in Taiji have ranged from tens of animals to several hundred, and the number taken has in general declined. The decline was assumed to be due to the low availability of animals (Kasuya 2017). The coastal population of southern-form whales is at least locally depleted and the coastal populations of both forms are listed as Rare (equivalent to Red List category Near Threatened) in the Japanese Red Data Book (Ohdachi <em>et al</em>. 2009).<br/><br/>Short-finned Pilot Whales (called Blackfish locally) were regularly hunted for food as recently as the 1980s at several Caribbean islands (e.g., St. Vincent and the Grenadines, St. Lucia, Dominica, Martinique), although recent and past documentation has been sporadic and often incomplete (Caldwell and Caldwell 1975, Price 1985, Reeves 1988). The hunt has continued at least in St. Vincent and the Grenadines, where since 1962 the local hunters took an average of 141 Pilot Whales and 159 dolphins of various species annually through 2009 (Fielding 2013).<br/><br/>Dolar <em>et al</em>. (1994) reported on directed hunting of marine mammals in central and southern Visayas, northern Mindanao, and Palawan, Philippines. Hunters at four of the seven investigated fishing villages took cetaceans, including Short-finned Pilot Whales, for bait or human consumption. However, interview surveys conducted in these villages in 2012 indicated that the practice had ceased by that time, in part due to fear of legal prosecutions after the passing of Fisheries Administrative Order 185 banning direct cetacean takes in 1992 (L. Dolar pers. comm. 2018). Large deliberate catches of Short-finned Pilot Whales (&gt;500 in 1996-97) in ‘tiger nets’ in Indonesia were reported in the early 2000s (Perrin <em>et al</em>. 2005) but it was not clear whether this exploitation (for pet food) was continuing. The villages of Lamalera and Lamakera on two remote islands in the Savu Sea in Indonesia have conducted regular hunts for Sperm Whales (<em>Physeter macrocephalus</em>) and other species, including Short-finned Pilot Whales, since the 1600s, and the practice continues today, although numbers of Pilot Whales taken are not available (Mustika 2006, Emont 2017).<br/><br/>It is likely that Short-finned Pilot Whales are killed in moderate numbers in longline and drift gillnet fisheries throughout their range, but there is very little documentation from most range states. This species was noted to be the major depredator of longlines around Fiji (Donoghue<em> et al.</em> 2003). Short-finned Pilot Whales were one of the species documented as occasionally interacting with tuna fisheries in the western tropical Indian Ocean (Romanov 2002. Escalle<em> et al.</em> 2015). Around the island of Mayotte (northeastern Mozambique Channel), there is evidence of interaction between Short-finned Pilot Whales and long-line fisheries, inferred from non-lethal injuries on dorsal fins and information from fishermen (Kiszka <em>et al.</em> 2008). An unknown number are taken incidentally by large-mesh driftnets in Taiwan (Perrin<em> et al.</em> 2005).<br/><br/>Short-finned Pilot Whales are known to be incidentally taken in a deep-set longline fishery that targets primarily tunas in Hawaiian waters (Bradford and Forney 2014, Carretta<em> et al.</em> 2014) and also in a drift gillnet fishery off California (Carretta<em> et al.</em> 2017). Bycatch of Short-finned Pilot Whales is more significant on the east coast of the United States where the estimated mean annual total estimated fisheries-related serious injury and mortality in the period of 2010-2014 was estimated at 233 (CV 0.24) and is cause for concern under provisions of the U.S. Marine Mammal Protection Act (Hayes<em> et al.</em> 2017). The most common human-related cause of death observed in waters off Puerto Rico and the U.S. and British Virgin Islands was ‘entanglement and accidental captures’, followed by gunshots and spear wounds (Mignucci-Giannoni<em> et al.</em> 1999).<br/><br/>Like beaked whales and other deep diving species, Short-finned Pilot Whales are likely to be vulnerable to loud anthropogenic sounds, such as those generated by naval sonar and seismic surveys (Cox<em> et al.</em> 2006, Weir 2008). While conclusive evidence of cause and effect are often lacking, some Short-finned Pilot Whale mass stranding events have been spatially and temporally associated with high levels of anthropogenic sound (Hohn<em> et al.</em> 2006, Parsons 2017). Around Taiwan and adjacent areas, a series of unusual strandings of Short-finned Pilot Whales coincided with large-scale military exercises in 2004, but whether these strandings were related to the exercises is unknown (Wang and Yang 2006, Yang<em> et al.</em> 2008).<br/><br/>Moderate levels of various contaminants have been found in the blubber of Short-finned Pilot Whales, including mercury, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and chlorinated pesticides (DDT, DDE, dieldrin, etc.) (Gaskin<em> et al.</em> 1974, Simmonds<em> et al.</em> 2002). In Japan and St. Vincent and the Grenadines, levels of mercury, PCBs, dieldrin, and other contaminants in the blubber and meat from Pilot Whales and other species killed for food were considered above recommended levels for human consumption (Simmonds<em> et al.</em> 2002, Fielding and Evans 2014).</p><p></p>","<p>Estimates of abundance for Short-finned Pilot Whales exist for several areas. Line transect surveys in Japanese waters generated an abundance estimate of 53,609 (coefficient of variation (CV) 0.22) for the southern form (Miyashita 1993) and an estimate of 4,321 (CV 0.61) for the northern form (IWC 1992). Dolar <em>et al</em>. (2006) estimated abundance for two areas in the Philippines: the eastern Sulu Sea, 7,492 (CV 0.29) and the Tañon Strait, 179 (CV 0.96). A line transect survey in the Eastern Tropical Pacific in 2000 generated an estimate of 589,000 (CV 0.26) Short-finned Pilot Whales, with a steadily increasing trend during the eight surveys that were conducted between 1986 and 2000, although immigration and emigration and slightly changing survey areas may also have influenced numbers from one year to the next (Gerrodette and Forcada 2002). Shipboard line-transect surveys of the Hawaiian Islands Exclusive Economic Zone&#160;(EEZ)&#160;in 2010 yielded an abundance estimate of 19,503 (CV 0.49) (Bradford<em> et al.</em> 2017). Trend data for Pilot Whales in this region are not available due to broad and overlapping confidence intervals between this and previous estimates (Carretta<em> et al.</em> 2017). The best recent estimate for Short-finned Pilot Whales off the west coast of the USA is 836 (CV 0.79), based on the geometric mean of estimates from 2008 and 2014 summer/autumn vessel-based line-transect surveys of California, Oregon, and Washington waters (Barlow 2016). The species was more abundant in this area prior to a strong El Niño event that resulted in apparent ecosystem changes in 1982-83, and it is unknown whether the animals present in smaller numbers now are part of the same population that was present before the 1980’s (Carretta<em> et al.</em> 2017). A summer 2009 oceanic survey covering waters from the 200 m isobath to the seaward extent of the U.S. EEZ in the Gulf of Mexico resulted in an estimate of 2,415 Short-finned Pilot Whales (CV 0.66) (Waring<em> et al.</em> 2016). Two line transect surveys conducted in the summer of 2011 in the western Atlantic from central Florida to the lower Bay of Fundy yielded an estimate of 21,515 (CV 0.37) (Palka 2012. Garrison and Rosel 2017). Because this 2011 survey was the first in this region to distinguish between&#160;Short-finned and Long-finned Pilot Whales&#160;where the species overlap in range (Rone and Pace 2012, Garrison and Rosel 2017), comparison with earlier estimates to assess trends is not possible (Hayes<em> et al.</em> 2017).<br/><br/>Short-finned Pilot Whales are among the most frequently encountered cetaceans in the Canary Islands, although absolute estimates of abundance are not available (Carrillo <em>et al. </em>2010). They have been described as ‘relatively abundant’ around the Maldives and in the northern Indian Ocean more generally (Ballance and Pitman 1998, Clark<em> et al.</em> 2012). Although there has been limited survey effort, the compiled records suggest that Short-finned Pilot Whales occur regularly in deep water off the west coast of Africa (Weir 2010).<br/><br/>While the estimates presented here give insight into abundance for some populations, there is no information on global numbers or trends (Olson 2018).</p>",Unknown,"<p>Short-finned Pilot Whales are found in warm temperate to tropical waters, generally in deep offshore areas. They do not usually range north of 50°N or south of 40°S (Olson 2018). There is some distributional overlap with Long-finned Pilot Whales, which occur primarily in cold temperate to subpolar waters of the North Atlantic and Southern Hemisphere (Hayes<em> et al.</em> 2017, Olson 2018).<br/><br/>Two forms of Short-Finned Pilot Whale are found off Japan with partially overlapping distributions (Kasuya <em>et al</em>. 1988, Van Cise<em> et al.</em> 2016). There is only one confirmed record of the species in the Mediterranean Sea (Notarbartolo di Sciara 2016, Verborgh<em> et al.</em> 2016), and records from the southern Red Sea are considered uncertain and unconfirmed (Notarbartolo di Sciara <em>et al.</em> 2017). There are no confirmed accounts of <em>Globicephala</em> in the Persian Gulf (Leatherwood<em> et al.</em> 1991, de Boer<em> et al.</em> 2003, Preen 2004).

These dolphins appear to favour continental slope habitat but also occur at lower densities in oceanic and continental shelf waters. The sum of existing abundance estimates is about 350,000 individuals, but as these estimates are from only a small fraction of the total distribution range of the species, actual abundance is likely much higher. Threats that may be causing declines include bycatch in offshore gillnets, pelagic longlines, and other fishing gear. There is little quantitative information on bycatch rates, but it is clear that this species is taken in small or moderate numbers in several countries throughout its range. However, given its wide distribution and considerable abundance, and in the absence of evidence that threats are significant throughout the species’ extensive range, the Risso’s Dolphin is assessed on the IUCN Red List as Least Concern. There is not enough information to rule out the possibility that the global population has declined by 30% or more over three generations (60 years; Taylor <em>et al</em>. 2007) and if that were the case it would qualify for listing as Vulnerable. Therefore, further monitoring is encouraged and this assessment should be regarded as provisional, pending better information particularly regarding incidental mortality in fisheries.","<p>Risso’s Dolphins inhabit deep oceanic and continental slope waters, generally 400-1,000 m deep (Baumgartner 1997, Hartman 2017, Jefferson <em>et al</em>. 1993, 2014). They frequent sub-surface seamounts and escarpments, where they are thought to feed on vertically migrant and mesopelagic cephalopods. In Monterey Bay, California, Risso's Dolphins are concentrated over areas with steep bottom topography (Kruse 1989). Currents and upwelling causing local increases in marine productivity may enhance feeding opportunities, resulting in the patchy distribution and local abundance of this species worldwide (Kruse <em>et al</em>. 1999). Davis <em>et al</em>. (1998) and Baumgartner (1997) reported that in the Gulf of Mexico, Risso's Dolphins were mostly found along the upper continental slope, which may reflect mesopelagic squid distribution. Most records of Risso’s Dolphins&#160;in Britain and Ireland are within 11 km of the coast. They are known to occur during summer in shallow (occasionally &lt;10m in depth) coastal waters where they feed on Common Cuttlefish (<em>Sepia officinalis)</em> along the French coast of the English Channel (Kiszka <em>et al</em>. 2004).<br/><br/>Long-term changes in the occurrence of Risso’s Dolphins in some areas (e.g., off Catalina Island and in central California) have been linked to ocean conditions and movements of spawning squid (Kruse <em>et al</em>. 1999). Risso's Dolphins mostly feed on mesopelagic and benthic cephalopods, including squid, cuttlefish and octopus (Cockroft <em>et al. </em>1993). In the few areas where feeding habits have been studied, they appear to feed mainly at night (Spitz <em>et al. </em>2011, Wang <em>et al. </em>2012). Risso’s Dolphins likely take advantage of the circadian vertical movements of their prey, particularly mesopelagic squid (Soldevilla <em>et al. </em>2010).</p>","<p>In Sri Lanka, Risso's Dolphins were, at least during the 1980s, the third most commonly taken cetacean in fisheries, providing meat for human consumption and fish bait (Leatherwood and Reeves 1989, Leatherwood 1994). Around 15% of the estimated 9,000 cetaceans landed annually in Sri Lanka between 1984-1986 were Risso’s Dolphins, most of them having been caught in gillnets or harpooned (Leatherwood 1994). In Japan, Risso's Dolphins are taken regularly by hand harpoon and driving, in set nets, and as a limited catch in the small-type whaling industry, with reported catches in recent years ranging from about 250–500 (Kasuya 2018). In 2007/2008, 246 Risso’s Dolphins were reported to have been taken by the harpoon fishery operating off Hokkaido, Sanriku, Boso, and Kii (Kazuya 2018). They are also a major target of artisanal hunting and are taken incidentally in gillnets and other fishing gear in the Philippines and China (Dolar 1994, Dolar <em>et al</em>. 1994, Perrin <em>et al.</em> 2005). Off eastern Taiwan, Risso’s Dolphins are taken opportunistically by harpoon and they are caught incidentally in large-mesh driftnets for large pelagic fish (Perrin <em>et al.</em> 2005). In 2012, several groups of Risso’s Dolphins were intentionally killed in the Faroe Islands (Bloch <em>et al. </em>2012) where Long-finned Pilot Whales (<em>Globicephala melas</em>) and Atlantic White-sided Dolphins (<em>Lagenorhynchus acutus</em>) are the primary targets of the drive hunt for cetaceans.<br/><br/>Bycatch occasionally occurs in pelagic longline fisheries in the southwestern Indian Ocean and along the U.S. Atlantic coast, particularly since Risso’s Dolphins regularly depredate squid used as bait (Garrison 2007, Kiszka 2015). Between 2011 and 2012, several Risso’s Dolphin deaths were recorded in the pelagic longline fishery based in La Reunion (Sabarros <em>et al. </em>2013). In Tanzania, bycatch has been recorded in drift gillnet fisheries targeting tuna, billfish, sharks, and other large pelagic fish off Zanzibar and Pemba (J. Kiszka, unpublished data). Bycatch in gillnets has also been documented in Ghana, the Azores, Peru, and the Solomon Islands (Bearzi <em>et al. </em>2011, Debrah <em>et al.</em> 2010, Reeves <em>et al. </em>2013). Bycatch rates of Risso’s Dolphins in the Swordfish and Thresher Shark gillnet fishery off California are considered relatively low based on observer data (Carretta and Enriquez 2012).<br/><br/>Like beaked whales (Ziphiidae), which are also deep-divers that prey on cephalopods, Risso’s Dolphins are likely susceptible to disturbance by loud anthropogenic sound, such as that generated by military sonar and seismic surveys (Cox <em>et al. </em>2006, Modest 2015, Southall <em>et al</em>. 2016). They are also exposed to disturbance by whale-watching boats (Visser <em>et al. </em>2011).<br/><br/>Risso’s Dolphins in the Mediterranean carry substantial contaminant burdens (Kim <em>et al</em>. 1996, Marsili and Focardi 1997).</p>","<p>There are no estimates of global abundance for Risso’s Dolphins, but there are estimates for some specific areas. Surveys off California in 1991 and 1992 found estimated abundance to be almost an order of magnitude higher in winter (N=32,376, coefficient of variation (CV)=46%) than in summer (N=3,980, CV=57%) (Forney and Barlow 1998). The current stock assessment for this species along the Pacific coast of the U.S. was calculated from the geometric mean of estimates from 2008 and 2014 summer/autumn vessel-based line-transect surveys to give an abundance estimate of 6,336 (CV=32%) animals (Barlow 2016). Shipboard line-transect surveys of the Hawaiian Islands Exclusive Economic Zone in 2010 resulted in an abundance estimate of 7,256 (CV=41%) (Bradford <em>et al.</em> 2013, Carretta <em>et al.</em> 2017). Based on surveys conducted from 1986 to 1990, 175,800 (CV=38%) Risso’s Dolphins were estimated in the eastern tropical Pacific (Wade and Gerrodette 1993). The best abundance estimate for Risso’s Dolphins in U.S. waters of the western North Atlantic is 18,250 (CV=46%) based on surveys in 2011 (Hayes <em>et al.</em> 2016), with an additional 1,589 (CV=27%) in the northern Gulf of Mexico based on surveys in 2003 and 2004 (Waring <em>et al. </em>2009). Aerial surveys on the European continental shelf in summer 2016 (SCANS-III) generated an estimate of 11,069 Risso’s Dolphins (CV=51%), with highest densities off eastern Ireland and northwestern Scotland (Hammond <em>et al. </em>2017).<br/><br/>In the northern Indian Ocean, Ballance and Pitman (1998) recorded Risso’s Dolphin as the fourth most abundant cetacean species, in Tanzania in the western Indian Ocean it was the second most frequently encountered species after the Spinner Dolphin (<em>Stenella longirostris</em>) (Braulik <em>et al</em>. 2018). It is one of the most common species in the Red Sea (Notarbartolo di Sciara <em>et al</em>. 2017). Estimates based on indices of relative abundance of Risso’s Dolphins off Sri Lanka from 1980 to 1984 ranged from 5,500 to 13,000 animals (Kruse <em style=""font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 9pt;"">et al</em>. 1991). Recent surveys suggest a possible decline of Risso’s Dolphins off Sri Lanka, particularly along the south coast (Anderson 2013). In the eastern Sulu Sea in 1994-1995, Dolar <em style=""font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 9pt;"">et al</em>. (2006) estimated abundance at 1,514 (CV=55%). There were estimated to be 83,300 (CV=17%) Risso’s Dolphins in three areas of concentrated occurrence off Japan between 1983 and 1991 (Miyashita 1993). Extensive aerial surveys conducted in the southwestern Indian Ocean in 2009 and 2010 produced abundance estimates for the Seychelles (17,115 individuals, CV=28%), the Mascarene islands (554, CV=86%), and the northern (298, CV=74%), central (3,107, CV=33%), and southern (3,141, CV=33%) Mozambique Channel (Laran <em>et al. </em>2017). The sum of the above abundance estimates is around 350,000, however, as these surveys covered only a small proportion of the total range of the species, total range-wide abundance is likely to be substantially higher.<br/><br/>There is no information on global trends in abundance. However, decreases may have occurred in the northern Gulf of Mexico (Mullin and Fulling 2004, Waring <em>et al.</em> 2009) and along the west coast of the U.S. (Carretta <em>et al.</em> 2009). In the late 1950s, Risso's Dolphins were rarely encountered in the Southern California Bight, and between 1975 and 1978 they were still considered to be a minor part of the cetacean fauna, representing only 3% of the cetaceans observed (Kruse <em>et al</em>. 1999). After the El Niño event of 1982/83, however, numbers of Risso's Dolphins increased, especially around Santa Catalina Island where they came to be considered common (Shane 1995). In Sri Lanka, tuna drift gillnet fisheries may have caused a dramatic decline of Risso’s Dolphins (Kruse <em>et al.</em> 1991). The species is currently very rare there, while it was reported as abundant in the 1980s (Leatherwood and Reeves 1989, Anderson 2013).</p>",Unknown,"The Risso’s Dolphin&#160;is a widely distributed species that primarily inhabits waters of the continental slope and outer shelf (especially areas with steep bottom topography) in the tropics and temperate regions of both hemispheres (Baumgartner 1997, Kruse <em>et al</em>. 1999, Jefferson <em>et al. </em>2014). It also occurs in oceanic areas (beyond the 2,000 m depth contour) such as in the eastern tropical Pacific, in the northeastern Atlantic (Hammond <em>et al. </em>2017), in the western Indian Ocean and in the northwestern Pacific (Jefferson <em>et al. </em>2014). In the north of its range, Risso’s Dolphins have also been recorded from Newfoundland, Norway, the Kamchatka Peninsula, and the Gulf of Alaska. In the south, they have been recorded off the tip of South Africa, southern Australia, the North Island of New Zealand and to 40-50°S off both coasts of South America (Jefferson <em>et al.</em> 2014). Their range includes many semi-enclosed bodies of water, such as the Gulf of Mexico, Gulf of California, Red Sea, Gulf of Aden, Sea of Japan, and Mediterranean Sea. In a number of regions, Risso’s Dolphins can be encountered in the shallow waters of the continental shelf, such as in the English Channel (Kiszka <em>et al. </em>2004, 2007) and the Celtic Sea (Reid <em>et al. </em>2003). They are relatively rare along the Atlantic coast of South America (Jefferson <em>et al. </em>2014).","<p>This species is (or has been) hunted for food in some places around the world, including in the Caribbean, Japan, Indonesia, and Sri Lanka. </p>",Marine,"<p>The Risso’s Dolphin is listed in Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES).

50358334,11047,Kogia breviceps,Least Concern,,2020,2019-10-11 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<p>The Pygmy Sperm Whale is distributed in deep oceanic waters of the tropical and temperate Atlantic, Indian and Pacific Oceans, from approximately 50°S to 50-60°N. Despite the expansion of cetacean research in oceanic waters, there is still very limited information on the distribution, abundance, behaviour or population structure of Pygmy Sperm Whales globally. This is largely due to the short surfacing interval, cryptic surface behavior and long, deep dives which make these whales extremely challenging to observe at sea. There is no information on global abundance or trends but numerous stranding records and high detection rates during acoustic surveys indicate that this species is not as uncommon as visual surveys would suggest. Unlike some beaked whales, Pygmy Sperm Whales do not seem to experience significant impacts from exposure to anthropogenic noise, and they also do not appear to be bycaught frequently in fishing gear. However, because they are so rarely observed, declines would be difficult to detect and therefore a 30% global reduction over three generations (36 years; Taylor <em>et al</em>. 2007) cannot be ruled out.&#160; </p>  <p>The Pygmy Sperm Whale was classified as Data Deficient (DD) on the IUCN Red List in 2008 and it remains extremely data-poor. The Guidelines (Version 11, 2014) state that: “If the data are so uncertain that both CR and LC are plausible categories, the taxon can be listed as DD”. In this instance the number of sightings and strandings and the wide pan-tropical distribution preclude the species being classified as Critically Endangered and DD therefore cannot be applied. The Pygmy Sperm Whale is therefore classified as Least Concern on the assumption that it is widely distributed and there are areas of known concentration, no major threats are known to occur across the majority of its range and it is likely to be more common than would be suggested from sighting surveys (due to its cryptic behavior).</p>","<p>At-sea observations of Pygmy Sperm Whales are rare, and therefore their habitat preferences remain poorly understood. Nevertheless, it is established that they occur over continental and insular slope waters, as well as in deep oceanic waters. Off the main Hawaiian Islands, small-boat dedicated surveys conducted from 2000 to 2012 showed that Pygmy Sperm Whales occur mostly in waters deeper than 2000 m (Baird <em>et al</em>. 2013). Elsewhere, sightings are often aggregated with those of Dwarf Sperm Whales, which makes a detailed assessment of their habitat preferences challenging (e.g. Mullin <em>et al</em>. 2004). In the Gulf of Mexico, Baumgartner <em>et al</em>. (2001) recorded sightings most frequently in water depths between 400 and 1,000 m, with some sightings extending into much deeper waters (up to 3,500 m). </p>  <p>A number of studies have described the diet and feeding ecology of Pygmy Sperm Whales around the globe. Their diet consists primarily of oceanic cephalopods, but includes fish, shrimp and swimming crabs (Ross 1979, Beatson 2007, Spitz <em>et al</em>. 2011). Small mesopelagic squid (particularly Histiothidae and Cranchiidae) contribute significantly to the diet of Pygmy Sperm Whales (Beatson 2007, Spitz <em>et al</em>. 2011). Cephalopods are the primary prey of Pygmy Sperm Whales in Hawaiian waters judging by the fact that they comprised 78.7% of prey abundance and 93.4% of the biomass in stomachs of stranded specimens, with 38 species from 17 different families represented (West <em>et al</em>. 2009). Morphological adaptations such as their “false gills” and ability to squirt ink suggest that the evolution of <em>Kogia</em> spp. was shaped in part by high predation pressure, particularly from sharks and killer whales (Plön 2004). </p>","<p>Small numbers of Pygmy Sperm Whales have been taken in coastal whaling operations off Japan, Indonesia, Taiwan, the Lesser Antilles, and Sri Lanka (Jefferson <em>et al</em>. 1993). However, the extent of takes is extremely small. They have also been caught incidentally in drift gillnet fisheries in Sri Lanka, Thailand, California and in the north-east Atlantic (Jefferson <em>et al. </em>1993, Barlow <em>et al. </em>1997, Perez <em>et al. </em>2001). In 2005, a large series of unusual stranding events over about 3 weeks in and around Taiwan included several <em>Kogia</em>&#160;(Wang and Yang 2006, Yang <em>et al</em>. 2008), with at least two of them Pygmy Sperm Whales (Yang <em>et al</em>. 2008). It is unknown if military, seismic or other loud noise-producing human activities were implicated in these strandings. Pygmy sperm whales are known to have died from plastic ingestion (Tarpley &amp; Marwitz 1993). The neurotoxin domoic acid (DA) was detected in urine and fecal samples recovered from 24 of 41 Pygmy Sperm Whales stranded along the U.S. Atlantic coast from 1997 to 2008, suggesting that exposure to these toxins from harmful algal blooms should be a concern (Fire <em>et al</em>. 2009).</p>","<p>There are no estimates of global Pygmy Sperm Whale abundance. Estimates of local or regional abundance are few, particularly because of the cryptic nature of this species as well as the difficulty of distinguishing <em>K. breviceps</em> from <em>K. sima </em>at sea. Abundance estimation is challenging because these whales dive for long periods and are inconspicuous when they surface. Therefore, visual surveys have a very low probability of detection (at or well below approximately 35%) (Barlow 1999; Hodge <em>et al</em>. 2018). </p>  <p>In the Gulf of Mexico, the most recent abundance estimates for Pygmy and Dwarf Sperm Whales combined is 186 (CV=1.04) from a summer survey conducted in 2009 and covering the waters from the 200m isobath to the seaward extent of the US EEZ (Garrison 2016). Earlier estimates in the Gulf of Mexico that again combined both <em>Kogia</em> species were from 1991-1994 (547, CV=0.28), 1996-2001 (742, CV=0.29) and 2003-2004 (453, CV=1.04) generated from surveys all conducted between April and August (Mullin and Fulling 2004, Mullin 2007). In the western North Atlantic, the best abundance estimate is 3,785 individuals (CV=0.47) from a summer survey conducted in 2011 from the waters of central Florida to the lower Bay of Fundy (Palka 2012, Garrison 2016). The two&#160;<em>Kogia</em>&#160;species strand frequently on beaches of the southeastern United States. For example, between 1978 and 1987, Odell (1991) documented that <em>Kogia</em> spp. was the second most frequently stranded cetacean taxon, after the common bottlenose dolphin (<em>Tursiops truncatus</em>), from North Carolina to Texas. From 2007–2015, 17 strandings of <em>Kogia</em> spp. were documented in Virginia, 81 in North Carolina, and 112 on the Atlantic coast of Florida (Hodge <em>et al</em>. 2018). The large number of strandings in these states suggests that <em>Kogia</em>&#160;spp. are a common component of the US Atlantic cetacean fauna, despite the fact that these species are seldom detected during visual surveys in these waters (Garrison <em>et al</em>. 2010). This was confirmed by a recent study that compared the detections of <em>Kogia</em>&#160;spp. between visual survey and passive acoustic methods along the U.S. Atlantic coast, concluding that <em>Kogia</em>&#160;spp. are indeed relatively common in shelf break and slope waters of the western North Atlantic between Virginia and Florida, and that they are not readily available to visual surveys in this region (Hodge <em>et al</em>. 2018).</p>  <p>The latest abundance estimate from the Hawaiian EEZ is 7,138 (CV=1.12) from a 2002 shipboard survey (Barlow 2006). A 2010 survey throughout the Hawaiian EEZ did not result in any <em>Kogia</em>&#160;spp. sightings (Bradford <em>et al. </em>2013). In Hawaiian waters, the Pygmy Sperm Whale is the second most frequently recorded stranded cetacean species, with 35 strandings documented between 1963 and 2008 (Shallenberger 1981, Nitta 1987, Maldini<em> et al</em>. 2005) again suggesting they are relatively common but rarely sighted in the region. Off the west coast of the US (Washington, Oregon and California), the best estimate of Pygmy Sperm Whale abundance is 4,111 (CV=1.12) based on shipboard line-transect surveys in 2008 and 2014 (Barlow 2016). In the southwestern Indian Ocean, aerial survey data resulted in an abundance of 683 (both species of <em>Kogia</em> aggregated) in the Mozambique Channel, the Seychelles and the Mascarene Islands (Laran <em>et al</em>. 2017). Florida (USA) and South Africa have the highest reported stranding rates of these species in the world, which suggests that <em>Kogia </em>spp. are relatively abundant in these regions (Credle 1988, Plön 2004).</p>  <p>Population genetic analyses conducted on southern hemisphere samples revealed a high haplotype and nucleotide diversity, but a lack of phylogeographic structure which indicates a high degree of gene flow among populations (Plön 2004).</p>  <p>The sum of the existing abundance estimates from various regions is over 10,000 individuals but surveys have covered only a small fraction of the entire habitat of the species and abundance estimates. Also, the estimates are often imprecise and negatively biased. Total global abundance is likely much higher than 10,000.</p>",Unknown,"<p>Pygmy Sperm Whales occur in deep oceanic waters of the temperate and tropical Atlantic, Indian and Pacific Oceans, from approximately 50°S to 50-60°N. The southern distribution includes New Zealand, Tasmania and South Africa, and the northern distributional limits extend to Canada, the United Kingdom and Japan. They are mostly observed over shelf breaks and in insular slope waters (Jefferson <em>et al. </em>2015, McAlpine 2018). Pygmy Sperm Whales are rarely recorded in the Mediterranean Sea, the Persian Gulf, the Red Sea or shallower waters of SE Asia (McAlpine 2018, Notarbartolo di Sciara <em>et al</em>. 2017). The range of <em>Kogia breviceps</em> is still poorly understood, though a lack of live sighting records may be due more to their inconspicuous behaviour than to rarity. Stranding records suggest that the species is locally common in some areas such as off South Africa or the southeastern USA (Plön 2004, Hodge <em>et al</em>. 2018). The Pygmy Sperm Whale has not been recorded in West Africa, but this may be due to the lack of surveys in that region (Weir 2010).</p>","<p>Pygmy Sperm Whales are hunted on a small scale in a few places (Jefferson <em>et al. </em>1993, 2015).</p>",Marine,<p>The species is listed in Appendix II of CITES.

Off the main Hawaiian Islands, the Dwarf Sperm Whale is the sixth most commonly observed species and it is most frequently sighted in waters 500-1,000m deep (Baird <em>et al</em>. 2013). Around Great Abaco in the Bahamas, Dwarf Sperm Whales are common in slope and deep oceanic waters, with some seasonal movement between the two (Dunphy-Daly <em>et al</em>. 2008). Elsewhere, sightings of Dwarf Sperm Whales are often combined with those of Pygmy Sperm Whales, which makes a detailed assessment of their respective habitat preferences challenging (Mullin <em>et al</em>. 2004). Relatively few studies have described the diet of Dwarf Sperm Whales. However, the available information suggests that they are primarily teuthophagous. Along the US Atlantic coast, Dwarf Sperm Whales primarily consume small squids of the families Histioteuthidae, Cranchiidae and Ommastrephidae (mean mantle length = 7.8 cm; Staudinger <em>et al</em>. 2014). In the SW Atlantic Ocean, stomach content data from Brazil suggest that at least 10 families of cephalopods are consumed (Dos Santos and Haimovici 2001, Moura <em>et al</em>. 2016). &#160;About 38 different prey species are known from South Africa (Ross 1979; Plön 2004).</p><br/><p></p>","<p></p><p>Small numbers of Dwarf Sperm Whales have been taken deliberately in opportunistic hunting off Japan, Indonesia, Taiwan, the Lesser Antilles, and Sri Lanka (Jefferson <em>et al</em>. 1993).

In the western North Atlantic, the most recent abundance estimate is 1,042 Dwarf Sperm Whales (CV=0.65) from a combination of vessel and aerial surveys conducted in July–August 2011 in offshore waters from North Carolina to the lower Bay of Fundy (Palka 2012). <em>Kogia</em> spp. strand frequently on beaches of the south-eastern United States.

In the southwestern Indian Ocean, aerial survey data corrected for availability bias resulted in an abundance estimate of 683 (both species of <em>Kogia</em> combined) in the Mozambique Channel, the Seychelles and the Mascarene Islands (Laran <em>et al</em>. 2017). Florida (USA) and South Africa have the highest reported stranding rates in the world of both Pygmy and Dwarf Sperm Whales, which suggests that <em>Kogia </em>spp. are relatively common in these regions (Credle 1988, Plön 2004).</p><br/><p></p>",Unknown,"<p></p><p>Although the range of Dwarf Sperm Whales is poorly understood, they occur in oceanic waters of the warm temperate and tropical Atlantic, Indian and Pacific Oceans, from approximately 45°S to 45°N. The paucity of live sighting records is due at least partly to their inconspicuous behaviour rather than rarity. Dwarf Sperm Whales seem to be more abundant in tropical and subtropical waters. They occur in slightly warmer waters than Pygmy Sperm Whales (<em>Kogia breviceps </em>Jefferson <em>et al. </em>2015, McAlpine 2018). There is only one record of a Dwarf Sperm Whale in the Mediterranean Sea, which is considered extralimital. The northern-most record is from the Faroe Islands (Bloch and Mikkelsen 2009) and the presumed southern range limits include South Africa (Plön 2004) and Southern Australia (Jefferson <em>et al.</em>&#160;2018). These whales are not known to migrate, but strandings in some regions are seasonal, which might indicate seasonal shifts in distribution. For example, in the north-eastern Atlantic, strandings occur mainly in autumn and winter (MacAlpine 2018). Dwarf Sperm Whales are most often observed over shelf breaks and in insular slope waters (McAlpine 2018). They are observed relatively frequently around certain oceanic islands such as the main Hawai’ian Islands (Baird <em>et al. </em>2013), Great Abaco in the Bahamas (Dunphy-Daly <em>et al. </em>2008), and Indian Ocean islands such as Mayotte, in the Mozambique Channel, around the Seychelles and in Pemba Channel, Tanzania (Kiszka <em>et al. </em>2010, Laran <em>et al. </em>2017, Braulik <em>et al. </em>2018). </p><br/><p></p>",<p>Dwarf Sperm Whales are hunted on rare occasions at a small scale in a few places (Jefferson <em>et al. </em>2018).</p>,Marine,<p>The species is listed in Appendix II of CITES.

The sum of current abundance estimates is several hundred thousand, but as abundance has not been estimated for large parts of the species range actual abundance is likely to be substantially higher. Although bycatch in high-seas drift gillnet fisheries during the 1970s and 1980s may have caused population declines, these fisheries have been banned since 1993. Current takes from bycatch and direct hunts appear to be small relative to reported global population size. The power to detect declines for this species is low because abundance estimates are imprecise, but in the main region where data are available (California) a decline in abundance of 22% in 10 years was reported (Campbell <em>et al</em>. 2015). This decline was attributed to changing ecosystem and oceanic conditions (Campbell <em>et al.</em> 2015). There is evidence for a significant decrease in herring spawning stock biomass in California waters since the 1980s (Schweigart <em>et al</em>. 2010) and it has been suggested that adult survival of Pacific White-sided Dolphins in British Columbia is strongly linked to inter-annual variability in herring abundance (Ashe 2015). </p>  The Pacific White-sided Dolphin was listed on the IUCN Red List as Least Concern in 2008. The large decline in abundance observed off California is of concern, but at present there is no evidence that this affects the&#160;species&#160;in&#160;a significant part of its range. Given the moderately high abundance and wide distribution in the North Pacific, the apparent lack of&#160;pervasive&#160;threats, and relatively low documented levels of bycatch in fishing gear, this species is again listed as Least Concern.","<p>Pacific White-sided Dolphins inhabit temperate oceanic waters across the North Pacific, as well as shelf and slope waters of the North Pacific continental margins (see distribution plots in Carretta <em>et al</em>. 2006 and Best <em>et al.</em> 2015), and in some inland waterways in British Columbia (Heise 1997a, Morton 2000, Ashe 2015) and southeast Alaska (Dahlheim <em>et al.</em> 2009).</p><p>Pacific White-sided Dolphins feed on a wide variety of small pelagic schooling fishes (e.g. lanternfish, anchovies, saury, horse mackerel, herring, and hake) as well as salmon and cephalopods (Heise 1997b, Morton 2000). They commonly occur in association with other marine mammal species, particularly Northern Right Whale Dolphins (<em>Lissodelphis borealis</em>), Risso's Dolphins (<em>Grampus griseus</em>), and California Sea Lions (<em>Zalophus californianus</em>) (Brownell <em>et al</em>. 1999).</p>","<p>Historically, the greatest threats to Pacific White-sided Dolphins were the high-seas drift gillnet fisheries for salmon and squid, which operated throughout the central and western North Pacific between about 35˚N and 47˚N (Hobbs and Jones 1993). Effort in those fisheries increased during the 1970s and peaked during the 1980s before a United Nations moratorium went into effect in January 1993. Bycatch estimates are available for only a subset of the total fishing effort at that time. The Japanese squid driftnet fishery killed an estimated 6,100 animals during 1989, and all five high-seas squid driftnet fisheries combined killed an estimated 5,759 during 1990 (Hobbs and Jones 1993). During the 1970s and 1980s, the high-seas driftnet fisheries combined likely killed on the order of 100,000 Pacific White-sided Dolphins. Although there is great uncertainty in the total population size, these bycatch levels may have caused some, but likely not substantial, population depletion (Hobbs and Jones 1993).</p><p>Smaller catches (e.g., at least 194 in 1987) are reported from the Japanese land-based salmon drift net fishery, and small numbers are taken yearly in seines, set nets, and trap nets around Japan (Brownell <em>et al</em>. 1999). Pacific White-sided Dolphins have never been the primary targets of Japanese drive fisheries, but they were harpooned in Japanese waters during the 1940s, and culling programs killed at least 466 Pacific White-sided Dolphins in Japanese waters between 1976 and 1980.</p><p>In the eastern Pacific, a total of 424 Pacific White-sided Dolphins were estimated killed in the U.S. West Coast shark and swordfish driftnet fishery between 1988 and 2002 (Perkins <em>et al</em>. 1994, Julian and Beeson 1998, Carretta <em>et al</em>. 2005). Additional low levels of mortality have been documented for bottom-set gillnets in California coastal waters, for drift gill nets in California and Alaska, and for trawl fisheries in Alaska; however, no overall mortality estimates are available for those fisheries. It is estimated that about one Pacific White-sided Dolphin per year is killed in the California drift gillnet fishery (Carretta <em>et al.</em> 2017). In the eastern Pacific, 28 Pacific White-sided dolphins were recorded as killed in scientific trawls off California between 2011-2015 (Carretta <em>et al</em>. 2016, 2017). The sustainable limit to mortality for this population were estimated at 191 individuals per year (Carretta <em>et al.</em> 2017) using the Potential Biological Removal calculation (Wade 1998). An estimated four individuals were killed due to vessel strikes from 2010 to 2014 (Carretta <em>et al.</em> 2016). None of these sources of mortality appears to be of a sufficient magnitude to have caused a population decline in the eastern North Pacific.</p><p>Mortality of Pacific White-sided Dolphins in salmon gillnet fisheries in British Columbia is thought to be below the sustainable limit, but not all fisheries are monitored, observer coverage is sparse in monitored fisheries, and species misidentification introduces uncertainty when estimating anthropogenic mortality for this species (Hall <em>et al</em>. 2002, Williams <em>et al</em>. 2008). In inshore waters of British Columbia, photo-identification photographs collected from 2008 to 2013 were examined for fishery-related injuries and about 0.5% of individual Pacific White-sided Dolphins were found to have injuries consistent with fishery interactions (Ashe 2015).</p>  <p>Blubber samples from five stranded Pacific White-sided Dolphins off Japan were found to have high (690 ng/g lipid weight) concentrations of polybrominated diphenyl ether when compared to other small cetaceans sampled in the region (Kajiwara <em>et al.</em> 2006). </p>  A decline in the presence of Pacific White-sided Dolphins in the southwestern Gulf of California from 1989 to 2009 is thought to be associated with warming SST in the region, suggesting that Pacific White-sided Dolphins are particularly vulnerable to climate change (Salvadeo <em>et al</em>. 2010). However, more research in needed to determine whether this shift in distribution is permanent.","<p>Pacific White-sided Dolphins are among the most abundant pelagic dolphins in the cold-temperate North Pacific; they are common both on the high seas and along continental margins (Brownell <em>et al</em>. 1999, Black 2018). Two separate estimates of abundance have been made for the central North Pacific, suggesting that 900,000–1,000,000 Pacific White-sided Dolphins inhabit this oceanic region (Buckland <em>et al</em>. 1993, Miyashita 1993). The estimate reported in Buckland <em>et al</em>. relies on data collected between 1987 and 1990 and thus is now outdated (&gt; 25 years old), plus precision was low for both studies, and vessel attraction probably resulted in a substantial overestimate of population size (Buckland <em>et al</em>. 1993).</p><p>There is genetic evidence supporting separate subpopulations in the southern portions of the species range, off the west coast of North America (Lux <em>et al</em>. 1997, Soldevilla <em>et al.</em> 2008) and in Japan (Hayano <em>et al</em>. 2004). There is also evidence for further genetic subdivision as follows: 1) Baja California, Mexico; 2) California, Oregon, and Washington; 3) an ‘offshore’ stratum on the international high seas; and 4) the west coast of Canada and southeast Alaska (Lux <em>et al</em>. 1997).</p><p>In the eastern North Pacific, the distribution of this species has been documented to vary dramatically with ocean conditions (Heise 1997a, Forney and Barlow 1998, Henderson <em>et al.</em> 2014). Abundance in waters off California, Oregon, and Washington was 23,817 (coefficient of variation (CV)=0.36) for pooled estimates from summer and fall months between 1991 and 2005 (Forney <em>et al.</em> 1995, Barlow and Forney 2007). The most recent abundance estimate (geometric mean of estimates) from this region, based on surveys in 2008 and 2014, was 26,814 (CV=0.28) (Barlow 2016, Carretta <em>et al.</em> 2017).&#160;</p><p>Information on trends in abundance is available for one part of the species’ range. Line-transect surveys conducted year-round as part of the California Cooperative Oceanic Fisheries Investigation off southern California estimated an average of 12,371 (CV=0.27) Pacific White-sided Dolphins in the survey region over the period July 2004–November 2013 (Campbell <em>et al.</em> 2015). Comparison of annual density estimates from 2004 to 2013, after accounting for seasonal differences, demonstrated a mean annual population change of -22.5% (95% confidence interval -35% to -9%), a statistically significant decline in the study area over the 10-year period (Campbell <em>et al.</em> 2015). Average density was estimated at 51.98/1000 km<sup>2</sup> (CV=0.27) and decreased from a peak of 93/1000 km<sup>2</sup> (CV=0.56) in 2005 to a low of 4.6/1000 km<sup>2</sup> (CV=07) in 2012. Pacific White-sided Dolphins were the third most frequently encountered species in the study area, but the only one of six cetacean species for which abundance was estimated that showed evidence of population decline (Campbell <em>et al.</em> 2015). The authors concluded that the long-term, significant decreasing trend observed for this species over the last decade does not appear to be driven only by sea surface temperature (SST), but by a suite of variables including but not limited to SST.</p><p>Abundance on continental shelf waters of the Canadian Pacific region was estimated to be about 25,900 (CV=0.35) in surveys in summer 2004 and 2005 (Williams and Thomas 2007). Additional years of survey effort in the same study area did not provide any evidence for a trend between 2004 and 2008, but the precision of the estimates was low (Best <em>et al.</em> 2015). Estimates of abundance for Pacific White-sided Dolphins from photo-identification studies in coastal waters off northeastern Vancouver Island, British Columbia were highly variable between 1990 and 2013, and ranged from about 985 (CV=0.55) to 2005 (CV=0.31) individuals (Ashe 2015).</p>",Unknown,"<p>Pacific White-sided Dolphins inhabit temperate waters of the North Pacific and some adjacent seas including the Sea of Japan, southern Okhotsk Sea, southern Bering Sea, and southern Gulf of California (Brownell <em>et al</em>. 1999, Black 2018). Their range includes continental slope waters of the western North Pacific as far south as southern China and Taiwan, shelf and slope waters of the eastern North Pacific from the Gulf of Alaska southward to Baja California, Mexico, and deep offshore waters of the North Pacific between about 35˚N and 47˚N latitude (Hobbs and Jones 1993, Black 2018). Pacific White-sided Dolphins generally inhabit productive continental shelf and slope waters within 185 km of shore (Black 2018).&#160;</p>  <p>Distribution appears to change seasonally in many places, probably linked to changes in water temperature and distribution of prey. The probability of sighting Pacific White-sided Dolphins in southeast Alaska appears to increase in spring (Dahlheim <em>et al</em>. 2009). Along the continental shelf of British Columbia (BC), Canada, Pacific White-sided Dolphin abundance showed no major seasonal differences in density among spring, summer, or fall surveys (Best <em>et al</em>. 2015). On a finer spatial scale, Morton (2000) reported an increase in sighting probability of this species in the fjords of BC in spring and fall.&#160;</p>  <p>Similarly, Pacific White-sided Dolphin sightings off southern California peaked during cooler water temperatures of spring (Henderson <em>et al.</em> 2014), which is likely to be due in part to the strong correlation of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation with fluctuations in the occurrence of small pelagic fish (Lehodey <em>et al.</em> 2006).&#160;</p>  Pacific White-sided Dolphin distribution is strongly associated with fluctuations in prey and water temperature in waters off Japan near Hokkaido (Iwahara <em>et al.</em> 2017).",This species is no longer the target of direct harvesting effort.,Marine,"<p>The Pacific White-sided Dolphin is listed in Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species.</p><p>The most significant international conservation measure for this species was the United Nations moratorium on high-seas driftnet fishing implemented in 1993.

The available population estimates are fairly imprecise, and many are several decades old, but they still suggest that abundance is in the low to mid hundreds of thousands. High levels of bycatch in driftnet fisheries during the 1970s and 1980s are estimated to have reduced the overall population size within the last three generations by an unknown amount. Estimates of decline ranged from 25-75% of total population size, but the most realistic scenarios suggest the decline was 30% or less. The primary threat to this species (high-seas driftnet fishing), which caused the population decline, has largely been eliminated since the UN moratorium that took effect at the end of 1992. The Northern Right Whale Dolphin was listed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List in 2008. Despite substantial incidental mortality in fisheries in the 1970s and 1980s, the species remains widespread and relatively abundant in the North Pacific, and in the absence of evidence that any current threats are causing significant mortality or population declines, the Northern Right Whale Dolphin is again assessed as Least Concern.</p>","The habitat of this species includes oceanic waters from the outer continental shelf to deep ocean basins across the cool, temperate North Pacific Ocean. Northern Right Whale Dolphins are sometimes seen near shore, especially where deep water approaches the coast (such as underwater canyons), and apparently prefer ""coastal-type"" waters in the California Current system (Jefferson <em>et al</em>. 1994). Off the coast of California, the distribution was documented to vary seasonally, shifting south during the summer months in response to changes in sea surface temperature (Forney and Barlow 1998). Ferrero (1998) observed in the central North Pacific that sea surface temperature was the most influential habitat parameter, with Northern Right Whale Dolphins occupying warmer waters than either Dall’s Porpoise (<em>Phocoenoides dalli)</em> or the Pacific White-sided Dolphin (<em>Lagenorhynchus obliquidens)</em>. <br/> <br/> Groups of Northern Right Whale Dolphins frequently mix with other marine mammals, especially Pacific White-sided Dolphins (with which they share a nearly identical range) and Risso’s Dolphins (<em>Grampus griseus</em>) (Baird and Stacey 1991, Lipsky and Brownell 2018). <br/> <br/> Although squid and lanternfish are the major prey items for Northern Right Whale Dolphins off southern California, a wide variety of other species are taken throughout their range (Leatherwood and Walker 1979, Jefferson <em>et al.</em> 1994). These include various species of cephalopods, hakes, and sauries (Lipsky and Brownell 2018).","<p>The UN moratorium on large-scale high-seas driftnets that came into effect in 1992 reduced the incidental take of&#160;Northern Right Whale Dolphins&#160;to a considerable extent (see Population section for estimated numbers taken), but the continued use of driftnets to catch billfish, sharks, squid, and tuna inside the Exclusive Economic Zones of North Pacific countries, and some continued illegal fishing on the high seas, results in the killing of unknown numbers of this species each year.</p>  Mortality and serious injury of Northern Right Whale Dolphins in the California driftnet fishery for the five most recent years of monitoring, 2010-2014, was 17.6 (CV=0.36) individuals, or an average of 3.5 per year (Carretta <em>et al.</em> 2017a, b) which is well below the Potential Biological Removal level of 179 per year. From 1996 to 2002, Northern Right Whale Dolphins were the third most-frequently taken species in the California driftnet fishery for Broadbill Swordfish (<em>Xiphias gladius</em>) and Common Thresher Shark (<em>Alopias vulpinus</em>), with annual mortality estimated at 151 individuals (CV=25%) (Carretta <em>et al.</em> 2005). A short-lived Canadian experimental driftnet fishery for flying squid killed a total of 13 Right Whale Dolphins in 1986 and 1987 (Jefferson <em>et al</em>. 1994). Incidental catches have also occurred in Japanese and Russian purse seines and, as mentioned above, in Japanese salmon and squid driftnets (Jefferson <em>et al</em>. 1994).<br/> <br/> Northern Right Whale Dolphins have never been subject to extensive directed hunting, although they are sometimes taken in the hunt for small cetaceans in coastal Japan (e.g., 465 were reportedly killed in the harpoon fishery in 1949 (Kasuya 2017).","<p>The Northern Right Whale Dolphin is believed to be one of the most abundant oceanic dolphins in the North Pacific (Baird and Stacey 1991). Buckland <em>et al</em>. (1993) estimated that there were 68,000 (coefficient of variation (CV)=71%) Northern Right Whale Dolphins, while Miyashita (1991, 1993) estimated 247,000 (95% confidence interval (CI): 61,000-1,004,000). By contrast, Hiramatsu (1993) estimated 535,000 (CI: 394,000-738,000) dolphins for the same region based on modelling of bycatch data. All estimates have high uncertainty and are now close to 30 years old. </p>  <p>The average estimated abundance of Northern Right Whale Dolphins off the U.S. west coast during surveys conducted from 1991 to 2005 was about 11,100 (CV=26%) (Barlow and Forney 2007). The most recent abundance estimate for the stock in U.S waters of California, Oregon, and Washington, was 26,556 (CV=44%) based on the geometric mean of estimates from summer/autumn vessel-based line-transect surveys between 2008 and 2014 (Carretta <em>et al</em>. 2017a, Barlow 2016). This estimate includes adjustments (“correction factors”) for animals missed during the surveys.</p>  <p>Northern Right Whale Dolphins experienced very high levels of fishery-induced mortality in large-scale, high-seas squid driftnet fisheries that were conducted from about 38°N to 46°N and 171°E to 151°W. Assessing the population-level impacts of this mortality is complicated by the possible existence of coastal population(s) off California, Oregon, Washington, and British Columbia that are separate from the offshore populations that were subject to high levels of bycatch (Dizon <em>et al</em>. 1994). In addition, the abundance estimates that were available at the time were variable and imprecise. Total numbers killed by the North Pacific squid driftnet fleets of Japan, Taiwan, and South Korea in the late 1980s were estimated at about 15,000–24,000 per year, and this mortality is considered to have depleted the oceanic population(s) by an unknown amount. Kasuya (2017) reported that 7,909 and 9,320 Northern Right Whale Dolphins were killed in the Japanese high-seas squid and salmon driftnet fisheries in 1990 and 1991, respectively.</p>  <p>Using a variety of assumptions about population estimates, growth rates, and bycatch levels, Mangel (1993) presented analyses suggesting that declines of less than 30% were most likely, although more severe declines of up to 45–75% could not be ruled out under certain scenarios, including some biologically unrealistic ones.</p>  Considering the available data it is very likely that the total population of Northern Right Whale Dolphins is in the hundreds of thousands.<p></p>",Unknown,"The Northern Right Whale Dolphin is found in deep temperate and subarctic waters of the North Pacific Ocean, between about 30°N and 50°N (Jefferson <em>et al.</em> 2015).

Humpback Whales caught in the northern North Pacific in the 1950s were feeding mainly on euphausiids and fish (Nemoto 1959). In areas of Alaska and the North Atlantic, Humpback Whales have also been observed feeding in coordinated fashion on schools of Pacific Herring (<em>Clupea harengus</em>), Sand Lance (<em>Ammodytes</em> spp.), and (more rarely) Mackerel (<em>Scomber scombrus</em>), herding the school together with bubble nets, clouds or curtains (Hain <em>et al</em>. 1982).<br/> <br/> The timing of acquisition of tooth rake marks attributable to Killer Whales (<em>Orcinus orca</em>) indicates that Humpback Whale calves, but usually not subadults and adults, are subject to predation (Mehta <em>et al</em>. 2005).</p>  <p></p>  <p></p>","<p>Although modern commercial whaling seriously depleted all Humpback populations, some of which had already been reduced by pre-modern whaling, the species has demonstrated remarkable resilience, and there have been substantial increases in the North Atlantic, North Pacific, and Southern Hemisphere.

It is unclear whether there has been any recovery in the small, isolated population in the Arabian Sea.<br/><br/>Today, small numbers only are taken for local consumption in Greenland (up to 10 annually) and the island of Bequia (St. Vincent and the Grenadines) (up to four annually), with occasional takes elsewhere (IWC 2018b).<br/><br/>Humpback Whales, along with North Atlanatic Right Whales (<em>Eubalaena</em> <em>glacialis</em>), seem to be the most vulnerable of the large whales to becoming accidentally entangled, often fatally, in fishing gear and sometimes other debris. They are also vulnerable to injury by ship strikes, which can also be fatal. In most areas, the majority of entanglements (Robbins <em>et al</em>. 2009), and also the majority of ship strikes, are likely to go undetected, but there is no generally accepted method for extrapolating from the observed events to estimate totals.<br/><br/>State members of the IWC are encouraged to report bycatches and ship strikes annually to the IWC, but few do so.

(2016) found that most Humpback Whales spent only brief periods in Scottish waters, but that the entanglement rate per day of whale presence was such that it would be unsustainable for a population that fed regularly in Scottish waters.<br/><br/>The distribution of Humpbacks in the Arabian Sea overlaps that of fisheries known to be dangerous to Humpbacks, and 30-40% of the photographed whales showed entanglement-related scars (Minton <em>et al</em>. 2011).</p><p></p>","<p></p><p><em><strong>North Atlantic</strong></em><br/>The last comprehensive assessment of North Atlantic Humpback Whales was completed by the IWC Scientific Committee in 2002 (IWC 2003), but more recent data are available for some areas. The abundance estimate for the West Indies group of breeding aggregations, obtained from photographic capture-recapture, was 10,752 whales in 1992-93 (coefficient of variation (CV) 0.07) with an estimated annual rate of increase of 3.1% (standard error (SE) 0.5%) over the period 1979-93 (Stevick <em>et al</em>. 2003). The latest abundance estimate for part of the Cape Verde Island population is 260 during 2010-2013, also from&#160;photographic capture-recapture&#160;(Ryan<em> et al</em>. 2014).<br/><br/>The most recent estimates of abundance in the individual summer feeding grounds are: Gulf of Maine and Bay of Fundy - 823 in 2008 (Hayes <em>et al</em>. 2017); Canadian Atlantic (Newfoundland, Labrador, Gulf of Saint Lawrence, and Scotia Shelf) - 2,080 (CV 0.22) in 2007 (Lawson <em>and</em> Gosselin 2009); West Greenland - 993 (CV 0.46) in 2015 (Hansen <em>et al</em>. 2018); East Greenland coastal and central North Atlantic (Iceland, East Greenland, Faeroes, Jan Mayen) 10,031 (CV 0.36) in 2015 (Pike <em>et al</em>. 2018); northeastern Atlantic (British Isles, Norwegian Sea, Barents Sea) 1,450 (CV 0.29) in 2001 (Øien <em>et al</em>. 2009). These estimates total about 15,000 whales with a nominal CV of 0.25.<br/><br/>The abundance of Humpback Whales in the Gulf of Maine and northwestern Atlantic was estimated to be growing at 6.5% per year during 1979-91 (Barlow and Clapham 1997) but the rate of increase was less than 4% per year during 1992-2000 (Clapham <em>et al</em>. 2003). Abundance in the central North Atlantic (East Greenland, Iceland, Faeroe Islands) increased sharply from 1987 to 1995 but there has been no clear trend since then (Pike <em>et al</em>. 2018).<br/><br/>Humpback Whales were subject to significant removals by pre-modern whalers especially in their wintering grounds in the West Indies and Cape Verde Islands (Smith and Reeves 2003). Whaling in the West Indies (including Bermuda) is partially documented from 1664, but the main period was 1826-1928, during which about 8,600 whales were estimated to have been killed (Reeves <em>et al</em>. 2001). Whaling in the Cape Verde Islands occurred primarily during 1850-1912 with a total estimated kill of about 3,000 animals (Reeves <em>et al</em>. 2002).<br/><br/>Humpbacks were exploited by modern whalers in their summer feeding grounds from the 1860s, especially off Iceland and Norway (Jonsgård 1977<em>,</em> Allison 2017). About 3,200 Humpback Whales were recorded taken by early modern whaling during 1880-1916, mainly off northern Norway and Iceland. Allowing for a substantial struck and lost rate in early modern whaling, and considering that about 20% of the recorded catch of whales was unspecified to species, the total kill in this period may have exceeded 5,000 Humpback Whales.<br/><br/>About 1,500 Humpback Whales are reported to have been killed in the North Atlantic since 1916, from a variety of areas including the British Isles, Faeroes, Norway, Iceland, Greenland, and eastern Canada, as well as Norwegian pelagic catches. Humpback Whales were protected from commercial whaling in the North Atlantic from the 1955 season by the IWC, except for small catches off Greenland (IWC 1954). However, catch levels had become very low by the 1920s, despite continued high catches of Fin Whales (<em>Balaenoptera physalus</em>). This suggests that the Humpback population was low at that time.<br/><br/>Attempts to estimate pre-whaling populations from catch, abundance and trend data have yielded inconclusive results (IWC 2003<em>,</em> Punt <em>et al</em>. 2006). However, the current population level is probably considerably higher than the 1942 level because only a small number of Humpbacks (377) were caught between 1942 and the start of the period (from 1979) over which an increase has been documented.<br/><br/>Using genetic methods, Roman and Palumbi (2004) estimated the pre-whaling population of&#160;Humpback Whales in the North Atlantic to be 240,000 (95% confidence interval (CI) 156,000-401,000). However, their method assumed that North Atlantic Humpback Whales form a single clade, which they do not (Jackson <em>et al</em>. 2014). Hence, the Roman and Palumbi estimate would be expected to reflect the global abundance of Humpback Whales prior to whaling rather than the North Atlantic population.<em><strong><br/><br/>North Pacific</strong></em><br/>The total abundance of Humpback Whales in the North Pacific was estimated by photographic capture-recapture at 21,063 (CV 0.04) during 2004-06 (Barlow <em>et al</em>. 2011). A comparable estimate from 1993-96 data, calculated retrospectively, was 9,500. The population appeared to have been increasing since 1980 at rates of 5-8% per year in each of the areas with sufficient data to estimate trend (Calambokidis and Barlow 2017). More recent data from the U.S. west coast suggest that numbers there have levelled off (Calambokidis <em>et al</em>. 2017). Using a different model for the relation between summering and wintering grounds applied to the same data as Barlow <em style=""font-family: Georgia, serif;"">et al</em>. (2011), Wade <em style=""font-family: Georgia, serif;"">et al</em>. (2016, revised by Wade 2017) estimated a total of 15,805 for the wintering grounds and 16,225 for the feeding grounds. It is not clear why Wade’s totals are lower than Barlow <em style=""font-family: Georgia, serif;"">et al</em>.’s, but all evidence indicates that the Hawaiian group is the largest of the wintering populations, comprising 10,000-12,000 whales and making up at least half of the total North Pacific population. Estimates for the other breeding populations are Mexican (2,000-5,000), Asian (1,000-2,000) and Central American (300-1,000); no estimate exists for the Western Pacific (Mariana Islands) area.<br/><br/>Independent of the above data, the abundance of Humpback Whales in the eastern North Pacific (170°E to 135°W) and the eastern Bering Sea has been estimated from the Pacific Ocean Whale and Environment (POWER) series of sightings surveys at 14,407 (CV 0.56) (Inai <em>et al</em>. 2018). However, Humpback Whales are also abundant west of these areas, in the western Bering Sea and near the western Aleutian Islands, eastern and western Kamchatka and the Kuril Islands (Miyashita <em>et al</em> 2006<em>,</em> Filatova <em>et al</em>. 2017<em>,</em> Gushcherov <em>et al</em>. 2018).<br/><br/>Humpback Whales were hunted in Japan at least since 1570 and catching probably increased with the development of net-assisted whaling from circa 1677 (Kasuya 2018). The number taken is very uncertain because detailed catch figures prior to the 20th century are available from only two of about a dozen locations where whaling occurred in southern Japan, on both the Sea of Japan and the Pacific coasts (Omura 1986).&#160;The proportion of whales killed but lost is also unclear: although quite high rates of escape were indicated, it is unclear how many of these would have been mortally wounded. A single whaling firm operating in Kyushu (southwestern Japan), among several known to have been active, took 21,790 whales between 1725 and 1874, of which the majority were likely Humpbacks judging from the species breakdown at neighbouring locations. The data suggest a decline towards the end of the 19th century, but not as marked as for North Pacific Right Whales (<em>Eubalaena japonica</em>).<br/><br/>Building on the works of Maury (1852) and Townsend (1935), Smith <em>et al</em>. (2012) plotted by month the positions of about 250 catches and a few sightings of Humpbacks in the North Pacific from a sample of logbooks of American sail whalers in the 19<sup>th</sup> century.&#160;Humpback Whales occurred in most of the summering and wintering areas known today, including the Sea of Japan and Okhotsk Sea. The logbooks are thought to comprise about 10% of all American voyages, but it is unclear how representative they are, especially of the earlier voyages. Furthermore, at least some European vessels were also active in the North Pacific.&#160;It is possible that a few thousand Humpback Whales were taken. Also in the 19<sup>th</sup> century, American shore-based whalers operating on the coast of California killed an estimated 2,000 Humpback Whales between 1854 and 1899 (Reeves <em>and</em> Smith 2010).<br/><br/>Modern whaling began in Japan in 1898 and catches by species are recorded since 1911. Humpback Whales made up only 2.0% (950 out of 47,343) of the catch of large whales in Japan (including the occupied Kuril Islands) during 1911-45, and only 0.2% (90 out of 48,010) of the catch of large whales in Japan during 1946-65 (Allison, 2017). Thus, the Asian migratory population was likely already depleted before the start of modern whaling, and already commercially extinct by the time the catching of Humpbacks in the North Pacific was prohibited by the IWC from 1966 (IWC 1965). Subgroups of the Asian wintering population that used more oceanic migratory corridors probably survived a bit longer, given that over 800 Humpbacks were taken in Ogasawara (Bonin Islands) between 1922-1945, nearly 800 in Okinawa (Ryukyu Islands) during 1958-62, and over 700 in Taiwan during 1920-39.<br/><br/>Approximately 18,000 Humpbacks are recorded as being taken by modern whaling along the American coasts during 1911-65 (5,000 in Alaska, 6,000 in British Columbia, 5,000 in California and Washington, and 2,000 off Baja California, Mexico) (Allison 2017). &#160;Modern pelagic whaling began in the 1930s and a total of over 8,000 Humpback Whales were taken, including 7,714 by fleets of the USSR, which illegally took 248 Humpback Whales after catches had been prohibited by the IWC (Ivashchenko <em>et al</em>. 2013).<br/><br/>Estimated catches of Humpback Whales in the North Pacific since 1942 total approximately 10,700 whales (Allison 2017). Given the evidence of an increase of over 10,000 whales between the 1980s and the early the 2000s, it is likely that the current population size in the North Pacific as a whole is above the 1942 level.<br/><br/>The Hawaiian wintering population is today the largest of the extant wintering populations. The 19<sup>th</sup> century records include relatively few catches or sightings of Humpbacks in this area, even though Hawaii was a major staging area for long-distance whalers in the Pacific. The thesis of Herman (1979) that Humpbacks were uncommon in Hawaii in the 19<sup>th</sup> century and earlier, based on the paucity of references to Humpbacks in contemporary accounts and local folklore, is controversial. However, it is plausible that Humpbacks were historically less abundant in Hawaii than they are today.<em><strong><br/><br/>Northern Indian Ocean</strong></em><br/>Population estimates derived from photo-identification conducted in the Arabian Sea during 2000-04 were all less than 100 animals (Minton <em>et al</em>. 2011). Provisional analysis of data collected during 2000-2015 yielded an abundance estimate of 89 whales (CV 0.26) in 2015, which may be negatively biased due to heterogeneity (Collins <em>et al</em>. 2018). The Soviet whaling fleet <em>Sovetskaya Ukraina</em> illegally took 238 Humpback Whales off the coasts of Oman, Pakistan, and northwestern India in November 1966 (Mikhalev 1997). The current population is very small and its current trend is not known. This population is listed separately as Endangered under Red List criterion D (Minton <em>et al</em>. 2008).<em><strong><br/><br/>Southern Hemisphere</strong></em><br/>Results of the IWC Scientific Committee’s multi-year “comprehensive assessment” of Southern Hemisphere Humpback Whales, completed in 2015, are summarized by IWC (2016). The estimated total population size in 2015 was 97,000 (CI 78,000-118,000),&#160;obtained from a mix of photographic and genetic capture-recapture, aerial surveys, and shore-based censuses. The estimated total population size in 1942, from a fitted population model, was about 60,000 (confidence interval not given) while the estimated “pre-whaling” population size in 1900 was 138,000 (CI 112,000-198,000). All breeding populations were estimated to have recovered to a substantial fraction of their pre-whaling abundance, except for the West South Africa (BSB2) population, which may still be quite depleted.<br/><br/>The IWC comprehensive assessment assumed that catches by pre-modern whalers were small enough, or long enough ago, to be ignored. However, de Morais <em>et al</em>. (2017) estimated catches of 11,000-33,000 Humpback Whales from pre-modern land whaling stations (armações) in Brazil during 1830-1924, and considered it likely that there had been similarly sizeable catches in the preceding century. From samples of logbooks of late 18<sup>th</sup> and 19<sup>th</sup> century sail whalers, Townsend (1935) and Smith <em>et al</em>. (2012) plotted positions for about 2,000 Humpback catches and sightings in the Southern Hemisphere. These show presence of Humpbacks in most of the wintering grounds known today, except for northeastern Australia, where the Great Barrier Reef probably made access too risky. The 19<sup>th</sup> century whalers did not follow their prey to their Antarctic summering grounds. No attempt has yet been made to estimate total removals from the logbook samples.<br/><br/>The recorded catches by 20<sup>th</sup> century whaling in the Southern Hemisphere total about 220,000, after allowing for some Humpbacks among the 5,000 unspecified whales taken in the early years (Allison 2017). Of the total, about 83,500 were taken by pelagic whaling fleets in the Antarctic and sub-Antarctic, which started in the early 20<sup>th</sup> century mainly south of 55°S; about 40,000 from land stations in the Antarctic and sub-Antarctic, mainly at South Georgia; about 29,000 along the west coast of southern Africa (Gabon, Angola, Namibia, and western South Africa); about 20,000 in the southwestern Indian Ocean (Madagascar, Mozambique, and Natal (South Africa); over 28,000 off western Australia; over 14,000 off eastern Australia and New Zealand; about 2,500 in the Southeast Pacific (Chile, Peru, and Ecuador); and about 2,000 off Brazil.<br/><br/>Attempts by the IWC to manage the hunting of Humpbacks in the Southern Hemisphere had limited effect. Takes of Humpbacks by pelagic fleets in the Southern Ocean (south of 40°S) were prohibited in the initial Schedule of the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling that was adopted in 1946 and came into force in 1948. This ban was relaxed from 1950 to allow an annual catch of 1,250 Humpbacks, but the numerical limit was often exceeded and was dropped from 1954 when Humpback catching was instead limited to four days in February. From 1959, increasingly restrictive area limits were imposed. The report of an IWC expert group in June 1963 inferred from the continuing steep decline in the Humpback population that substantial unreported catches had occurred (Chapman 1964). The IWC finally banned all catching of Humpbacks throughout the Southern Hemisphere from 1964 (IWC 1965). Subsequently, it emerged that Humpback catches by the USSR fleets had indeed exceeded the reported values by about 46,000 whales, and had continued until 1968, with small takes continuing until 1973 (Zemsky <em>et al</em>. 1996<em>,</em> Ivashchenko <em>et al</em>. 2011). Even before the 1964 Humpback ban, almost all of the additional Soviet catches had been illegal in at least one respect: they were either outside the permitted season, outside the permitted areas, below the minimum allowed body size, or of mothers with calves.<br/><br/>The IWC Scientific Committee’s recent comprehensive assessment, which took account of the previously unreported catches, showed that the current hemispheric population was, by now, very likely above its 1942 level. The assessment probably reflects the current population size and the trends over recent decades quite well, but both the estimates of pre-whaling population size, and the projections of future recovery, are probably more uncertain than the assessment results suggest, for the following reasons; firstly, as noted above, the pre-modern catches may not have been insignificant; secondly, simulation studies by Leaper <em>et al</em>. (2011) showed that alternative assumptions about density-dependent limitation can yield substantially different estimated population trajectories for both the past and the future; finally, Clapham and Zerbini (2015) cautioned that a key model assumption, that all historical breeding areas will be repopulated, may not hold when social factors are considered.<em><strong><br/><br/>Global Assessment</strong></em><br/>The mean age at first reproduction for Humpback Whales is estimated to be 10-12 years in the Southern Hemisphere (Best 2011) with a similar value in the North Pacific (Gabriele <em>et al</em>. 2007). Clapham (1992) reported a value of 5-7 years for Humpbacks in the Gulf of Maine, North Atlantic, but this increased to about 9 years for cohorts born in 1987 and later (Robbins 2007). Taylor <em>et al</em>. (2007) cited 6 years as a reasonable default value, based on Clapham (1992). Taking a compromise value of 10 years, the generation time of 21.5 years estimated by Taylor <em>et al</em>. (2007) would become 25.5 years. Hence the 3-generation time window for applying the reduction criterion (A1) for a threatened category is 1942-2018.<br/><br/>Using the proportion mature of 0.62 estimated by Taylor <em>et al</em>. (2007), the recent global population contains approximately 84,000 mature individuals out of a total of 135,000 whales. The population in 2018 is estimated to be above the 1942 level in each of the major ocean regions (North Atlantic, North Pacific, Southern Hemisphere). The small Arabian Sea population is probably below the 1942 level, because of the illegal catches taken in the 1960s.</p><p></p>",Increasing,"<p></p><p>The Humpback Whale is a cosmopolitan species found in all the major ocean basins, and all but one of the subpopulations (that of the Arabian Sea) migrate between mating and calving grounds in tropical waters, usually near continental coastlines or island groups and productive colder-water feeding areas in temperate and high latitudes (Dawbin 1966, Clapham and Mead 1999). There tends to be strong, maternally directed fidelity to feeding and breeding grounds, but with some interchange between grounds, especially of males but also of females (Baker <em>et al</em>. 2013, Rosenbaum <em>et al</em>. 2017). <br/><br/><em><strong>North Atlantic</strong></em><br/>Humpbacks in the North Atlantic range in summer from the Gulf of Maine in the west to the British Isles and Norway in the east. The northern extent of the Humpback's range includes the Barents Sea, Greenland Sea, and Davis Strait, but unlike Bowhead Whales (<em>Balaena mysticetus</em>), they do not enter the pack ice. A number of main feeding grounds have been identified: Gulf of Maine, Gulf of St. Lawrence, Newfoundland, west of Greenland, west of Iceland, northeast Iceland, Jan Mayen, northern Norway, Bear Island, and western Svalbard (Bettridge <em>et al</em>. 2015). Smaller numbers have been observed feeding in other areas such as the Hudson River Estuary (Brown <em>et al</em>. 2018). Humpback Whales are rare in the central and southern North Sea and there are very few records from the Baltic Sea. Humpback Whales were previously very rare in the Mediterranean Sea; there has been a notable increase in sightings since 1990, but they are still not common (Russo <em>et al</em>. 2016).<br/><br/>The main wintering grounds are in the West Indies and wider Caribbean region where they are found along the entire Antillean arc from Cuba to Venezuela (Hayes <em>et al</em>. 2017). The largest aggregations occur on Silver and Navidad Banks near the Dominican Republic, with much lower numbers in Samana Bay (Dominican Republic), off the northwestern coast of Puerto Rico, and around the Virgin Islands and the eastern Antilles. Smaller numbers winter around the Cape Verde Islands (Wenzel <em>et al</em>. 2009). There is some interchange of individuals between the eastern and western Atlantic wintering grounds (Stevick <em>et al</em>. 2016), and some whales may remain in colder, more northern waters throughout the winter (Clapham <em>et al</em>. 1993<em>,</em> Magnúsdóttir <em>et al</em>. 2014<em>,</em> Kowarski 2018).<br/><br/>While whales wintering in the Caribbean region have been matched photographically or genetically with whales in each of the summer feeding grounds, whales from the smaller Cape Verde Islands wintering group have to date been matched only with the northeastern feeding grounds. Individuals from the Cape Verdes have also been observed in spring in the Azores, where they appear to stop over to feed while on their way north (Wenzel <em>et al</em>. 2009<em>,</em> Visser <em>et al</em>. 2011). The genetic and photographic evidence suggests that some of the whales on the Icelandic and Norwegian feeding grounds migrate in winter to an unknown area other than the West Indies or the Cape Verde Islands (Smith and Pike 2009).<br/><br/>The Humpback Whales that occur in the austral winter north of the equator along the African coast from Gabon to Guinea are known or presumed to be Southern Hemisphere Humpback Whales (Bamy <em>et al</em>. 2010).<br/><br/><em><strong>North Pacific</strong></em><strong></strong><br/>In the North Pacific, the Humpback Whale’s summer range covers shelf waters from southern California to the Gulf of Alaska, Bering Sea, Chukchi Sea, the Aleutian chain and Kamchatka, Kuril Islands, and northeastern Japan (Calambokidis <em>et al</em>. 2008). Humpbacks were hunted in the Sea of Japan and the Okhotsk Sea and in the past (Kasuya 2018<em>,</em> Smith <em>et al</em>. 2012). They were for some time rare in the Okhotsk Sea (Miyashita <em>et al</em>. 1996), but recently have been seen in the eastern and northern Okhotsk Sea (Guschcherov <em>et al</em>. 2018<em>,</em> Myasnikov <em>et al</em>. 2016). Humpbacks are not common in the Sea of Japan but continue to be taken occasionally as bycatch in Korean waters. Recent occurrence in the Beaufort Sea may be linked to warming climate trends (Hashagen <em>et al</em>. 2009).<br/><br/>The wintering grounds identified to date include (from west to east) are: 1) Asian – Ogasawara (Bonin Islands), Okinawa (Ryukyu Islands), and northern Philippines; 2) west-central Pacific (presumed to be the area of the Mariana Islands, including Guam); 3). Hawaiian; 4) Mexican - Baja California, Gulf of California, Revillagigedo Archipelago, and Mexican mainland; and 5) Central American – Costa Rica, Panama and Colombia (IWC 2018a).<br/><br/>The least well-known wintering area is the west-central Pacific, because only a few whales have been observed there (Hill <em>et al</em>. 2017), but the existence of a substantial wintering ground had been inferred from the substantial proportion of Humpback Whales in the Aleutian Islands that could not be matched to other known wintering grounds (Calambokidis <em>et al</em>. 2008). It remains to be determined whether this is the Marianas region, which was a Humpback whaling ground in the 19<sup>th</sup> century (Townsend 1935).<br/><br/>The Central American wintering ground overlaps the winter range of Southern Hemisphere Humpback Whales, but there is probably not much temporal overlap because the Southern Humpback Whales occupy the area in the austral winter (Rasmussen <em>et al</em>. 2007).<br/><br/>Small numbers of Humpbacks have recently been seen at previously unknown winter locations such as Amami-Ohshima Island (28°N 129°E) and Hachijō-jima Island (33°N 140°E, about 300km south of Tokyo, Japan) (Kato <em>et al</em>. 2017).<br/><br/>The various wintering populations have different summer distributions but with considerable overlap. The whales wintering off Central America and mainland Mexico feed mainly off the coasts California, Oregon and Washington (USA), while whales from the Revillagigedo Islands feed mainly in the Gulf of Alaska (Urbán <em>et al</em>. 2017). Whales wintering off Hawaii are found in summer mainly in the Aleutians, the Gulf of Alaska (including Southeast Alaska) and the waters of British Columbia (Calambokidis <em>et al</em>. 2008). Most of the whales summering off Kamchatka migrate to the Asian wintering grounds, a lower number to the Hawaiian grounds, and a few to the Mexican grounds (Titova <em>et al</em>. 2018).<br/><br/>Movements between wintering grounds have also been documented (Calambokidis <em>et al</em>. 2008) but these appear to be sufficiently few that the wintering populations remain genetically differentiated, especially with respect to mtDNA, which reflects maternal lineages (Baker <em>et al</em>. 2013).<em><strong><br/><br/>Southern Hemisphere</strong></em><em></em><br/>The majority of Southern Hemisphere Humpback Whales migrate to the Antarctic in summer. They are abundant throughout the Antarctic in summer south to the ice edge, but not within the pack ice zone. There are also subantarctic summer feeding grounds around South Georgia (Dawbin 1966<em>,</em> Engel <em>and</em> Martin 2009) and the Fuegian archipelago (Acevedo <em>et al</em>. 2017). Some mothers with calves remain in mid-latitude waters in the Chilean fjords in the summer (Hucke-Gaete <em>et al</em>. 2013).<br/><br/>In the winter, Southern Hemisphere whales aggregate in specific nearshore breeding areas in the Atlantic, Indian and Pacific oceans, at least two of which extend north of the equator, i.e. off Colombia and Central America in the eastern Pacific and in the Bight of Benin (5°N, 2°E) in the eastern Atlantic. Some wintering grounds are fairly localized, for example around island groups, and some are more diffuse, such as along the west coast of southern Africa and the coast of West Africa. As evidenced by acoustic detections, part of the population remains in the Antarctic in winter (van Opzeeland <em>et al</em>. 2013).<br/><br/>The currently known wintering grounds, with the names originally assigned by the International Whaling Commission’s Scientific Committee (IWC 1998) but with some subsequent regrouping (IWC 2017), are:<br/><br/>A. Western South Atlantic: Coast of Brazil from Cabo São Roque (5°S) to Cabo Frio (23°S), but especially on the Abrolhos Bank (17-20°S);<br/><br/>B. Eastern South Atlantic: Benin Bight and Gulf of Guinea, from the waters of the Republic of Congo to the waters of Guinea (B1), West coast of southern Africa, including waters of South Africa, Namibia and Angola (B2);<br/><br/>C. Southwestern Indian Ocean: Coast of Natal, northeastern South Africa &#160;East Africa, including waters of Mozambique, Tanzania (incl. Zanzibar), Mayotte and the Comoros Islands (C1+C2), Eastern and southern Madagascar, Réunion and Mauritius (C3+C4);<br/><br/>D. Western Australia: migration along the west Australian coast to wintering grounds off northwestern Australia;<br/><br/>E. Eastern Australia and Southwest Pacific: Eastern Australia (E1),<br/><br/>F. Oceania: New Caledonia (E2), Fiji and Tonga (E3), Cook Islands (F1), French Polynesia (F2);<br/><br/>G. Eastern South and equatorial Pacific: &#160;Peru, Ecuador, Colombia, Panama, Costa Rica.<br/><br/>The groups A-G were originally considered to represent main breeding populations with the numbered sub-groups representing subpopulations. However, the IWC Scientific Committee subsequently grouped subgroups E2, E3, F1 and F2 together as the Oceania breeding population. Subgroups C1 and C2 were combined, as have C3 and C4.<br/><br/>The feeding ranges of the different populations overlap in the Antarctic, with some movement of individuals around the Antarctic (IWC 1998), but overall the whales appear to feed preferentially in the sectors nearest to their wintering grounds. The sex ratio in the wintering areas tends to be biased towards males, potentially reflecting a reduced presence of females in their non-calving years or a generally shorter residence time of females (Barlow <em>et al</em>. 2011). Rare movements of both sexes between breeding populations have been observed (e.g., western Africa to Madagascar (Pomilla and Rosenbaum 2005) and Brazil to Madagascar (Stevick <em>et al</em>. 2011)).<em><strong><br/><br/>Northern Indian Ocean</strong></em><em><strong></strong></em><br/>There is a resident year-round population in the Arabian Sea, whose range includes the waters of Yemen, Oman, Iran, Pakistan, India, and Sri Lanka (Minton <em>et al</em>. 2011) and which is genetically isolated from other Humpback Whales (Pomilla <em>et al</em>. 2014). However, song types characteristic of Humpback Whales in the southwestern Indian Ocean have been detected off Oman (Cerchio <em>et al</em>. 2018); this could indicate the presence of Humpbacks from different populations in the Arabian Sea, or that Arabian Sea Humpbacks sometimes venture further afield and acquire new songs.<br/><br/>Only a few calves have been seen in the Arabian Sea, but from foetus sizes in pregnant whales captured in November 1966, Mikhalev (1997) concluded that the peak calving season is probably in February, with some spread. This is in contrast to Southern Humpback Whales, where peak calving occurs in July-August (Clapham and Mead 1999).<br/><br/>There have been a few records in the Persian Gulf, including the type specimen for <em>M. indica</em> (Gervais 1883) assumed to be a Humpback Whale; these were previously regarded as vagrants, but it is now thought that the regular range extends into the Persian Gulf (Dakhteh <em>et al</em>. 2017).<br/><br/>Humpback Whales seem to be quite rare in Indian waters (Afsal <em>et al</em>. 2008) but there have been occasional strandings (Sutaria 2018) and acoustic detections (Madhusudhana <em>et al</em>. 2018) along the west coast. Of 14 individuals satellite-tagged off Oman during 2014-17, one was tracked to Goa and thence to the southern tip of India by January 2018 and back to the tagging site by March 2018 (Willson <em>et al</em>. 2018). Two specimens from the west coast of Sri Lanka (a bycatch in 1981 and a stranding in 1990) (Ilangakoon 2006) and Humpback Whale songs have been during February and March 1982 in the Gulf of Mannar, NW Sri Lanka (Whitehead 1985). Humpback Whales seem to be rare or absent in the northeastern Indian Ocean and the Bay of Bengal.<br/><br/>There have been several sightings over the past 10 years in the northern Red Sea, including the Gulf of Aqaba, but the provenance of those Humpback Whales is unclear (Notarbartolo di Sciara <em>et al</em>. 2017).</p><p></p>","<p>  </p><p>Large-scale exploitation of this species has ceased, but hunting for local consumption continues in Greenland and the island of Bequia (eastern&#160; Caribbean) (IWC 2018b).

The last substantial catches occurred in 1968. Despite having been severely depleted to a world population in the low thousands at that time, Humpbacks have recovered strongly to a world population that is estimated at over 80,000 mature animals and is increasing.<br/><br/>Humpback Whales enjoy additional protective measures, such as sanctuaries, in a number of countries.

Data Deficient was considered as still potentially applicable in this assessment. Clarifying language in the Red List Guidelines (Version 14, 2019) states that: “If the data are so uncertain that both CR and LC are plausible categories, the taxon can be listed as DD.” Although the information is sparse, this species appears to occur in a variety of locations and around the northern rim of the North Pacific, and the category of CR cannot be plausibly applied. Therefore, it was concluded that the species does not belong in the DD category. </p>  <p>Stejneger’s Beaked Whale appears to be uncommon (see Supplementary Information for definitions of terms etc.). Recurrent mass strandings near a naval facility in the Aleutian Islands indicate that anthropogenic noise could be a serious threat throughout a significant portion of the species’ medium-sized range. Assuming a generation length of about 20 years for deep-diving small whales (Taylor <em>et al.</em> 2008), a population decline of 2%/year, which is plausible for the combined threats documented in this assessment, would result in a 70% decline over three generations and would qualify the species for EN under criterion A4d. However, it is also plausible that the combined effects of all threats to Stejneger’s Beaked Whales are sustainable, which would indicate an LC listing. Near Threatened is chosen as the appropriate category for this data-poor species as the combined threats result in the species being close to qualifying for a threatened category, or likely to qualify in the near future.</p>","Stejneger's Beaked Whales occur mostly in deep water beyond the edge of the continental shelf (Houston 1990; Loughlin and Perez 1985). A peak in strandings in Japan during winter and spring suggests that they migrate northward in summer (Mead 1989; Yamada 1997). Based on evidence from bite wounds from cookiecutter sharks (<em>Isistius</em> spp.), Walker and Hanson (1999) also suggested Stejneger’s undergo seasonal movements to warmer waters where this shark is more common (Dwyer and Visser 2011). Stomach contents from stranded animals in the western Aleutian Islands and Japan were dominated by two squid families – Gonatidae and Cranchiidae; all squid were presumed to have been taken at depths of 200 m or more, and no fish remains were found (Yamada <em>et al.</em> 1995, Walker and Hanson 1999). Pod sizes of up to 15 animals were reported by Loughlin <em>et al.</em> (1982), but species identification for their sightings cannot be confirmed (Pitman <em>et al</em>. 2019).","<p>Little specific information is available on anthropogenic threats to Stejneger’s Beaked Whales (Reeves <em>et al.</em> 2003). </p>  <p>Although formerly hunted occasionally in small numbers off Japan, currently there is no directed hunt for this species. Drift gillnets and longlines (both active and abandoned) are abundant and widespread in the ocean, and mesoplodonts, including this species, are known to become entangled and drown in such gear in the Sea of Japan and California (Nishimura and Nishiwaki 1964, Julian and Beeson 1998, Park 1999). The full extent of the entanglement threat to Stejneger’s Beaked Whale is unknown.</p>  <p>In recent years, there has been increasing evidence that loud underwater sounds, such as active sonar and seismic operations, can be harmful to beaked whales (Cox <em>et al.</em> 2006).

Ingestion of plastic in the ocean by marine organisms is a widespread and increasing problem, and possibly a significant cause of mortality among cetaceans, especially beaked whales (Simmonds 2012, Fossi <em>et al</em>. 2018). The specific threats include macroplastic items that can physically block the digestive tract and lead to death (Secchi and Zarzur 1999), and microplastics (&lt;5 mm; Baulch and Perry 2014, Lusher <em>et al.</em> 2015) that can leach toxic chemicals (Baini <em>et al.</em> 2017). Plastic twine was found in the digestive tracts of two Stejneger’s Beaked Whales, and Walker and Hanson (1999) suggested that this material was ingested incidentally during suction feeding. Yamada <em>et al</em>. (2012) reported that ca. 73% of the stranded specimens in Japan had plastic material in their stomachs. </p>  <p>Organochlorine residues have been identified in various other species of mesoplodonts (Miyazaki <em>et al.</em> 1987, Kajiwara<em> et al</em>. 2006, Bachman <em>et al.</em> 2014, Anezaki <em>et al</em>. 2016). The levels of these residues in mesoplodonts are generally lower than in other small cetaceans but Stejneger’s Beaked Whale is an exception. The organochlorine levels in this species, at least in Japanese waters, are the highest reported for any species of beaked whale and may represent a potential health hazard of unknown significance</p>  <p>Mesoplodonts are small whales that live far offshore; mortality from ship strikes is difficult to document, but some possible cases were reported by Waring <em>et al</em>.

There may be a resident subpopulation in the Sea of Japan and southern Okhotsk Sea (Yamada 1997, Walker and Hanson 1999, Kakuda and Yamada 2001, Tajima <em>et al.</em>&#160;2015).</p>",Decreasing,"<p>Stejneger's Beaked Whales are found in continental slope and oceanic waters of the North Pacific Ocean, from southern California northward in the east and from the Sea of Japan, including the Korean Peninsula (Park 1999), northward into the southern Okhotsk Sea in the west.

Stejneger’s Beaked Whale appears to be primarily a cold-temperate and subarctic species, and it is the only mesoplodont found in Alaskan waters.

50368125,15421,Orcinus orca,Data Deficient,,2017,2017-06-20 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<p>The Killer Whale, as the taxon is presently defined and recognized (Society for Marine Mammalogy 2017), does not meet any of the IUCN Red List criteria for a threatened status. Killer Whales are numerically abundant (at least tens of thousands of mature individuals) and very widely distributed. Experts agree that the present taxon likely includes more than one subspecies, and possibly multiple species. Some small regional populations are known to have declined significantly and would easily qualify for a threatened status if assessed individually (e.g., ENP southern residents, the Bluefin Tuna-dependent population associated with the Strait of Gibraltar), but there is insufficient evidence to support a global decline in the species abundance that would make it meet Criterion A. However, the statement in the previous species assessment (Taylor <em>et al</em>. 2013) still holds: “The combination of potential declines driven by depletion of prey resources and the effects of pollutants is believed sufficient that a 30% global reduction over three generations (77 years; Taylor <em>et al</em>. 2007) cannot be ruled out for some ‘groups’ that may [eventually] be designated as species.” <br/></p>  <p>Although considerable effort continues to be made on improved understanding of the taxonomy of the genus <em>Orcinus</em>, the taxonomic issues have not been fully resolved. This is especially problematic due to the occurrence of sympatric, non-interbreeding ecotypes in the ENP, Antarctic, and possibly elsewhere. The taxon has previously been listed by IUCN as Data Deficient due to taxonomic uncertainty, and that listing should be continued until proper taxonomic units are described and Red List assessments of them can be carried out.</p>","<p>Killer Whales are known to   feed on a wide array of prey, including most marine mammal species (except river dolphins and Manatees), seabirds, sea turtles, many species of fish   (including sharks and rays) and cephalopods (Dahlheim and Heyning 1999, Ford   and Ellis 1999, Ford 2009). They have a diversity of foraging tactics,   including intentional beaching to capture pinnipeds on shore, creating waves   to wash seals off ice floes, and using cooperative techniques to herd fish   and to attack large prey such as Tuna and large whales (Dahlheim and Heyning   1999, Baird 2000, Pitman and Durban 2012).</p><p>Although Killer Whales are a generalist as a species, at least some   subpopulations (ecotypes and/or morphotypes) specialize on particular types   of prey (Bigg <em>et al</em>. 1990, Baird 2000). Studies in coastal waters of   the ENP, from California to Alaska, have described three distinct ecotypes of   Killer Whales, referred to as residents, transients (or Bigg’s Killer Whales),   and offshores. Although distinguished by ecological differences, there are   also differences in coloration, external morphology, behavior and acoustics   (Ford and Ellis 2014). The three ecotypes maintain social isolation from each   other (<em>i.e</em>., no interbreeding)   despite sometimes overlapping ranges. The ENP residents are Pacific Salmon   specialists and have a strong preference for one species, the Chinook Salmon   (Ford and Ellis 2006). Transients in coastal waters of the ENP focus their   foraging on pinnipeds and small cetaceans but also take large whales, especially   calves, opportunistically. Killer Whales in coastal Norway specialize on Herring   (Simila <em>et al</em>. 1996) and in the Strait of Gibraltar on Bluefin Tuna   (Cañadas and de Stephanis 2006). Some Killer Whales in New Zealand may forage   selectively on rays and other elasmobranchs (Visser 1999), and in Western   Australia, Killer Whales take scores of Humpback Whale calves for several   months a year (Pitman <em>et al.</em> 2015).   Off the south coast of Western Australia one group of Killer Whales forages,   at least seasonally, on Beaked Whales (Wellard <em>et al</em>. 2106). In the Antarctic, there are five described ecotypes   of Killer Whales, each of them morphologically distinct with different   habitat and prey preferences. One type specializes on Minke Whales and Elephant   Seals taken in open water, one eats mostly ice-associated seals taken off ice   floes, another regularly preys on penguins but is probably mainly a   fish-eater, another rarely seen form has only been observed depredating Patgonian   Toothfish from commercial longlines, and the smallest form appears to be   entirely a fish-eater (Pitman and Ensor 2003, Pitman <em>et al.</em> 2011, Durban <em>et al.</em>   2016). <br/></p>   <p>Long-distance migrations   have been documented for high-latitude Killer Whales. Matthews <em>et al</em>. (2011) satellite-tracked an   individual for 5,400 km (and 38° of latitude) from the eastern Canadian   Arctic into the central North Atlantic. Durban and Pitman (2012) tracked Killer   Whales from the Antarctic Peninsula to southern Brazil and back – a non-stop   roundtrip of almost 9,400 km, and Pitman <em>et   al</em>. (in prep.) tracked fish-eating ecotype Killer Whales from the Ross   Sea to north of New Zealand and back – a &gt;11,000 km roundtrip covering 48°   of latitude. Many Antarctic Killer Whales appear to be highly philopatric. In   the Antarctic, some ecotypes readily enter areas of floe ice in search of   prey, while others hunt only in open water (Pitman and Ensor 2003, Pitman and   Durban 2012). Killer Whales in some areas congregate seasonally in coastal   channels to forage and occasionally enter river mouths.</p>","<p>Killer Whales have been exploited (i.e., deliberately hunted) in several regions. Norwegian whalers in the eastern North Atlantic took an average of 56 whales per year from 1938 to 1981. Whalers in Japan took an average of 43 per year in coastal waters from 1946 to 1981. Soviet commercial whalers took an average of 26 Killer Whales annually from 1935 to 1979, primarily in the Antarctic, and then took 916 animals in the 1979/80 Antarctic season (Dahlheim and Heyning 1999,). Killer whales are also taken in small numbers for food (or as a population control measure) in coastal fisheries in Japan, Greenland, Indonesia, and the Caribbean islands (Reeves <em>et al</em>. 2003).<br/> <br/> Fishermen in many areas see Killer Whales as competitors, and intentional shooting is known to occur. This problem was especially serious in Alaska, where depredation of longline fisheries is extensive (Jefferson <em>et al</em>. 1993, Yano and Dahlheim 1995, Donohue <em>et al</em>. 2003), and retaliation for depredation was credited with contributing to a temporary population decline at Crozet Island, in the Southern Ocean (Poncelet <em>et al</em>. 2010). Depredation of longline catches appears to be a recent and increasing phenomenon, and now occurs in many regions (e.g., Aleutian Islands and Southeast Alaska, South Georgia, Crozet Islands, and several other Southern Ocean Subantarctic island areas, Australia, and other locations in the South Pacific). Increased depredation of Toothfish hooked in fisheries in the Crozet Archipelago appears to have had a positive effect on calving rates of female Killer Whales (Tixier <em>et al.</em> 2015).<br/> <br/> Incidental mortality in trawl, longline and driftnet fishing operations occurs, but is considered rare (Dahlheim and Heyning 1999, Muto <em>et al</em>. 2016).<br/> <br/> Persistent bio-accumulating contaminants present a serious potential risk to some Killer Whale populations. Ross <em>et al</em>. (2000) reported that total polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) concentrations were very high in three Killer Whale populations (2 resident and 1 transient) frequenting the coastal waters of British Columbia, Canada. Transient Killer Whales were particularly contaminated due to their high trophic position in the marine ecosystem. PCB levels in most Killer Whales sampled were greater than levels established at which adverse effects occur in Harbor Seals, suggesting that the majority of free-ranging Killer Whales in this region are at risk of toxic effects. The southern resident and transient Killer Whales of British Columbia and Washington are considered among the most PCB-contaminated cetaceans in the world (Ross <em>et al</em>. 2000). &#160;More recently, Jepson <em>et al</em>. (2016) found very high mean blubber PCB concentrations in Killer Whales in Europe. Small or declining populations of Killer Whales in the northeastern Atlantic (e.g., the very small population associated with the Strait of Gibraltar) have been associated with low recruitment, which is consistent with PCB-induced reproductive toxicity. Also, increasing levels of polybrominated diphenyl ethers which, like PCBs, can cause immunotoxicity, neurotoxicity, and reproductive impairment, have become a concern in the southern resident population in British Columbia and Washington (Mongillo <em>et al</em>. 2012).</p>  <p><br/> Disturbance is another concern in areas where Killer Whales are subject to whale-watching tourism. Moving boats can disrupt foraging and resting, and underwater boat noise can affect social and echolocation signals of the whales or otherwise interfere with foraging (Erbe 2002, Williams <em>et al</em>. 2002, Noren <em>et al.</em> 2009). For example, close approaches by whale-watching vessels have been shown to result in avoidance responses by resident Killer Whales in British Columbia, which presumably has energetic costs to whales that are frequently subjected to this activity (Williams <em>et al</em>. 2002, 2006). Fast-moving boats in the proximity of Killer Whales also present a risk of vessel strikes (e.g., Visser 1999). </p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p>Potential disturbance and acoustic masking effects of increasing ambient noise levels associated with shipping and other vessel traffic is a growing concern in some regions (Williams <em>et al</em>. 2014). Disturbance responses and masking of echolocation signals in areas with heavy ship activity have the potential to disrupt foraging behavior and reduce prey acquisition with possible population-level consequences (Williams <em>et al</em>. 2014, Veirs <em>et al.</em> 2016).<br/> <br/> </p>  <p>The <em>Exxon Valdez</em> oil spill in Alaska in March 1989 was strongly correlated with the subsequent loss of Killer Whales from transient and resident pods that had been seen swimming near or through oil slicks early in the spill (Dahlheim and Matkin 1994). The AT1 pod had at least 22 individuals when first censused in 1984, before the spill. Eleven individuals have been missing from this pod since 1990 and two more since 1992. Four more whales from this pod died in the early 2000s and there have been no recorded births within the pod since 1984. As of 2012, only 7 of the original 22 AT1 pod members remained. A resident Killer Whale pod affected by the oil had failed to recover 16 years after the spill (Matkin <em>et al.</em> 2008, 2012). Oil spills may also have indirect effects on Killer Whales by reducing prey abundance. </p>  <p><br/> There have been large-scale reductions in predatory fish populations (Myers and Worm 2003; Baum <em>et al</em>. 2003) along with overfishing and collapse of several important “prey” fish stocks worldwide (Jackson <em>et al</em>. 2001). There have also been large declines in some marine mammal populations but many of those populations have recovered or are recovering under protection, and this may mean that some mammal-eating populations of Killer Whales are recovering as well. The same is not likely true of many fish-eating populations, however. </p>  <p><br/> Due to their dietary specialization, some populations of Killer Whales could be especially vulnerable to a reduction of their food supply. In British Columbia and Washington State, many Pacific Salmon stocks have significantly declined as a result of overfishing, habitat degradation, and reduced survival at sea. Declines in survival and reproductive rates of resident Killer Whales were found to correlate with a multi-year reduction in Chinook Salmon abundance in coastal British Columbia and Washington State (Ward <em>et al.</em> 2009, Ford <em>et al.</em> 2010). Mammal-eating Killer Whales along the west coast of North America likely experienced periods of reduced prey availability due to depletion of pinniped populations prior to 1970 (Ford and Ellis 1999). Depletion of Bluefin Tuna stocks in the Mediterranean Sea has almost certainly had a serious impact on the survival of Killer Whales near the Strait of Gibraltar (Cañadas and de Stephanis 2006, Esteban <em>et al</em>. 2016).<br/> <br/> How global climate change and its impacts on the marine environment will affect the different populations and ecotypes of Killer Whales is uncertain (e.g., Learmonth <em>et al</em>. 2006). However, in the Arctic, declining extent and duration of sea ice has given Killer Whales more access to marine mammal prey (Belugas, Narwhals, Bowhead Whales) that depend on ice for refuge from predation (Ferguson <em>et al.</em> 2010, Higdon <em>et al</em>. 2012, George <em>et al.</em> 2015). Similarly, in the Antarctic, the abundance and availability of Killer Whale prey is mediated through the presence of ice (<em>e.g</em>., Pitman and Durban 2012), which means that many species, including both Killer Whales and their prey, face an uncertain future.</p>","<p>Killer Whale populations   have been relatively well-studied in the North Pacific. In the Eastern Tropical   Pacific, a line-transect survey resulted in an estimate of 8,500 (CV=0.37) in   1986-1990 (Wade and Gerrodette 1993). A catalogue of 86 individuals was   compiled for waters around the Baja California peninsula, Mexico, from   1972-1997 (Guerrero-Ruiz <em>et al</em>. 1998). A shipboard line-transect   survey of the Hawaii EEZ in 2002 resulted in an estimate of 349 (CV = 0.98) Killer   Whales (Barlow 2006). The southern resident population that inhabits the   inland waters of Washington State and southern British Columbia numbered 77   whales in June 2017 (K.C. Balcomb, Center for Whale Research, pers. comm., 13   June 2017); it is depleted due to past live removals and is listed as   endangered under the U.S. Endangered Species Act and Canada’s Species at Risk   Act. The northern resident population in British Columbia numbered 290 in   2014 and had been increasing at a mean rate of 2.2% per annum since 1974   (Towers <em>et al</em>. 2015). A   photographic catalogue of the west coast transient population in British   Columbia and Southeast Alaska included 272 individuals in 2012 (Towers <em>et al.</em> 2012). This population was   estimated to have increased at an average annual rate of about 2% in the two   decades ending in 2006 (Ford <em>et al</em>.   2007). Bayesian mark-recapture modelling estimated that there were 300   offshore-type Killer Whales (95% CL 257–373) in the region from Alaska to   California in 2012 (Ford <em>et al</em>.   2014). Shipboard line-transect surveys extending out to 300 nm offshore in   2005 and 2007 resulted in an estimate of 691 (CV=0.49) off California, Oregon   and Washington (Carretta <em>et al</em>.   2016); these estimates likely include whales from the aforementioned west   coast transient, southern resident, northern resident, and offshore   populations. A line-transect survey from the Aleutian Islands to the Gulf of   Alaska resulted in an estimate of abundance for transient Killer Whales of   251 (CV=0.51) (Zerbini <em>et al</em>. 2007), while the AT1 transient   population (which inhabits Prince William Sound and waters of the Seward   Peninsula, Alaska) numbered only 7 animals in 2010 (Matkin <em>et al</em>.   2012). Over 700 unique individual resident Killer Whales were   photo-identified over the course of a field study during 1984-2010 in coastal   waters of the Gulf of Alaska (Matkin <em>et al</em>. 2014). Only a subset of   pods within this population were regularly encountered, and those pods   increased in abundance at an average rate of 3.5% per annum during the study.   A line-transect survey from the Aleutian Islands to the Gulf of Alaska   resulted in an estimate of 991 (CV=0.52) resident Killer Whales and 251 (CV=0.51)   transient Killer Whales (Zerbini <em>et al</em>. 2007). <br/></p>   <p>The following figures are   available for Killer Whales in the Russian Far East, all representing   photo-identified individuals and therefore “minimum” counts (Filatova <em>et al</em>. 2014, Erich Hoyt, Whale and   Dolphin Conservation, pers. comm. 12 June 2017): Avacha   Gulf/eastern Kamchatka (1999-2013) – resident type 688, transient type 26   (note that rate of new discovery is very low indicating this may be close to   actual levels of abundance, and site fidelity is much higher than in the   Commander Islands); Commander Islands (2008-2013) - residents &gt; 800,   transients 18 (note that rate of new discovery is high so actual abundance is   certainly higher and about 80% of the identified individuals were encountered   in only one year); western Okhotsk Sea (from Udskaya Gulf to Sakhalin Gulf,   mainly Academiya Gulf) (2011-2013) – residents none, transients 55 (note that no dedicated study was carried out, only   opportunistic sightings along with beluga research; also this is the   population that has been subject to live-capture since 2010).<br/>   <br/>   Line-transect surveys have resulted in high estimates of abundance in several   regions in the North Atlantic, 3,100 (CV=0.63) in Norwegian waters in the   1980s (Øien 1990) and 6,618 (CV=0.32) in Iceland and Faroe Islands waters   also in the 1980s (Gunnlaugsson and Sigurjónsson 1990, Sigurjónsson <em>et al</em>.   1989). A long-term photo-identification study in coastal northern Norway   resulted in an abundance estimate of 731 (CI = 505-1059) in 2003 (Kuningas <em>et al</em>. 2014). In central and southern   European waters there are only two known populations of Killer Whales – one   in the Strait of Gibraltar with 39 individuals in 2011 (Esteban <em>et al</em>. 2016) and the other a pod of   nine individuals regularly seen around western Ireland and northwestern   Scotland (Beck <em>et al</em>. 2013). Killer   Whales are not common in the waters off the eastern United States. Line-transect   surveys yielded an estimate of 133 (CV=49%) in the northern Gulf of Mexico in   the early 2000s (Waring <em>et al</em>.   2006).<br/>   <br/>   Several analyses of line-transect surveys have yielded abundance estimates   for Killer Whales around Antarctica (Hammond 1984, Kasamatsu and Joyce 1995);   however, some of the estimates have been considered biased by methodology and   survey coverage (Branch and Butterworth 2001). More recent analyses that   account for some of these biases resulted in an estimate of about 25,000 for   waters south of 60°S (Branch and Butterworth 2001); however, there are still   uncertainties related to coverage of areas in the pack ice, so true abundance   could be higher. Densities are known to vary locally within Antarctic waters,   ranging from very abundant to uncommon (Secchi <em>et al</em>. 2002, Pitman   and Ensor 2003), and it has been recognized that Killer Whale densities are   higher closer to the ice edge and within the marginal ice zone where the   smaller, fish-eating Killer Whales can occur in aggregations of tens to   hundreds of animals (Berzin and Vladimirov 1983, Pitman and Ensor 2003). A   photo-identification study of type C Killer Whales (a small, fish-eating   form) in McMurdo Sound from 2001-2015 estimated a population of at least 370   animals including 70 that were resident in the Sound each year during the   summer; the remainder were mostly just passing through (Pitman <em>et al</em>. submitted). In the Antarctic   Peninsula area, a photo-identification study of the three different ecotypes   that occur there has to date (June 2017) identified at least 372 type A Killer   Whales (specialist predators of Minke Whales; R. Pitman unpublished data).   Photo-identification studies in the Prince Edward Island Archipelago (mainly   around Marion Island) from 2006-2009 estimated a local population there of   around 42 individuals (95% CI=35-50) that prey seasonally on Penguins and Elephant   Seals (Reisinger <em>et al</em>. 2011). In   other parts of the Southern Hemisphere, 119 (CV=0.20) Killer Whales have been   estimated in New Zealand waters (Visser 2000), and 30 were identified off northern   Patagonia, Argentina, during 1975-1997 (Lopez and Lopez 1985, Iñíguez 2001). No   abundance estimates have been made for type D Killer Whales in the Southern   Hemisphere.<br/>   <br/>   According to Forney and Wade (2006), although the available data are far from   complete, abundance estimates for sampled areas provided a minimum worldwide   abundance estimate of about 50,000 Killer Whales of all types. Those authors   noted that the total was likely higher, because estimates were not available   for many high-latitude areas of the northern hemisphere and for large areas   of the South Pacific, South Atlantic, and Indian Ocean.</p>",Unknown,"<p>The Killer Whale is the most cosmopolitan of all cetaceans and may be the second-most widely ranging mammal species on the planet, after Humans (Rice 1998). Killer Whales may occur in virtually any marine habitat but are most common in cold-water areas of high marine productivity, particularly at higher latitudes and near shore (Dahlheim and Heyning 1999, Forney and Wade 2006). Sightings range from the surf zone to the open sea with no clear restrictions of water temperature or depth on their range. The distribution extends to many semi-enclosed seas such as the Mediterranean Sea, Okhotsk Sea, Gulf of California, Gulf of Mexico, Red Sea, and Persian Gulf.<br/></p>  <p>Although Killer Whales occur worldwide, reported densities are 1-2 orders of magnitude lower in the tropics than in the highest latitudes in the Arctic and Antarctic where there has been sampling (Forney and Wade 2006). Killer Whales tend to be more common along continental margins; however, there is some variation in this general pattern that appears linked to ocean productivity. Killer Whales appear to be less common in warm western boundary currents, such as the Gulf Stream or the Kuroshio Current, than in more productive eastern boundary currents, such as the California Current. However, they are also common in cold-water western boundary currents such as the Oyashio and Falkland Currents.<br/> <br/> The map shows the inferred range based on a very large number of observations at sea.</p>","<p></p><p>  </p><p>During the period 1962-1977, at least 65 Killer Whales were live-captured in British Columbia and Puget Sound, Washington (Bigg 1982). In addition, from 1976-1988, 59 Killer Whales were captured alive off Iceland: eight were released, three died and 48 (average 3.7 per year) were exported (Sigurjónsson and Leatherwood 1988). Small numbers of Killer Whales have also been live-captured in Japanese waters (Fisher and Reeves 2005). Killer Whales are still in demand for display in aquariums and amusement parks, especially in China. Most recent captures and exports have been of animals in the Russian Far East (Fisher and Reeves 2005, Filatova <em>et al</em>. 2014). Of 21 Killer Whales known to have been live-captured in the western Sea of Okhotsk from 2012-2016, at least 13 of them were exported to China between 2013 and 2016 (Filatova <em>et al</em>. 2017). </p>  <p></p>",Marine,"<p></p><p>The Killer Whale is listed in Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species and Appendices I and II of the Convention on Migratory Species (CMS). The eastern North Atlantic as well as the ENP populations are included in Appendix II of CMS. <br/> <br/> Further studies on subpopulation structure, abundance and life history are needed for most regions. Regional populations of Killer Whales can be small and highly specialized, and therefore vulnerable to over-exploitation, disturbance, prey reductions and habitat deterioration. Several small populations are already recognized as having a high risk of extinction. Many similarly small and threatened populations may exist worldwide but have not yet been adequately studied and described (e.g., Foote <em>et al</em>. 2013).</p>",Afrotropical|Antarctic|Australasian|Indomalayan|Nearctic|Neotropical|Oceanian|Palearctic,,false,false,Global

They occur primarily in coastal and continental shelf waters. <br/><br/>Harbor Porpoises are bycaught often in fishing gear, especially gillnets, throughout their range and several populations are of conservation concern, including the Baltic Sea subpopulation which is classified as Critically Endangered (Hammond et al., 2016), and the Black Sea subspecies which is classified as Endangered (Birkun Jr and Frantzis 2008). They are also subject to direct hunting in some areas, especially in Greenland. Other factors that likely affect the health of Harbor Porpoises include contaminants, noise, and prey depletion. Despite this, the species remains one of the most widespread and abundant cetaceans in the Northern Hemisphere, available estimates indicate that there are well over a million Harbor Porpoises globally, and there is no evidence that the threats are resulting in a continuing global population decline. This species was listed as Least Concern on the Red List in 2008 and it remains Least Concern in this updated assessment. Despite this, there are some populations, such as the Afro-Iberian Harbor Porpoise population, that are of conservation concern and may warrant separate subpopulation assessment. <br/><p></p>","<p>Harbor Porpoises mature earlier and have shorter gestation and lactation periods and life spans than most other cetaceans. Their normal reproductive cycle is annual.&#160; Throughout their range, Harbor Porpoises are largely limited to continental shelf waters. They typically frequent bays, estuaries, and tidal channels less than about 200 m in depth although in some areas, such as Greenland, they are found regularly beyond the 300m depth contour (Nielsen <em>et al</em>. 2018). Carretta <em>et al</em>. (2001) found that the main distribution of Harbor Porpoises in northern California was in waters shallower than 60 m deep. However, dives to at least 400 m have been recorded via telemetry (Nielsen <em>et al</em>. 2018). <br/> <br/> Harbor Porpoises eat a wide variety of fishes and cephalopods, and the main prey items vary regionally (see Smith and Gaskin 1974, Recchia and Read 1989, Fontaine <em>et al</em>. 1994, Gonzales <em>et al</em>. 1994, Aarefjord <em>et al</em>. 1995, Gannon <em>et al</em>. 1998, Read, 1999, Børjesson <em>et al</em>. 2003, Santos <em>et al</em>. 2004, Reeves and Notarbartolo di Sciara 2006).&#160; Although small schooling fish (e.g. herring) are important, demersal foraging is characteristic in many areas. &#160;In most areas of the North Atlantic, the diet is dominated by just a few prey species from six families (in terms of biomass): Gadidae, Clupeidae, Osmeridae, Ammodytidae, Gobiidae, Carangidae. In terms of prey numbers, other groups with small individual body size, notably gobies, assume more importance. Off the Iberian Peninsula where the continental shelf is narrow, pelagic and offshore species are more important than in most other areas.&#160; Dietary shifts have been seen when important prey have declined in abundance – and originally preferred prey species do not necessarily reappear in the diet of the porpoises when stocks recover. This tendency to switch prey and not revert to ‘ideal’ prey once stocks recover, coupled with their high metabolic rate, makes Harbor Porpoises vulnerable to prey depletion (IMR/NAMMCO 2019).</p>  <p>Surveys in 1994, 2005 and 2016 in the North Sea and adjacent waters showed a shift in distribution from northern to southern areas (Hammond <em>et al</em>. 2002, Hammond <em>et al</em>. 2017), a change that is reflected by increases in sightings from shore in countries like the Netherlands and the United Kingdom (Camphuysen 2004, Thomsen <em>et al</em>. 2006).&#160; <br/> <br/> The ecology of Black Sea Harbor Porpoises may be unusual, reflecting the high degree of geographic isolation of their habitat, the low water salinity, seasonal fluctuations of water temperatures and large amounts of anoxic waters below 100-250 m (Reeves and Notarbartolo di Sciara 2006, Notarbartolo di Sciara and Birkun 2010).<br/> <br/> <br/> </p>","<p><strong>Direct Catches</strong><br/> Harbor Porpoises have been hunted in many parts of their range, e.g. Puget Sound, Bay of Fundy, Gulf of St. Lawrence, Labrador, Newfoundland, Greenland, Iceland, Black Sea, and Danish Belt Seas (IMR/NAMMCO 2019). There is evidence that Harbor Porpoises were harvested by indigenous people in Maine (USA) and the Canadian Maritimes before the 1960s, and the meat was used for human consumption, oil, and fish bait. The extent of these past harvests is unknown, though it is believed to have been small and localized. Many of the above hunts are now closed but Harbor Porpoises are still hunted regularly in Greenland where both their meat and skin are consumed. The Greenland hunt is currently unregulated, however, catches do have to be reported. In Greenland more than 700 per year were taken in 1990-1993 (Teilmann and Dietz 1998). In 2003 the reported catch had increased to 2,320 (NAMMCO 2005). Catches increased between 1990 and 2017, up to an average annual harvest of approximately 2200 animals and a total of 55,495 individuals are estimated to have been killed between 1993 and 2017 (IMR/NAMMCO 2019). These catch statistics may underestimate total mortality because there is a degree of under reporting and because an unknown proportion of animals killed may not be successfully secured by hunters. An annual total removal of 2,900 Harbor Porpoises allows for a 70% chance that the population will increase, but assessment of the population-level impacts of the hunt is hampered by unreliable reporting (NAMMCO 2019) and the sustainability of the current harvest level is questionable. Harbor Porpoises are also hunted and bycaught in the Faroes but quantitative data are lacking (IMR/NAMMCO 2019).</p>  <p>In Japan, there has never been a directed hunt for Harbor Porpoises. Differences in the local names used for cetacean species in Japan in the past mean that catches of other species may have been misreported as Harbor Porpoises (Kasuya 2017). In the Black Sea, large directed takes occurred during 1976-1983. Within that period, the total number of Harbor Porpoises killed was at least 163,000-211,000. Commercial hunting of Black Sea cetaceans, including Harbor Porpoises, was banned in 1966 in the former USSR (present Georgia, Russia and Ukraine), Bulgaria and Romania, and in 1983 in Turkey. Illegal direct killing of unknown numbers of Harbor Porpoises continued in some parts of the Black Sea until 1991 (Reeves and Notarbartolo di Sciara 2006; Birkun Jr and Frantzis 2008).<br/> <br/> <strong>Fisheries Bycatch</strong><br/> Today, the most significant threat to this species in most areas is incidental catch in fishing gear, primarily gillnets. Substantial bycatch rates were documented in the 1980s and 1990s and are summarized in Donovan and Bjørge (1995). Mortality due to bycatch was estimated for the Gulf of Maine (1,200-2,900/year), Bay of Fundy (80-400/year), West Greenland (1,400/year), North Sea (4,600/year) Celtic Shelf (1,500/year), and also off central California (tens to hundreds per year; Barlow and Hanan 1995). </p>  <p>Bycatch in gillnet fisheries off the central coast of California were documented to cause high levels of mortality and population declines of Harbor Porpoises, with a peak in the 1980’s and a gradual subsequent decline when management measures, including fishery closures in some areas, were put in place to protect marine mammals (Barlow and Forney, 1994). Following implementation of these measures, surveys conducted in 1991-1993 did not indicate increases in populations (Forney, 1995), but increases were documented between 2002 and 2007 (Carretta <em>et al</em>. 2009). Bycatch in current fisheries off the Pacific coast of the USA does not appear to represent a population-level threat (Carretta<em> et al.</em> 2018), with the exception of the salmon gillnet fisheries in southeast Alaksa, where annual mortality from bycatch was estimated at 34 individuals, exceeding the calculated potential biological removal limit of 8.9 individuals per year (Muto <em>et al</em>. 2018).</p>  <p>In Japan, 83 bycatch deaths in set nets and bottom gillnets were reported during 2008-2017, most of them in Hokkaido. This number is likely to be only a small part of the actual mortality&#160;(Marine Mammals Strandings Database, National Museum of Nature and Science, Tokyo, https://www.kahaku.go.jp/english/research/db/zoology/marmam/drift/detail.php?id=93). Annual incidental catches and deaths of Harbor Porpoises in the large set nets at Usujiri, Hokkaido during 1992-1997 were reported as <a style=""mso-comment-reference: RR_1;mso-comment-date:20191017T0946"">3.67 caught, and 0.17 dead per net</a>, respectively, because animals enter the nets but often either leave of their own accord or are released by fishers (Iwata <em>et al</em>. 2003). Although the mortality of animals per net is not large, considering that there are about 1,000 large set nets along the coast of Hokkaido, substantial incidental mortality is suspected. </p>  <p>Across the North Atlantic, gillnets, including bottom-set gillnets, tangle nets and drifting gillnets, are responsible for most of the Harbor Porpoise bycatch, and the data were recently reviewed by IMR/NAMMCO (2019). The fisheries responsible for the majority of Harbor Porpoise by-catch tend to be those using medium to large mesh-size gillnets set for species such as cod, hake, turbot, monkfish and lumpfish. The reason for the high by-catch rates in these fisheries is a combination of net type and fishing effort. The observed decrease in bycatch of Harbor Porpoises in some areas is most likely due to a reduction in fishing effort, which is in turn due to a reduction in total allowable catches of the target species.</p>  <p>Along the US Atlantic coast Harbor Porpoise bycatch in set gillnets was estimated as 2,900 individuals/year in the early 1990s. Rates remained near this level until implementation of Take Reduction Plans in December 1998 that included a series of time and area closures and gear modifications which saw bycatch rates drop to approximately 300-900 individuals/year (Orphanides 2009; IMR/NAMMCO 2019). After that, by-catch increased when compliance with rules related to the use of pingers decreased. Harbor Porpoises are still caught in the gillnet fisheries targeting monkfish and other groundfish on the east coast of the United States from North Carolina north along the continental shelf and into the Gulf of Maine (Orphanides, 2009). In the Gulf of Maine/Lower Bay of Fundy (Canada) the total annual average human-caused mortality and serious injury, estimated using observer data from U.S. fisheries in 2011-2015, was 307 Harbor Porpoises (CV=0.16) (Hayes <em>et al.</em> 2018). The majority of this mortality was in the sink gillnet fishery.<br/><br/>The best Harbor Porpoise bycatch estimates for Newfoundland range from 862 (95% CI= 130-2,135) in 2001 to 2,228 (95% CI 315-5,223) in 2003 (Benjamins et al. 2007). Estimates for the Gulf of St. Lawrence and Scotian Shelf stratum range from 2,215 (95% CI= 1,151-3,662) in 2000 to 2,394 (95% CI= 1,440-3,348) in 2001 (Lesage <em>et al</em>. 2004). A preliminary estimate of 1,841 Harbor Porpoises a year is considered as an upper bound for the bycatch in cod gillnets in Iceland over the period 2013-2017 (IMR/NAMMCO 2019). The bycatch rate averaged over a 10-year period for Norwegian coastal waters is approximately 2,300 animals/year (IMR/NAMMCO 2019). In 2017, the Harbor Porpoise was the second-most frequently reported cetacean species to strand on the French Atlantic coast (Bay of Biscay) (6.7% of 1211 stranded individuals) and the most frequently reported species on the French Channel coast (74.1% of 307 stranded individuals) (Dars et al. 2017). Recent monitoring of Danish set-net fisheries in the North Sea revealed an average of 5,591 Harbor Porpoises taken annually in the period 1987-2001 (Vinther and Larsen 2002, 2004), with a significant reduction in by-catch towards the end of the time series as a result of a decrease in fishing effort and fish landings. The north-western Iberian Peninsula is a productive fishing area, and has one of the highest rates of marine mammal strandings recorded in Europe. Harbor Porpoises comprised 7% of strandings in Galicia (López <em>et al</em>. 2002) and 13% of strandings in central-north Portugal (Ferreira 2007). Between 1990 and 2010, a total of 305 Harbor Porpoises were recorded as stranded along the north-western Iberian Peninsula and around 60% of these porpoises bore evidence of fisheries interactions. Preliminary data suggest that this would represent an annual human-caused mortality rate of 4.3-11% of the Iberian Harbor Porpoise population, which is very likely to be unsustainable (F. L. Read <em>et al</em>. 2020). The estimated average annual by-catch across Portuguese polyvalent, purse seine and beach seine fleets in 2010 to 2014 was 906 Harbor Porpoises (IMR/NAMMCO 2019).<br/></p>  <p>A study of cetaceans stranded in the Netherlands examined the gross pathology of 255 Harbor Porpoises and found that in the period 1990-2000, and in 2006 and 2007, between 50 and 60% of the animals showed signs of definite or probable by-catch in fishing gear. A study using remote electronic monitoring and logbooks to monitor bycatch in bottom-set gillnet fisheries in the Netherlands yielded an estimated average of 23 Harbor Porpoises (95% C.I. 2-44) caught per year between 2013 and 2017 – thought to represent between 0.05 and 0.07% of the Netherlands’ Harbor Porpoise population (Scheidat <em>et al</em>. 2018). Evidence suggests that Harbor Porpoise lifespans are shortened in areas of high human activity and increased bycatch risk in the Baltic Sea (Kesselring<em> et al.</em> 2017).</p>  <p>In the Black Sea incidental mortality in bottom-set gillnets is estimated to have been in the thousands annually through the 1980s (e.g., Birkun 2002a). The scale of this mortality has almost certainly increased in recent times owing to the rapid expansion of illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing in the Black Sea (Tonay and Öztürk 2003; Birkun Jr and Frantzis 2008).</p>  <p><strong>Other Threats<br/> </strong>Other types of threats to Harbor Porpoises include chemical pollution, vessel traffic, noise, and depletion of prey by overfishing. Due to their near-shore distribution, Harbor Porpoises are exposed to coastal sources of pollution throughout most of their range. Chemical pollutants (specifically PCBs) have been described as having adverse effects (Hammond<em> et al.</em> 2016). Immunosuppression by contaminants (heavy metals and PCBs) is reported in the eastern North Atlantic (Bennet <em>et al.</em> 2001, Jepson <em>et al</em>. 2005), and a similar cause was suggested for the high rate of infectious disease found in stranded Harbor Porpoises in Canada (Fenton <em>et al</em>. 2017). Following the EU-wide ban of commercial penta- and octa-mix polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDE) products in 2004 (Law <em>et al</em>. 2012), a significant (and consistent) decline was observed in concentrations of brominated diphenyl ethers (BDEs) in marine sentinel species (including the Harbor Porpoise) during the period 2008 to 2012 (Law <em>et al</em>. 2012). Declines were also observed in HBCD, tributyltin (TBT) and organochlorine pesticide concentrations in the blubber of UK-stranded Harbor Porpoises over the same period (Law <em>et al</em>. 2012). Concentrations of PCB, a known endocrine disruptor, in Harbor Porpoise blubber have remained stable since 1997, with mean ΣPCB concentrations in adult male and female porpoises (sampled between 1990 and 2012) exceeding an established mammalian toxicity threshold of 9 mg/kg ΣPCB for onset of physiological (immunological and reproductive) endpoints in marine mammals (Jepson <em>et al.</em> 2016, Kannan <em>et al.</em> 2000, Law <em>et al</em>. 2012). Preliminary results suggest that reproductive dysfunction in UK porpoises, either through endocrine-disrupting effects or via immunosuppression and increased disease risk, is related to PCB exposure.<br/> <br/> Noise pollution in coastal waters is increasing, and seal scarers, which are powerful acoustic harassment devices designed to keep seals away from fish farms and fishing gear, are increasing in number. They are known to deter porpoises at distances of many kilometers, and likely more than 10 km (Johnston 2002, Mikkelsen <em>et al</em>. 2017, Olesiuk <em>et al</em>. 2002). In almost all studies (in captivity and in the field) the reaction of porpoises to sounds has been negative (evasion).&#160; <br/> <br/> Habitat degradation and prey depletion caused by intensive fishing in the Black Sea, together with the explosive growth of populations of invasive species, are considered significant threats for Harbor Porpoises in this semi-enclosed sea (Reeves and Notarbartolo di Sciara 2006). Reduced prey availability coincided with two mass mortality events (in 1989 and 1990) that affected all three Black Sea cetacean species, but primarily Harbor Porpoises (Birkun 2002c). Severe pulmonary nematodosis, caused by <em>Halocercus spp</em>. and complicated by bacterial super-infection, was recognized as the proximate cause of the deaths, which were mainly of young animals.</p>  <p>An explosion at a gas-drilling platform in the Azov Sea in August 1982 resulted in the deaths of over 2,000 Harbor Porpoises (Birkun 2002b).&#160; </p>","<p>No synoptic surveys have covered the entire range of the species across ocean basins, but abundance has been estimated for many portions of the range. In the North Atlantic (including the Black and Azov seas), 18 assessment units have been proposed (IMR/NAMMCO 2019), and in the North Pacific, several population units or stocks have been identified based on genetic studies (Chivers <em>et al</em>. 2002, Taguchi <em>et al</em>. 2010).</p>  <p><u>Pacific Ocean</u><br/> Based on aerial or vessel surveys conducted between 2007-2013 corrected for availability bias, about 68,500 animals occur along the west coast of the USA (including 2,917 (CV=0.41) in the Morro Bay population, 3,715 (CV=0.51) in the Monterey Bay population, 9,886 (CV=0.51)] from San Francisco to the Russian River, 35,769 (CV=0.52) in northern California and southern Oregon, 21,487 (CV = 0.44) in Oregon and Washington , and 11,233 (CV=0.37) in Washington inland waters) (Carretta <em>et al</em>. 2017). </p>  <p>Aerial line transect surveys conducted in summer 1998 and 1999 estimated (corrected for availability and perception bias) about 90,500 Harbor Porpoises (including 11,146 (CV=0.24) in coastal and inland waters of southeast Alaska, 31,046 (CV=0.21) in the Gulf of Alaska, and 48,215 (CV=0.22) in the Bering Sea) (Hobbs and Waite 2010, Muto <em>et al.</em> 2018). Using vessel-based line transect methods, from 2010-2012, there were estimated to be 975 (CV=0.1) Harbor Porpoises in inland waters of Southeast Alaska (Muto <em>et al</em>. 2018, Dalheim <em>et al.</em> 2015).</p>  <p><u>Atlantic Ocean</u><br/> A comprehensive review of the status of Harbor Porpoises in the entire Atlantic Ocean was conducted in 2018 (IMR/NAMMCO 2019), and compiled abundance estimates are available in the online supplementary files here: <a href=""https://nammco.no/topics/scientific-workshops-symposia-reports/#2018"">https://nammco.no/topics/scientific-workshops-symposia-reports/#2018</a> and summarized below.</p>  <p>In the western Atlantic, an abundance estimate of 79,883 (CV=0.32) Harbor Porpoises was generated from a shipboard and aerial survey of the Gulf of Maine and Bay of Fundy in June–August 2011 (Palka 2012, Hayes <em>et al. </em>2018). This estimate is likely negatively biased because no correction was made for availability bias (Hayes <em>et al</em>. 2018). Aerial line transect surveys of the Atlantic coast of Canada in 2016 generated a Harbor Porpoise abundance estimate of 256,355 (CV=0.40), comprised of a Newfoundland and Labrador (NL) stratum with 48,723 individuals (95% CI= 23,566-100,754), a Gulf of St Lawrence stratum with 185,258 animals (95% CI=101,006-286,117), and a Scotian Shelf stratum with an estimate of 20,464 individuals (95% CI=6,831-37,317) (Lawson &amp; Gosselin 2018).&#160; </p>  <p>Abundance estimates for Harbor Porpoises in East and West Greenland were generated from aerial surveys conducted in 2007 (West Greenland only) and 2015 (West and East Greenland). These estimates, corrected for animals that were outside of the survey strata and not counted (based on satellite tracking data), were 69,595 porpoises (CV=0.37; 95% CI= 34,689-139,624) in 2007 and 106,822 (CV=0.35, 95% CI= 55,149-206,909) in 2015 (NAMMCO 2019).</p>  <p>Harbor Porpoise abundance in Iceland was estimated by aerial surveys in 2007 as 43,179 (CV 0.45) individuals; however, since the survey was not designed for Harbor Porpoises this estimate should be treated with caution as it is likely to have underestimated abundance (Gilles <em>et al</em>. 2011, IMR/NAMMCO 2019). Aerial surveys in the Faroes in June 2010 estimated 5,175 (CV=0.44, 95% CI=3,457-17,637) Harbor Porpoises, however these surveys did not cover areas outside the 300 m depth contour and therefore this is considered a minimum estimate (Gilles <em>et al.</em> 2011, IMR/NAMMCO 2019). </p>  <p>Harbor Porpoises (along with Common Dolphins) were the most abundant cetaceans recorded during the SCANSIII survey program in July 2016 in the European Atlantic (Hammond <em>et al.</em> 2017). The program estimated a total of 466,569 (CV=0.154, CI=345,306-630,417) Harbor Porpoises from aerial and ship surveys, which included 24,526 porpoises (CV=0.28, CL low=14,035, CL high=40,829) in Norwegian coastal waters, 24,370 (CV=0.23) in western Scotland, 53,336 (CV=0.24) in the Celtic and Irish Seas, 345,306 (CV=0.18) in the North Sea, 67,691 (CV=0.22) in the Kattegat/Belt Seas/Skagerrak area, and 2,898 (CV=0.32) around the Iberian Peninsula of Spain and Portugal (Hammond <em>et al</em>. 2017, Rogan <em>et al.</em> 2018). Ship-based line-transect surveys between 2002 and 2007 estimated Harbor Porpoise abundance in the Barents Sea as 55,394 (IMR/NAMMCO 2019). Line transect aerial surveys conducted throughout the waters of the Netherlands from May 2008 to March 2010 generated an estimate of 66,328 porpoises (95% C.I. 32,745–125,220; CV=0.34) (Scheidat <em>et al</em>. 2012). No abundance estimates are available for Harbor Porpoises off Northwest Africa.</p>  <p><u>Baltic Sea</u><br/> Abundance of Harbor Porpoises in the Baltic Sea was estimated as 497 animals (95% CI=80-1091) based on two years (May 2011-Apr 2013) of static acoustic monitoring data collected at 304 survey stations (SAMBAH 2016). Aerial surveys were conducted during different seasons in the years 2002 to 2006 to obtain estimates of abundance in the southwestern Baltic. Abundance estimates for the total area ranged from 457 (CV=0.97) in March 2003 to a high of 4,610 (CV=0.35) in May 2005 (Scheidat <em>et al.</em> 2008).</p>  <p><u>Black Sea</u><br/> The results of line transect surveys conducted during the early 2000s in different portions of the Black Sea suggested that the total population of Harbor Porpoises was at least several thousand and perhaps as many as 10,000-12,000 (Reeves and Notarbartolo di Sciara 2006). Ongoing surveys mean that this estimate will be updated in the near future.</p>  <u>Global</u><br/> Taken together, these numbers indicate that the global abundance of Harbor Porpoises is well over a million individuals.",Unknown,"Harbour Porpoises are found in cold temperate to sub-polar waters of the Northern Hemisphere (Gaskin 1992, Read 1999). They are usually found in continental shelf waters, although they occasionally travel over deeper offshore waters. In the North Pacific, they range from central California and northern Honshu to the southern Beaufort and Chukchi Seas (including the Bering and Okhotsk Seas, and Sea of Japan). In the North Atlantic, they are found from the southeastern United States to southern Baffin Island (they apparently do not enter Hudson Bay) in the west, and from Senegal to Novaya Zemlya in the east. They also occur around southeast and western Greenland, Iceland, and the Faroe Islands, and this is the only cetacean species that currently regularly occupies the Baltic Sea. The species occurs in the Black Sea, Marmara Sea, and Sea of Azov, but with the exception of the adjacent northern Aegean Sea, they do not regularly occur in the Mediterranean Sea.","<p>Most directed harvests of this species have now been closed, but they continue in Greenland (NAMMCO 2019).</p>",Marine,"<p>The species is listed in Appendix II of CITES and Appendix II of the Convention on Migratory Species (CMS). It is on Appendix II of the Bonn Convention, Appendix I of the Berne Convention and Annex II of the EU Habitats Directive. Harbor Porpoises are covered under ACCOBAMS (CMS Agreement for the Conservation of Cetaceans of the Black Sea, Mediterranean Sea and contiguous Atlantic Areas) and are ‘managed’ by the North Atlantic Marine Mammal Commission (NAMMCO). The CMS 13th Conference of Parties (COP) in February 2020 adopted a Concerted Action for Baltic and Iberian Harbor Porpoise populations.</p>  <p>The introduction of fisheries bycatch mitigation measures, including time/area closures, off California and in inland waters of Washington State, effectively reduced Harbor Porpoise mortality and led to population increases over time (Forney 1995, Carretta et <em>al. </em>2009).</p>  <p>In the North Sea, bycatch (incidental mortality) has been determined to be above the advised maximum level of removals. The European Union adopted a regulation aimed at reducing the incidental catch of small cetaceans in fisheries in EU waters. The use of acoustic deterrent devices (pingers) has proven to be effective in reducing bycatch mortality for this species without negatively impacting target fish catches (Carlström <em>et al</em>. 2009; Larsen and Eigaard 2014). As such, EU regulations require the use of pingers in some EU gillnet fisheries in the North and Baltic Seas, and the use of onboard observers to monitor bycatch on vessels of over 15 m in length. Recommended improvements to these measures and their implementation include better monitoring, data collection and management to more effectively assess and mitigate bycatch (Dolman<em> et al.</em> 2016), and the use of time area closures in conjunction with acoustic deterrents (Beest<em> et al.</em> 2017). Similarly, on the east coast of the USA, Harbor Porpoises have been the subject of Take Reduction Plans since 1998 that include time and area closures and gear modifications.&#160; </p>",Afrotropical|Nearctic|Palearctic,,false,false,Global
50370912,17032,Phocoenoides dalli,Least Concern,,2018,2017-03-22 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The Dall’s Porpoise is widespread and abundant, with current range-wide population estimates of more than one million animals. These porpoises were killed in large numbers incidentally in high-seas driftnet fishing operations during the 1970s and 1980s, but those fisheries have now been banned, and in most cases, by-catch levels are not now considered sufficiently high to cause population declines. While significant incidental and directed takes in Japanese coastal waters, as well as incidental takes in Russian waters, are ongoing (with combined removals on the order of 20,000 annually, which likely impact local stocks), neither threat is likely to have caused a range-wide decline sufficient to warrant listing in a threatened category. Therefore, given its generally high abundance and fairly wide range, and in the absence of evidence that threats are significant throughout the range, the Dall’s Porpoise is assessed for the IUCN Red List as Least Concern.","This species inhabits mainly offshore deep waters colder than 18°C (Miyashita and Kasuya 1988), but may also occur in narrow channels and fjords in the western North Pacific (Jefferson 1988, Rice 1998). <br/><br/>Sex-biased dispersal is known to occur in this species, and this may have relevance in assessing the impact of takes on regional populations (Escorza Trevino and Dizon 2000).<br/><br/>Dall's Porpoises are apparently opportunistic feeders, taking a wide range of surface and midwater fish and squid, especially soft-bodied species like lanternfishes (myctophids) and gonatid squids. Krill, decapods, and shrimps found in porpoise stomachs occasionally are not considered normal prey (Houck and Jefferson 1999, Jefferson 2002).","The main threats to this species have been incidental takes by salmon and squid driftnet fisheries and directed takes by the hand harpoon fishery in Japanese coastal waters (Jefferson 2018). The Japanese salmon driftnet fisheries began in 1952 and continued until a United Nations moratorium on all high-seas driftnet fisheries came into effect in the 1990s (Reeves <em>et al</em>. 2003). The large-mesh and squid driftnet fisheries operated throughout the central and western North Pacific between about 35˚N and 47˚N; they increased in effort during the 1970s and peaked during the 1980s prior to the moratorium. Bycatch estimates are available only for 1989–1990, when an estimated 4,000 Dall's Porpoises were killed per year (Hobbs and Jones 1993). During the 1970s and 1980s, the combined high-seas driftnet fisheries cumulatively killed tens of thousands in the central/western North Pacific. Although this level was not considered to have been high enough to cause population declines (Hobbs and Jones 1993), Kasuya (2017) stated that, considering the uncertainties around actual mortality levels and abundance, the driftnet fisheries probably did affect at least some of the Dall’s Porpoise populations. The estimated annual take by the Japanese salmon fishery within the United States Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) for the period 1981-1987 ranged from 741 (1987) to 4,187 (1982), with smaller additional takes in Bering Sea waters outside of the U.S. EEZ (IWC 1991; T.A. Jefferson unpubl. data). These salmon driftnet fisheries currently operate in waters of the Russian EEZ, and continue to take about 1,300 Dall’s Porpoises per year there (Artukhin <em>et al.</em> 2010).<br/> <br/> Incidental catches on the order of thousands of porpoises (mainly Dall’s Porpoises but also including some Harbor Porpoises) per year are ongoing in several fisheries using gillnets in the Russian EEZ (Burkanov and Nikulin 2001). Small numbers of Dall's Porpoises are also taken along the Canadian and US west coasts in driftnet and trawl fisheries (Carretta <em>et al</em>. 2006). <br/> <br/> The Japanese hand harpoon fishery for Dall’s Porpoises started in the 1910s (Ohsumi 1972, Sawadate 1983) and had a great expansion around the time of World War II (Wilke <em>et al</em>. 1953, Sawadate 1983), after which kills remained at 5,000–10,000 per year until the 1970s (Kasuya 1982). Approximately 111,500 Dall’s Porpoises were removed by hunting between 1986 and 1989 from two stocks centered in the Okhotsk Sea (IWC 1991). The peak year of this directed fishery was considered to be 1988, when an estimated 45,600 porpoises were taken, significantly more than the official figures reported by the Japanese government (Kasuya 2017). The Japanese government began to regulate the hand harpoon fishery in 1989, and a catch quota was introduced in 1993. The fishery currently operates with quotas of 9,000 for the <em>dalli</em>-type Sea of Japan-southern Okhotsk Sea population and 8,700 for the <em>truei</em>-type Pacific coast-central Okhotsk Sea population (IWC 2002). The current levels of reported takes are about 4% of the mean estimates of the sizes of the populations; however, statistics on removals might not be reliable (Kasuya 2007, 2017). If actual catches are greater, then there is a strong likelihood of population declines. The history of the fishery, quotas, and catch levels were summarised by Kasuya (2017).<br/> <br/> Environmental contaminants are thought to be a threat in some areas, and high levels of organochlorines in particular may reduce testosterone levels in males and affect calf viability, thereby influencing reproduction and survival (Subramanian <em>et al</em>. 1987, 1988).","Dall’s Porpoises are common in many cooler portions of the North Pacific, and density is high in many parts of the range. Total abundance is probably over 1.2 million individuals (Buckland <em>et al</em>. 1993). In the coastal inshore waters of British Columbia, there is an estimated total of 4,913 (coefficient of variation (CV)=29%) (Williams and Thomas 2007). Along the U.S. west coast (California, Oregon, and Washington), the abundance estimates from multiple surveys conducted between 1991 and 2005 ranged from about 35,000 to 134,000, averaging 86,000 animals (CV=45%) (Barlow and Forney 2007). The most recent estimate of Dall’s Porpoise abundance for that coast is 25,750 (CV=45%), calculated from the geometric mean of estimates from 2008 and 2014 summer/autumn vessel-based line-transect surveys (Barlow 2016. Carretta <em>et al.</em> 2017). In Alaska, the abundance is estimated at 83,400 (CV=10%) (Angliss and Outlaw 2005. Muto <em>et al.</em> 2017). In the western North Pacific, the offshore <em>dalli</em>-type population numbers approximately 162,000 (Kasuya 2017). The <em>truei</em>-type population migrating between the Pacific coast of Japan and the central Okhotsk Sea is estimated at 178,000 (CV=23%) (Kasuya 2017). The <em>dalli</em>-type population migrating between the Sea of Japan and the southern Okhotsk Sea is estimated at 173,000 (CV=21%), and the <em>dalli</em>-type population summering in the northern Okhotsk Sea at 111,000 (CV=29%) (IWC 1998, Kasuya 2017). However, some of these estimates are subject to upward biases due to positive responsive movement toward survey vessels. <br/> <br/> The International Whaling Commission’s Scientific Committee currently recognizes 11 stocks of this species, based on differences in genetics, pollutant loads, parasite faunas, and distribution patterns of mother/calf pairs (IWC 2002). Three of them summer in the Okhotsk Sea, two in the Bering Sea, four in the central North Pacific, and two off the U.S. west coast. The wintering grounds are unknown for many of these populations. The populations cannot be reliably distinguished by their external appearance at sea except for the three summering in the Okhotsk Sea, which are distinguishable based on pigmentation and location.",Unknown,"Dall's Porpoises are found only in the northern North Pacific Ocean and the adjacent Bering and Okhotsk seas, and in the Sea of Japan. They inhabit deep waters between about 30° and 62°N (Jefferson 1988. Houck and Jefferson 1999), but occasionally occur as far south as about 28°N off the coast of Baja California (Mexico) during unusually cold-water periods. <br/><br/>The <em>P. d. <em>dalli</em></em> subspecies is the more widely distributed form, and it occurs throughout the species’ range, from the west coast of North America to Japan, Korea and Russia. <br/><br/>The <em>P. d</em>. <em>truei</em> subspecies is identified by a more extensive lateral white patch, and it inhabits only the western North Pacific. The <em>truei</em> subspecies migrates between wintering grounds off the Pacific coast of northern Japan and summer breeding grounds in the central Okhotsk Sea. It constitutes a single population (IWC 2002).",This species is hunted commercially in Japan.,Marine,"The species is listed in Appendix II of CITES. Dall’s Porpoise are also protected by generally applicable marine mammal legislation in Canada and the United States. Catches of Dall’s Porpoises in the Japanese salmon driftnet fishery were limited to some extent by quotas set by the U.S. government, because until the early 1990s the fishery took place largely within U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone waters of the Aleutian Islands. There was a large-scale fishery observer program and extensive biological research associated with this fishery in the late 1970s and 1980s (Jones 1984, Ferrero and Walker 1999).<br/> <br/> The long period since the last abundance survey (over 15 years) means that reassessment of the status of the two populations hunted in the Japanese hand harpoon fishery is needed. Kasuya (2017) summarized information suggesting that both of those populations have decreased in size from the early 1990s to the late 2000s, though thorough biological reviews and status assessments have not been conducted in recent years. The Japanese government sets quotas for this fishery, but these are based on optimistic assumptions about rates of population increase. As such, they could still result in the depletion of populations (Kasuya 2017).",Nearctic|Palearctic,,false,false,Global
50374282,20731,Stenella coeruleoalba,Least Concern,,2019,2018-04-19 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<p>The Striped Dolphin is one of the most abundant cetaceans in tropical, subtropical, and temperate waters around the globe. The sum of available abundance estimates totals more than two million individuals. Estimates are unavailable for most of the species range, particularly in the eastern Atlantic, Indian Ocean, and large portions of the tropical Pacific and therefore total abundance is likely much higher. There is little quantitative information on bycatch rates in most range states, but bycatch certainly occurs in much of the species’ range. Recent evidence suggests that bycatch levels are low in purse seine fisheries of the eastern tropical Atlantic and in the western Indian Ocean. The species has suffered two epizootics in the Mediterranean that caused the deaths of thousands of individuals. Direct removals are substantial in a few areas, notably drive hunts in Japan. The Mediterranean subpopulation of Striped Dolphins is currently listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List because of a suspected reduction in population size of &gt;30% that occurred over the last three generations (approximately&#160;60 years) (criterion A2) based on a 2/3 reduction in mean school size (A2b), a decline in quality of habitat, particularly food availability (A2c), past and current high levels of exploitation in the form of incidental mortality in fisheries (A2d), and the effects of pathogens and pollutants (A2e). </p>Globally, the species remains widely distributed and abundant and it is unlikely that the global population has been, or will be, reduced by as much as 30% over three generations. Striped Dolphins were classified as Least Concern (LC) on the Red List in 2008, and although the species is data-poor in much of its range, given its generally high abundance and pantropical distribution, and in the absence of evidence that threats are significant throughout its extensive range, the Striped Dolphin is again assessed as LC.","<p>Striped Dolphins occur primarily in warm temperate, subtropical, and tropical oceanic regions far from shore. They are seen close to shore only where deep water approaches the coast (Jefferson <em>et al.</em> 2015, Archer 2018). In the North Pacific, Striped Dolphins are associated with oligotrophic waters of the central North Pacific gyre and with more productive upwelling areas in the ETP and along the edges of the California and Kuroshio Current systems (Miyazaki <em>et al</em>. 1974, Reilly 1990, Archer and Perrin 1999, Ballance <em>et al</em>. 2006). In the western North Atlantic, Striped Dolphins appear to prefer continental slope waters offshore of the Gulf Stream (Leatherwood <em>et al</em>. 1976, Schmidly 1981, Perrin <em>et al</em>. 1994). In the Mediterranean, they are associated with highly productive, oceanic waters beyond the continental shelf (Notarbartolo di Sciara <em>et al</em>. 1993, Forcada <em>et al</em>. 1994, Frantzis <em>et al</em>. 2003, Gannier 2005, Panigada <em>et al.</em> 2008). Off South Africa, the species is oceanic, occurring beyond the continental shelf at depths of over 1,000 m, and its distribution is correlated with the warm Agulhas Current (Ross 1984). Within the Mediterranean, there is some evidence of population structure based on restricted gene flow and significant differences in tissue pollutant levels between areas (Calzada and Aguilar 1995, Monaci <em>et al</em>. 1998, Gaspari 2004). The species has been reported in waters from 10°C to 26°C, although most records are from about 18°C to 22°C (Archer and Perrin 1999).<br/> <br/>The diet of Striped Dolphins consists of a wide variety of small, midwater and pelagic or benthopelagic organisms, especially lanternfish, cod, and squid (Wurtz and Marrale 1993, Hassani <em>et al</em>. 1997, Archer 2018). Striped Dolphins feed in pelagic to benthopelagic zones, to depths as deep as 200-700 m, in continental slope or oceanic regions.</p>","<p>The largest directed catches of Striped Dolphins have been in Japanese waters, in drive and hand-harpoon fisheries that date back to at least the Meiji period (1868-1912). Catch statistics are incomplete before 1978, but reported annual recorded catches between 1978 and 1993 ranged between 1,000 and 4,000, except for 1990 when 16,344 were reported as killed (Kasuya 2017). An annual quota of 1,000 Striped Dolphins was established in 1992, this was lowered to 725 in 1993, and there have been minor annual decreases since 2006 (Kasuya 2017). It is likely that the Japanese coastal population of Striped Dolphins suffered the highest mortality, but there is evidence based on mercury concentrations that other populations were also represented (Kasuya 1999, 2017).</p>  <p>In Taiwan, Striped Dolphins are harpooned opportunistically but these are rare events (John Wang pers. comm.). Striped Dolphins have also been taken in the drive fishery at Malaita in the Solomon Islands but they do not form a large proportion of the catch, which typically targets Spinner (<em>Stenella longirostris</em>) and Pantropical Spotted (<em>Stenella attenuata</em>) Dolphins (Oremus <em>et al.</em> 2015, Ross <em>et al</em>. 2003). &#160;Striped Dolphins have been taken by harpoon and gillnet in Sri Lanka (Ilangakoon <em>et al</em>. 2000a,b) and St. Vincent and the Grenadines (Perrin <em>et al</em>. 1994).<br/> <br/> At least until the mid 2000s illegal catches occurred in southern Spain and probably in other areas (SGFEN 2001, Aguilar 2006).</p>  <p>Striped Dolphins are killed accidentally in fishing gear throughout their range, however data are limited for most range states. Mortality occurs in purse seines and gillnets, large mesh pelagic driftnets, and pelagic longline fisheries, and has been documented in the northeastern Indian Ocean, the eastern tropical Pacific, the northeastern Atlantic, the Mediterranean, and in the North Pacific off the coast of Japan (Archer and Perrin 1999). Although rare, Striped Dolphins have been caught in shark nets at&#160;Natal,&#160;South Africa (Perrin <em style=""font-family: Georgia, serif;"">et al</em>. 1994). Between 1985 and 1988 Striped Dolphins comprised 14% of the cetaceans brought in to fish landing sites in Sri Lanka (Ilangakoon 1997).</p>  <p>High seas drift gillnet fisheries operated throughout the central and western North Pacific between about 35˚N and 47˚N, increased during the 1970s, and peaked during the 1980s before a United Nations moratorium came into effect in January 1993. Striped Dolphin mortality was highest in the Japanese large-mesh drift net fishery, with about 3,000 individuals taken in 1990 (Hobbs and Jones 1993). During the 1970s and 1980s, the high-seas driftnet fisheries likely killed tens of thousands of Striped Dolphins in total, but this mortality was not considered to have been high enough to cause population declines (Hobbs and Jones 1993). In recent years, fishery-related mortality of Striped Dolphins along the U.S. east and west coasts, in Hawaii, and in the Gulf of Mexico has been low, and is considered sustainable (Carretta <em>et al.</em> 2017, Waring <em>et al.</em> 2013).</p>  <p>Pelagic driftnets have been a major source of mortality of Striped Dolphins in the western Mediterranean in the past (Tudela <em>et al.</em> 2004). Such nets are still illegally used by Moroccan, French, Italian, and Turkish vessels, resulting in extensive dolphin mortality (Akyol <em>et al.</em> 2012, Silvani <em>et al.</em> 1999, Tudela <em>et al.</em> 2004). The Spanish driftnet fishery in the Alborán Sea reportedly killed 145-183 Striped Dolphins per season in the early 1990s (Silvani <em>et al</em>. 1999); this fishery was halted in 1995 but the nets were transferred to Moroccan boats, which were estimated to kill in the order of 1,555-2,092 Striped Dolphins in 2003 (Tudela <em>et al</em>. 2004). In 1999 and 2000, Striped Dolphins were the most commonly killed cetacean species in the Turkish driftnet Swordfish fishery (Akyol <em>et al.</em> 2012, Öztürk <em>et al.</em> 2001). The Italian driftnet fishery reportedly killed 5,000-15,000 dolphins, mostly Striped Dolphins, per year in the 1980s (Di Natale 1992). The French thonaille driftnet fishery was estimated to take about 180-472 Striped Dolphins per season in year 2000 (Imbert <em>et al</em>. 2001). </p>  <p>Large incidental kills in pelagic trawl and driftnet fisheries off western Europe were a source of concern in the 1990s (IWC 1998, Tregenza and Collet 1998). Results from an observer programme on a driftnet fishery in the eastern North Atlantic in 1996 and 1998 documented marine megafauna mortality rates (Rogan <em>et al.</em> 2007). Using landings of Albacore Tuna as an indicator of effort, the extrapolated decadal data from driftnet fleets operating in this region estimated that over the period 1990–2000 24,358 dolphins were killed, of which 12,635 (10,009–15,261) were Striped Dolphins (Rogan <em>et al.</em> 2007). In the southwestern Atlantic, bycatch of Striped Dolphins was noted by Zerbini and Kotas (1998) off Brazil.</p>  <p>Tissue levels of organochlorine compounds, some heavy metals and selenium in Mediterranean Striped Dolphins are high and exceed ‘safe’ threshold levels for mammals (Cardellicchio <em>et al</em>. 2000, Monaci <em>et al</em>. 1998, Aguilar 2000, Storelli <em>et al</em>. 2012). Organochlorine levels, in particular, greatly exceed thresholds of reproductive impairment in Bottlenose Dolphins (<em>Tursiops</em> spp.) elsewhere (Aguilar 2006, Storelli <em>et al.</em> 2012, Munson <em>et al</em>. 1998). Blubber concentrations of DDT and PCB, the two main organochlorine pollutants, may be declining slowly (Aguilar and Borrell 2005) but were still high in many parts of the Mediterranean in the early 2000s (Storelli <em>et al</em>. 2012). Extremely high concentrations of heavy metals, DDT and PCBs have also been reported in specimens from Japan (Tanabe <em>et al</em>. 1983). </p>  <p>Mass mortality events involving Striped Dolphins in the Mediterranean Sea occurred during 1990-1992 and 2006-2007, both caused by morbillivirus infection (Domingo <em>et al</em>. 1990, Keck <em>et al</em>. 2010). These epizootics resulted in many thousands of deaths and devastated the Mediterranean Striped Dolphin population (Bortolotto <em>et al</em>. 1992, Aguilar and Raga 1993, Raga <em>et al.</em> 2008). The primary immediate cause of the die-offs was the disease. PCBs and other organochlorine pollutants with the potential for immunosuppressive effects might have played a role in, or enhanced the spread and lethality of, the first event (Aguilar and Borrell 1994). However, data from the second event did not support that hypothesis (Castrillon <em>et al.</em> 2010).</p>  Commercially exploited fish and cephalopod species are important components of Striped Dolphin diet in the Mediterranean (Pulcini <em>et al</em>. 1993, Blanco <em>et al</em>. 1995). As many of those stocks (e.g., European Anchovies) have been depleted by commercial fisheries, reduced prey availability is a potentially significant threat to the Striped Dolphin population (Aguilar 2006) and may have contributed to the 1990-1992 epizootic (Aguilar 2000). <br/> <br/> In 2004 and 2005, two unusual strandings in Taiwan included Striped Dolphins (Wang and Yang 2006). The cause(s) of the deaths of these animals were not been determined but human (but non-fishing) activities were likely responsible.","<p>Striped Dolphin abundance in the western North Pacific was estimated as 570,000 (coefficient of variation (CV) = 19%) based on sighting data collected during 1983-1991 (Miyashita 1993). Two areas of Striped Dolphin concentration were identified, one between 20° and 30°N with about 52,682 animals (CV = 95%) and the other between 30° and 40°N with about 497,725 (CV = 18%) animals. In the nearshore waters of Japan, 19,631 Striped Dolphins (CV = 70%) were estimated (Kasuya 1999). </p>  <p>In the eastern tropical Pacific (ETP), a 2003 line-transect survey estimated 1,470,854 individuals (CV = 15%) (Gerrodette <em>et al</em>. 2005). The most recent estimate of abundance for waters of California-Oregon-Washington in the U.S.A., calculated from the geometric mean of estimates from 2008 and 2014 summer/autumn vessel-based line-transect surveys, was 29,211 (CV = 0.20) animals (Barlow 2016, Carretta <em>et al.</em> 2017). This estimate includes correction factors for animals missed during the surveys. Abundance along the U.S. west coast varies seasonally, but no long-term trends have been detected (Carretta <em>et al</em>. 2017). A 2010 shipboard line-transect survey of the Hawaiian Islands EEZ resulted in an abundance estimate of 20,650 (CV = 0.36) Striped Dolphins (Bradford <em>et al.</em> 2013, Carretta <em>et al</em>. 2017). </p>  <p>The total number of Striped Dolphins off the U.S. and Canadian Atlantic coasts is unknown, although several estimates from specific regions for certain time periods are available (Waring <em>et al</em>. 2013). Sightings are almost exclusively in the continental shelf edge and slope areas west of Georges Bank. The best estimate for Striped Dolphins in the western North Atlantic is 54,807 (CV = 0.3) from a 2011 survey (Waring<em> et al.</em> 2014). The best available estimate for the northern Gulf of Mexico is 1,849 (CV = 0.77) from a summer 2009 survey covering waters from the 200-m isobath to the seaward extent of the U.S. EEZ (Waring <em>et al.</em> 2013). </p>  <p>Ballance and Pitman (1998) reported that the Striped Dolphin was the second-most abundant species sighted in the western tropical Indian Ocean (14% of all cetaceans, compared to 33% for the ETP and 10% for the Gulf of Mexico). </p>  <p>Aerial and ship-board line transect surveys of European Atlantic waters in summer 2016 resulted in an estimate of 372,340 (CV = 33%) for the Striped Dolphin, which was the third most abundant species recorded. Striped Dolphins were strongly concentrated in offshore waters (Hammond <em>et al.</em> 2017).The Striped Dolphin is the most abundant cetacean in the Mediterranean Sea. Abundance in the western Mediterranean, excluding the Tyrrhenian Sea, was estimated in 1991 at 117,880 (95% confidence interval (CI) = 68,379-214,800) (Forcada <em style=""font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 9pt;"">et al</em>. 1994). There is no estimate for the eastern Mediterranean Sea. Line transect surveys of the Pelagos Sanctuary located in the Northwest Mediterranean in August 2008 estimated Striped Dolphin population size as 13,232 (CV = 35.5% (Lauriano <em style=""font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 9pt;"">et al.</em> 2009), which was only about half of that estimated by a survey conducted in 1992 in the same area with comparable effort and platform (N = 25,614; CV = 25.3%) (Forcada <em style=""font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 9pt;"">et al</em>. 1995). In the same area, two aerial surveys were conducted in winter and summer 2009 and Striped Dolphins were estimated in winter to number 19,462 (95% CI = 12,939–29,273) and in summer 38,488 (95% CI = 27,447–53,968) (Panigada <em style=""font-family: Georgia, serif; font-size: 9pt;"">et al</em>. 2011).</p>",Unknown,"<p>The Striped Dolphin is a widely-distributed species, found in tropical to warm-temperate waters of the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian oceans, as well as many adjacent seas, including the Mediterranean (Jefferson <em>et al.</em> 2015, Archer 2018). Northern and southern range limits are about 50°N and 40°S, although there are extralimital records from the Kamchatka Peninsula, southern Greenland, Iceland, the Faroe Islands, and Prince Edward Island. Striped Dolphins are uncommon in the Sea of Japan, East China Sea, off eastern Taiwan and Ryukyuan waters, and in the Persian Gulf and Red Sea (Notarbartolo di Sciara <em>et al</em>. 2017). Although Striped Dolphins probably occur throughout pelagic waters of West Africa, published records are scarce (Weir 2010).

50379111,23211,Ziphius cavirostris,Least Concern,,2020,2018-10-04 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<p></p><p>The global abundance and trend of Cuvier’s Beaked Whales are unknown but given their range and regional abundance estimates that do exist, the species numbers at least 100,000. They are very widely distributed in oceanic waters worldwide. They are uncommon south of the Antarctic Convergence (60°S) (Branch and Butterworth 2001). Principal threats include high levels of anthropogenic sound, especially military sonar and seismic surveys in the Northern Hemisphere, and fishery bycatch. As a species, Cuvier’s Beaked Whales do not meet any IUCN Red List criteria for a threatened listing and are considered Least Concern. The Mediterranean subpopulation is classified as Vulnerable on the Red List (Cañadas and Notarbartolo 2018).<em> </em>It is likely that other subpopulations exist, and once identified they could be assessed separately.</p><p></p>","<p>Although they can be found nearly anywhere in deep (&gt;200 m) oceanic waters, Cuvier’s Beaked Whale is an oceanic species often associated with steep slope habitat with a marked preference for submarine canyons and escarpments (Azzellino <em>et al</em>. 2008, 2011, 2012, D’Amico <em>et al</em>. 2003, MacLeod 2005, Podestá <em>et al</em>. 2006, Cañadas and Vazquez 2014, Cañadas <em>et al.</em> 2017). Off Japan, whaling records indicate that <em>Z. cavirostris</em> is most commonly found in waters deeper than 1,000 m (Heyning 1989). The species is known around many oceanic islands (e.g., Baird 2016,&#160;<span lang=""EN-US"">Reyes Suárez 2018)., and in some enclosed seas. It is rarely found close to mainland shores, except in submarine canyons or in areas where the continental shelf is narrow and coastal waters are deep (Heyning 1989, 2002) and is mostly a pelagic species that appears to be confined by the 10°C isotherm and the 1,000 m bathymetric contour (Houston 1991, Robineau and di Natale 1995).<br/> <br/> Like all beaked whales, Cuvier's Beaked Whales appear to prefer deep waters for feeding. They regularly dive over 1,000 m and have been recorded diving to a depth of 2,992 m and for up to 137.5 minutes (Schorr <em>et al</em>. 2014, Baird 2019, Shearer <em>et al.</em> 2019). They appear to feed mostly on deep-sea squid, but also sometimes take fish and crustaceans (Heyning 1989, MacLeod <em>et al</em>. 2003, 2005). In the North Pacific West <em>et al.</em> (2017) noted fish in three of 16 stomachs examined, representing 12.1% of prey by mass overall. While five families of fish were documented, one species, <em>Albatrossia pectoralis,</em> made up 97% of the fish prey items documented. In addition, otoliths from the codling family Moridae were found in a specimen from South Africa (Sekiguchi 1994). They apparently feed both near the bottom and in the water column. As with other beaked whales, suction appears to be used to draw prey items into the mouth at close range (Heyning and Mead 1996).</p>","<p>Because of&#160;their offshore occurrence and tendency to feed on deep-sea squid, Cuvier’s&#160;Beaked Whales are probably little exposed to human activities that occur in coastal waters (tourism, many types of fisheries, etc.). However, the few studies carried out on this species highlight one main threat, which is certain forms of human caused underwater noise. This threat affects the species world-wide. Military sonars and possibly high-energy sounds from other anthropogenic sources have repeatedly resulted in the stranding and death of Cuvier’s Beaked Whales. Recent atypical mass strandings (AMSs) of Beaked Whales have been linked to high-powered naval sonar and seismic exploration (e.g., Frantzis 1998, Jepson <em>et al</em>. 2003, Taylor <em>et al.</em> 2004, Fernández <em>et al.</em> 2005). Deployment of military sonar has led to strandings of beaked whales suffering from chronic and acute tissue damage due to the <em>in vivo</em> formation of gas bubbles, possibly the result of decompression sickness (Jepson <em>et al</em>. 2003, Fernández <em>et al.</em> 2005). In particular, several AMSs of Cuvier’s Beaked Whales have been associated with naval activities in the Canary Islands, from the mid- to late-1980s until 2004 (Bernaldo de Quirós <em>et al</em>. 2019). In 2004 a moratorium on mid-frequency active sonar was established by the Spanish Government around the Canary Islands and there have not been any additional AMSs since. Another AMS event occurred in March 2000 in the Bahamas during a naval exercise (Rowles <em>et al</em>. 2000, Anon. 2001). A number of AMS events in the Mediterranean were consistent with naval activity in the region (Podestà <em>et al</em>. 2006, 2016, Cañadas and Notarbartolo 2018). Moore<em> et al</em>. (2018)<em> </em>also reported that AMSs were strongly correlated in locations (Japan, Puerto Rico and Italy) where US Naval fleets were based. Simonis<em> et al. </em>(2020) report that three of eight Cuvier’s Beaked Whale stranding events in the Mariana Archipelago (totaling 10-11 individuals) between 2006 and February 2019 occurred during or within six days after naval activities, and that this co-occurrence was highly significant. This study also highlighted that both single animal and mass stranding events may be sonar-associated. The US Navy is funding research to explore possible mitigation measures. Geophyical surveys which use airguns for oil and gas exploration are also of concern, particularly in the Mediterranean (Podestà <em>et al</em>. 2016, Cañadas and Notarbartolo 2018). A stranding of two Cuvier’s Beaked Whales in the Gulf of California was closely correlated with a seismic survey (Malakoff 2002).<em></em></p>  <p>Never a main target of commercial whalers, Cuvier’s Beaked Whales have sometimes been taken as bycatch in other directed fisheries, such as those in the Caribbean Islands, Indonesia, Taiwan, Peru, and Chile (Heyning 1989, Jefferson <em>et al</em>. 1993). In the Japanese <em>Berardius</em> fishery, Cuvier’s Beaked Whales were taken in the past on an opportunistic basis, with catches varying from 3 to 35 animals yearly (Omura <em>et al</em>. 1955). Although the <em>Berardius</em> fishery still continues, there have been no direct takes of Cuvier’s Beaked Whales for decades (Nishiwaki and Oguro 1972).</p>  <p>Bycatch of Cuvier’s Beaked Whales has been reported in several commercial fisheries. Julian and Beeson (1998) reported a mortality of 22-44 individuals per year in the California/Oregon drift gillnet fishery from 1992 to 1995.&#160;The introduction of the use of pingers in the fishery in 1996 resulted in a complete cessation of bycatch in this fishery (Carretta <em>et al</em>. 2008). Willis and Baird (1998) noted one Cuvier’s Beaked Whale killed in a fishery for flying squid offshore of western Canada in 1986. Notarbartolo di Sciara (1990) reported on two Cuvier's Beaked Whales that were thought to have been killed in the Italian Swordfish (<em>Xiphius gladius</em>) fishery during 1986-1988. Bycatch in the western North Atlantic is very low, with one animal reported between 1994 and 1998 (Waring <em>et al</em>. 2001). Cuvier’s Beaked Whales are occasionally taken incidentally in driftnets in the Mediterranean Sea. Prior to the driftnet ban of 2002, occasional bycatch in pelagic driftnets was reported from Spanish, French, and Italian waters (Banca Dati Italiana Spiaggiamenti 2015, Podestà and Magnaghi 1989). But, there are also reports of entanglements after the ban. During the MED09 survey in the Alborán Sea, a Cuvier´s Beaked Whale was found alive entangled in a driftnet, and two Moroccan driftnet fishing vessels were spotted a few miles away.&#160;</p>  <p>There are reports of ingestion of plastic debris by Cuvier’s Beaked Whales. Two stranded animals in Greece had stomachs with many pieces of plastic bags (A. Frantzis pers. comm., Frantzis 2009), as did a stranded animal in Croatia (Holcer <em>et al</em>. 2007. Other reports are described in Gomerčić <em>et al</em>. (2006), and Podestà and Meotti (1991). Poncelet <em>et al</em>. (1999) described a considerable amount of plastic debris in the stomach of a Cuvier’s Beaked Whale washed ashore on the French Atlantic coast. </p>  <p>Given their diet is primarily composed of deep-water squid, with smaller contributions of fish and crustaceans (West <em>et al</em>. 2017), there is relatively little competition with commercial fisheries (Arkhipkin <em>et al</em>. 2015).</p>  <p>Low levels of organochlorines were reported from Cuvier’s Beaked Whales from Hawaii and Bermuda (Bachman <em>et al.</em> 2014, Knap and Jickells 1983). Low levels of flame retardant compounds were reported from this species (Law <em>et al.</em>&#160;2005). Organochlorine residues have been identified in other species of beaked whales, mainly mesoplodonts (see Miyazaki <em>et al.</em> 1987, Bachman <em>et al.</em> 2014, Anezaki <em>et al</em>. 2016) and is a potential health hazard of unknown significance. However, the residue levels in beaked whales are much lower than other small cetaceans (Cockcroft 1999). High concentrations of mercury, selenium and cadmium have been detected in animals sampled from the Ligurian Sea (Capelli <em>et al</em>. 2008).<em> </em>However, in all reported cases, organochlorine residues found in Southern Hemisphere small cetacean are lower than their Northern Hemisphere counterparts (O’Shea <em>et al. </em>1980, Reijnders <em>et al. </em>2018).</p>  <p>Predicted impacts of global climate change on the marine environment may affect Cuvier’s Beaked Whales, although the nature of impacts is unclear (Learmonth <em>et al</em>. 2006).</p><p></p>","<p>Determining abundance of Cuvier’s Beaked Whales is difficult for several reasons: 1) they are widely distributed in offshore waters of most of the world’s oceans; 2) in areas where multiple species of beaked whales occur some sightings cannot be identified to species; 3) they regularly make long, deep dives and animals may be below the surface and not detected during surveys; and 4) the body size is relatively small and group size is often small making detection in rough offshore waters difficult even if the animals are at the surface.<em> </em>Global abundance of this species is unknown but there are estimates of numbers in some areas. </p>  <p>Wade and Gerrodette (1993) estimated an abundance of about 20,000 (coefficient of variation (CV) = 0.27) Cuvier’s Beaked Whales in the eastern tropical Pacific region (19 million km<sup>2</sup>), but a re-analysis of the same data increased the estimate to about 80,000 after accounting for diving animals that were missed (Ferguson and Barlow 2001). Barlow (2003) estimated Cuvier’s Beaked Whale abundance off the U.S. west coast from shipboard surveys as 8,311 (CV = 0.50) in 1991-1993, 1,876 (CV = 0.81) in 1996, and 1,892 (CV =1.08) in 2001. A survey of that same region in 2014 yielded an abundance estimate of 3,775 (CV = 0.68) (Barlow 2016). A trend analysis of all data from surveys conducted during 1991-2014 estimated the number of Cuvier’s Beaked Whales in this region as 3,928 (CV = 0.67) in 2014, with evidence of a decline in abundance over the study period that occurred mostly between 1993 and 1996 (Moore and Barlow 2013).</p>  <p>Shipboard surveys of the Exclusive Economic Zone surrounding the Hawaiian Islands in 2002, 2010 and 2017 produced abundance estimates of 1,216 (CV=0.77), 338 (CV=1.01) and 4,431 (CV=0.41) in the three years, respectively (Bradford <em>et al</em>. 2020). Cuvier’s Beaked Whales were the most abundant beaked whale of the three species documented in two of the three years (Bradford <em>et al</em>. 2020). Using photoidentification data, Baird (2016) estimated that 52 animals used the west side of Hawaii Island over a four-year study period.</p>  <p>Waring <em>et al</em>. (2014) reported results of shipboard and aerial surveys conducted in 2011 in the western North Atlantic from the lower Bay of Fundy to central Florida and estimated 6,532 (CV = 0.32) Cuvier’s Beaked Whales in the survey area, but these estimates were not corrected to account for those individuals that were diving.<strong> </strong>In an area of 15,765 km<sup>2</sup> off Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, McLellan et al. (2018) estimated between 50 (95% CI 30-80) and 90 (95% CI 110-380) Cuvier’s Beaked Whales, depending on the assumptions used regarding surfacing synchronicity. In summer 2009, surveys dedicated to estimating cetacean abundance were conducted in offshore waters of the Gulf of Mexico resulting in an abundance estimate for Cuvier’s Beaked Whales of 74 (CV = 1.04). The estimate for unidentified beaked whales was also 74 (CV = 1.04), and may have also included an unknown number of Cuvier’s Beaked Whales (Waring <em>et al</em>. 2013). Cañadas <em>et al</em>. (2011) estimated 2,286 (CV = 0.49) Cuvier’s Beaked Whales in the European Atlantic based on ship-based surveys conducted during 2005-2009. This estimate was adjusted for unidentified beaked whales but not for diving. Podestà <em>et al.</em> (2016) estimated that about 100 individuals are found in the northern Ligurian Sea. Using photo-identification off El Hierro in the Canary Islands, Reyes Suárez (2017) estimated 87 (95% CI 73-103) or 84 (95% CI 70-101) individuals over a six-year period.</p>  <p>Cuvier’s Beaked Whales are undoubtedly among the most common and abundant of all the beaked whales, and worldwide abundance is likely to be well over 100,000. There is no information on trends in abundance for any population. except off the west coast of the United States (Moore and Barlow 2013). This is the only widely-distributed beaked whale species for which a global assessment of genetic diversity has been conducted. The results of that study suggest that there is probably little movement of Cuvier’s Beaked Whales among ocean basins (Dalebout <em>et al</em>. 2005). Substantial variation in morphology has been recorded across the range of the Cuvier’s Beaked Whale (Heyning 1989), which suggests the existence of local subpopulations including one in the Mediterranean Sea (Cañadas and Notarbartolo di Sciara 2018). In areas where satellite tagging and/or photoidentification studies have been undertaken (e.g., Hawaii, North Carolina, Ligurian Sea, Canary Islands), limited movements and strong site fidelity has been documented, suggesting substantial subpopulation structure (Baird 2019, Foley <em>et al</em>. in review, Podestà <em>et al.</em> 2016, Reyes Suárez 2018).</p><p></p>",Unknown,"<p></p><p>Cuvier's Beaked Whales have the most extensive range of any beaked whale species (Heyning 1989, 2002, Baird 2018). They are widely distributed in offshore waters of all oceans, from the tropics to the polar regions, in both hemispheres. Their range covers most marine waters of the world, with the exception of shallow areas and very high-latitude polar regions. They are found in many semi-enclosed seas, such as the Gulf of California, Gulf of Mexico, Caribbean Sea, Sea of Japan, and the Sea of Okhotsk (but not in the Baltic,Black or Red Seas). This is the only species of beaked whale regularly found in the Mediterranean Sea (Podestà&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2006).

Neither the current range-wide population size nor the population trend has yet been satisfactorily quantified. No breeding grounds have been located. The species has to date been listed on the IUCN Red List as Endangered under Criterion D, mature population size below 250 individuals which would correspond to about 400-500 individuals in total. Until all the available data from sighting surveys in the Okhotsk Sea and northwestern North Pacific have been comprehensively analyzed to yield a reliable abundance estimate, the taxon remains listed as Endangered, based on a precautionary application of criterion D, even though it is possible that the number of mature individuals exceeds 250. The Eastern North Pacific Right Whale subpopulation is listed separately as Critically Endangered.","Little is known about habitat use by North Pacific Right Whales. By analogy with its congeners (<em>E. glacialis</em> and<em> E. australis</em>) a diet of mainly copepods is presumed.

However, the paucity of historical sightings in low-latitude coastal waters may reflect early depletion of the species on its feeding grounds. There is clearly some northward migration in summer and southward in winter (Clapham <em>et al.</em> 2004), but the location of the wintering grounds is unknown. </p><p></p>","Hunting of Right Whales in the North Pacific by the Japanese began as early as the late 1500s, and by Europeans and Americans in the 1830s, and by 1900 the population had been reduced to a tiny fraction of its original abundance. Although legally protected by the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling since 1948 (and by earlier agreements since 1935) illegal hunting continued until 1971, during which Soviet whaling fleets killed 517 Right Whales in the eastern North Pacific, which may have been the bulk of the remaining population there (Ivashchenko and Clapham 2012, Ivashchenko <em>et al.</em> 2017). <p>  </p><p>There is currently no directed hunting but there have been cases of known and suspected entanglements and ship strikes in the Okhotsk Sea and Kuril Islands, involving at least four whales including one dead (Burdin <em>et al.</em> 2004). Effort is needed to ascertain the frequency of such occurrences, since the low observer effort may mean that most deaths pass unrecorded.</p>  <p>The eastern North Pacific subpopulation appears to be distinct and of extremely small size (only six confirmed females as of 2012) such that its viability may be tenuous. Of the two sightings of Right Whales in 2013 off the  coast  of British Columbia, the first record of this species in Canadian   waters in 62 years, one exhibited a severe but healed injury that was likely from entanglement (Ford <em>et al</em>. 2016).&#160; </p>Experience in the North Atlantic shows that Right Whales are vulnerable to collisions with ships. The projected increase in shipping through the southeastern Bering Sea as the Arctic Ocean becomes more ice-free is a potential threat to the very small eastern North Pacific subpopulation in terms of ship strikes, as well as noise and pollution. Proposed shipping lanes through the Bering Sea and Bering Strait would cross the area designated under the U.S. Endangered Species Act as Critical Habitat for the Eastern North Pacific Right Whale (IWC 2016). It is known that both ships and whales use Unimak Pass through the eastern Aleutian Islands which, like the Bering Strait, represents a choke point; it is not clear if Right Whales occur in the latter area. Efforts are underway to quantify and address the hazard posed by projected increases in shipping (IWC 2016). Overall, the relative remoteness of the area means that carcasses resulting from ship strikes or other anthropogenic causes could easily go undetected, and even a small number of strikes (e.g., less than one per year) could prevent the recovery of the eastern North Pacific subpopulation.    <p></p>","The Right Whale population in the North Pacific is only a small fraction of what it was prior to 19th century whaling. A preliminary estimate of 26,500-37,000 animals taken (including struck and lost) during the period 1839-1909 was given by Scarff (2001), of which 21,000-30,000 were taken during 1840-49 alone. Based on records of encounters of Right Whales by American whaling vessels plotted by Maury (1852) and tabulated by Scarff (1991), areas of highest abundance in summer were the Gulf of Alaska, Aleutian Islands, southern Bering Sea, both coasts of Kamchatka, the Okhotsk Sea, and the northern Sea of Japan. However, the Maury records have been shown to be unreliable in some cases, and the central North Pacific is no longer considered to be an important portion of the historical range of this species (Josephson <em>et al.</em> 2008). Prior to that, there had been catches of Right Whales off both coasts of Japan since at least the 17<sup>th</sup> century (Omura 1986). There is no evidence of substantial prehistorical catches of Right Whales on the Pacific coast of America. There is pictographic evidence that they were taken off South Korea in neolithic times.<p>  </p><p>Brownell <em>et al. </em>(2001) calculated that 742 Right Whales had been taken in the North Pacific since the start of modern whaling (1911), of which many were killed illegally by the former USSR. Since then, new records of this whaling have come to light which show that 775 Right Whales were taken by Soviet whalers from 1935 to 1971; most of those catches were illegal, including 517 in the eastern North Pacific (Ivashchenko and Clapham, 2012, Ivashchenko <em>et al.</em> 2017). </p>  <p>Today, Right Whales are known to occur in the Okhotsk Sea between Sakhalin Island and Kamchatka, as well as in the pelagic waters of the northwestern North Pacific. These whales are currently assumed to constitute a single population, but data on movements between the two areas are lacking.</p>  <p>Based on sightings of 28 Right Whales in 2,688 nautical miles of Japanese-Russian cetacean surveys in the Okhotsk Sea in August and September 1989, 1990, and 1992, Miyashita and Kato (1998) derived a preliminary population estimate of 922 whales (95% confidence interval (CI) 404-2,108) using line-transect analysis. Further Japanese surveys were conducted in the Okhotsk Sea in 1999, 2000, 2003, 2009, and 2010 (Matsuoka <em>et al</em>. 2017). A Russian survey in the northern Okhotsk Sea in August and September 2015 encountered five Right Whales (Ovsyanikova <em>et al</em>. 2015). The full set of surveys needs to be analysed before definitive conclusions about abundance and trend can be made.</p>  <p>There have been about a dozen sightings of Right Whales on the east coast of Japan in the 20<sup>th</sup> century (Brownell <em>et al</em>. 2001). Matsuoka <em>et al</em>. (2017) report a total of 83 Right Whales observed in the northwest Pacific (west of 170°E) during surveys conducted every summer from 1994 to 2016. Most of these were offshore, between 42° and 52°N and 160° and 170°E.&#160; Hakamada and Matsuoka (2016) estimated the abundance of Right Whales in this area at 416 using 2008 data and 1,146 using data from 2011 and 2012. However, these estimates may be positively biased because only those survey years in which Right Whales were seen were used. Matsuoka <em>et al</em>. (2017) summarized all the sightings and effort from all surveys during 1982-2016 by 1 degree squares but noted that further work is needed to obtain a reliable abundance estimate.<br/></p>  <p>In the eastern North Pacific, the few Right Whales observed have usually been alone and in scattered locations. The only exception is an area of the southeastern Bering Sea where small groups of Right Whales were seen in several successive years (LeDuc <em>et al.</em> 2001, Wade <em>et al.</em> 2006). Genetic identification indicated as minimum of 24 individuals but only 6 females (LeDuc <em>et al.</em> 2012). Using photo-identification records from 1998-2013, Wade <em>et al</em>. (2011) estimated a population size of 31 animals for this area, and genetic mark-recapture data produced a similar result. Marques <em>et al</em>. (2011) estimated a total abundance of 25 (95 % CI: 13 – 47) Right Whales in the southeastern Bering Sea (an area of 950,000 km²) from acoustic detections. Three mother-calf pairs were seen in 2004 (Wade <em>et al</em>. 2006).</p>  <p>There have been very few Right Whale sightings in the Gulf of Alaska in recent years despite the fact that the species once occurred commonly across this region. A vessel-based survey off Kodiak in the summer of 2015 failed to observe any Right Whales, although a few acoustic detections were made (Rone <em>et al.</em> 2017). Since 2010, international whale sighting surveys have been conducted each  summer in the North Pacific east of 170°E (not including the Bering  Sea) under the IWC's POWER programme (IWC 2016). During the surveys from 2010 through 2016, only one Right Whale was seen, in the northwestern Gulf of Alaska. However, the 2017 survey in the eastern Bering Sea recorded 18 right whales (a minimum of 12 individuals; Matsuoka unpublished data).</p><p><br/></p>",Unknown,"<p>Catch records from 19<sup>th</sup> century pelagic whaling and more recent Soviet catches show that Right Whales were widely distributed across coastal and offshore waters of the North Pacific, especially in the Gulf of Alaska south to about 50°N, the southeastern Bering Sea, the northwestern North Pacific, as well as the Okhotsk Sea and Sea of Japan (Townsend 1935, Ivashchenko and Clapham 2012, Josephson <em>et al.</em> 2012, Smith <em>et al.</em> 2012). However, it is apparent that the present range is reduced, especially in the eastern North Pacific.&#160; </p>  <p>Today, Right Whales are known to occur during the summer in the Okhotsk Sea, the northwestern North Pacific (west of 170°W and north of 35°N, including the coast of Kamchatka and the Commander Islands) (Matsuoka <em>et al</em>. 2017, Ovsyanikova <em>et al</em>. 2015), the southeastern Bering Sea, the Aleutian Islands, and the northern Gulf of Alaska (Brownell <em>et al.</em> 2001). During the winter, they occur (or at least occurred historically) southward to the Sea of Japan. There are rare recent records from the Taiwan Strait and the Ogasawara Gunto (Bonin Islands, Japan) in the west, and to Hawaii, California, and Baja California Sur (Mexico) in the east (Brownell <em>et al.</em> 2001).</p>Historical catch records of Right Whales reported from the central North Pacific by Maury (1852) are now known to be unreliable in terms of species identification (Josephson <em>et al.</em> 2008). Right whales have on rare occasions been recorded in the Hawaiian islands (Rowntree <em>et al.</em> 1980, Salden and Mickelsen 1999); one of those individuals was resighted in the Bering Sea (Kennedy <em>et al.</em> 2012). Whether Hawaii was, or is, a significant part of the species range, remains unresolved. The same uncertainty pertains to Right Whale sightings off Ogasawara, Taiwan, California, and Baja California. In 2015 one Right Whale was found entangled off the south coast of Korea and was released, the first record there since the last catch by whalers in 1974 (Kim <em>et al</em>. 2015). Two separate sightings of Right Whales were made in 2013 off the  coast of British Columbia, the first record of this species in Canadian  waters in 62 years (Ford <em>et al</em>. 2016).<br/><p>Unlike Right Whales in the Southern Hemisphere and North Atlantic, neither historical nor extant coastal breeding grounds have been identified for North Pacific Right Whales. Subpopulations on the Asian and American sides of the Pacific are regarded as discrete (Brownell <em>et al.</em> 2001, LeDuc <em>et al.</em> 2012) </p>  <p></p>",The North Pacific Right Whale is no longer hunted. It was once the target of major commercial whaling.,Marine,"North Pacific Right Whales have been legally protected from commercial whaling by international agreements since the 1930s, but this has been fully respected in practice only since the 1970s. The species is in Appendix I of both Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species and the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals.

50383813,41759,Mesoplodon perrini,Endangered,C2a(ii),2020,2020-08-23 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<p>Perrin’s Beaked Whale is known only from six stranding records, all from the coast of California; there are no confirmed at-sea sightings. It can be inferred from the distribution of strandings that the species has a restricted distribution in warm-temperate waters of the Eastern North Pacific off California and may also occur to the south in the waters off Baja California, Mexico, based on (as yet unconfirmed) acoustic detections. This is a small distribution when compared with other beaked whales and is the smallest known range of any species in this poorly known genus. The 1991–2014 abundance estimate for pooled <em>Mesoplodon</em> species (which are not readily distinguishable at sea) across the known range of <em>M. perrini</em> is 1,164 (691, CV=0.59 for Southern California plus 473 (CV=0.86) for Central California) (Table 7 in Barlow 2016). Given the occurrence of several other <em>Mesoplodon</em> spp. in the area, this abundance estimate represents an upper bound for <em>M. perrini</em>. The small range of <em>M. perrini</em> overlaps significantly with naval testing ranges off California, where active mid-frequency sonar, known to be implicated in strandings of <em>Mesoplodon</em> species and other beaked whales, is used. Mesoplodonts are also known to be subject to bycatch in drift nets, and to plastics ingestion. An inferred continuing decline is therefore considered probable. Given that the mature population size (which for cetaceans is in the range 35-75% of the total population size; Taylor <em>et al</em>. 2007) is below 2,500, the species qualifies as Endangered under criterion C2a(ii). Because the abundance used is pooled over several species, it is also plausible that this species may qualify as Critically Endangered (CR) with fewer than 250 mature individuals. </p>","<p>Almost nothing is known about the biology of this species. Although there have been no confirmed live sightings, it is assumed that, like all other members of the genus, Perrin’s Beaked Whale occupies oceanic waters beyond the shelfbreak and is a deep diver. A stomach from a stranded Perrin’s Beaked Whale contained two beaks from the squid <em>Octopoteuthis deletron</em>; another contained a single squid eye lens (Mead 1981).</p>","<p>Little specific information is available on anthropogenic threats to Perrin’s Beaked Whale (Reeves <em>et al.</em> 2003).<br/><br/>Although there has never been a directed hunt for this species, drift gillnets and longlines (both active and abandoned) are abundant and widespread in the ocean, and mesoplodonts are known to become entangled and drown&#160; (Nishimura and Nishiwaki 1964, Julian and Beeson 1998, Waring <em>et al.</em> 2009). Entanglement of beaked whales has apparently been eliminated in drift gillnets off California through use of pingers (Carretta <em>et al.</em> 2008). However, gillnet use without pingers continues off Mexico and even low levels of bycatch could have a significant impact on this apparently rare mesoplodont.<br/><br/>In recent years, there has been increasing evidence that loud underwater sounds, such as active sonar and seismic operations, can be harmful to beaked whales (Cox <em>et al.</em> 2006). In particular, the use of active mid-frequency sonar from military vessels has been implicated in numerous strandings of beaked whales, including several <em>Mesoplodon</em> species (Balcomb and Claridge 2001, Wang and Yang 2006, D’Amico <em>et al</em>. 2009, Filadelfo <em>et al.</em> 2009). The exact cause of these strandings is often unknown, but some stranded individuals have been found to be suffering from chronic and acute tissue damage due to <em>in vivo</em> formation of gas bubbles, possibly resulting from decompression sickness linked to disturbance by naval sonar (Frantzis 1998, Jepson <em>et al.</em> 2003, Fernández <em>et al</em>. 2005). Given that a large fraction of the known distribution of Perrin’s Beaked Whale falls within US Navy testing ranges off California, this could represent the most significant threat to the species.<br/><br/>Ingestion of plastic in the ocean is a widespread and increasing problem, and possibly a significant cause of mortality of cetaceans, especially beaked whales, including mesoplodonts (Simmonds 2012, Fossi <em>et al</em>. 2018). Macroplastic items can physically block the digestive tract and lead to death (Secchi and Zarzur 1999), and microplastics (&lt;5 mm; Baulch and Perry 2014, Lusher <em>et al.</em> 2015) can leach toxic chemicals (Baini <em>et al.</em> 2017).<br/><br/>Organochlorine residues have been identified in other species of mesoplodonts (see Miyazaki <em>et al.</em> 1987) and they represent a potential health hazard of unknown significance to Perrin’s Beaked Whales.<br/><br/>Mesoplodonts are small whales that normally live far offshore; mortality from ship strikes would be difficult to document, but some possible cases have been reported (Dalebout <em>et al.</em> 2004, Waring <em>et al</em>. 2009).<br/><br/>Predicted effects of global climate change on the marine environment may have impacts on this species, although the nature of such impacts is unknown at this time (Learmonth <em>et al.</em> 2006).<br/><br/>Although none of the above factors may represent an existential threat to this species, the cumulative impact could account for the likely decline in this apparently very rare species.</p>","<p>There are no confirmed sightings of live Perrin’s Beaked Whales and no specific estimate of abundance. Regular ship surveys (approximately one every four years) were conducted in the area adjacent to all the known stranding sites for this species, from the coast out to 250-300 nm offshore, from 1991 to 2014, but hardly any of the mesoplodont sightings were identified to species. Pooling the data from these surveys, Barlow (2016) estimated the total abundance of <em>Mesoplodon</em> spp. where <em>M. perrini</em> is known to occur as 691 in the southern California stratum and 473 in the central California stratum. Strandings from the adjacent coastline suggest that at least six species of <em>Mesoplodon</em> could be included in these estimates:&#160;<em>M. carlhubbsi</em>, <em>M. perrini</em>, <em>M. peruvianus</em>, <em>M. densirostris</em>, <em>M. stejnegeri</em>, and <em>M. ginkgodens.</em> <em>Mesoplodon perrini </em>is the only species in this group that has not been recorded outside of the survey area. Therefore, the pooled estimate from these two strata (1,164, CV=0.49) provides an upper bound for the abundance of <em>M. perrini</em>.<br/><br/>An analysis of the abundance trend from 1991 to 2014 for <em>Mesoplodon</em> spp. in the entire survey area off the entire US west coast (between Canadian and Mexican border) yielded wide confidence limits (95% CRI -10 to +18% p.a.; Moore and Barlow 2017), with too few sightings to estimate the trend by stratum. Previously, Moore and Barlow (2013) had estimated, using data from 1991 to 2008, a trend of -8.4% p.a. (95% CRI -18.9 to +0.3% p.a.) and thus an almost certain decline. However, 2014 was an anomalously warm-water year (<em>e.g</em>. Bond <em>et al</em>. 2015), with many warm-water marine species being recorded far north of their usual ranges, including <em>M. densirostris</em> and <em>M. peruvianus</em>. Moore and Barlow (2017) hypothesize that the apparent increase in the abundance of <em>Mesoplodon</em> species in 2014 was likely caused by a shift in distribution of warmer-water species, <em>M. densirostris</em> and <em>M. peruvianus</em> which are also more common than the displaced <em>M. carlhubbsi</em> and <em>M. stejnegeri,</em> into the area rather than a real population increase. Therefore, the long-term trend of <em>M. perrini</em> cannot be quantified at this time, but a probable continuing decline is inferred from the threats documented below.</p>",Decreasing,"<p>The six specimens currently known to science all stranded between southern and central California (33–37°N). These are the five records reported by Dalebout <em>et al.</em> (2002) from southern California, and a stranding that occurred in Monterey, California in 1997. See the Supplementary Information for a map showing stranding locations. It appears that this species is endemic to the eastern North Pacific Ocean off the California coast in warm-temperate waters and probably south into Mexican waters. Initially, two sightings of mesoplodonts off California in the 1970s were tentatively identified as <em>M. hectori</em> (Mead 1981); it was later suggested that these were <em>M. perrini</em> (Dalebout <em>et al</em>. 2002), but there is no confirming evidence for either identification.<br/><br/>Acoustic data may provide additional information on the geographic range of <em>M. perrini.</em> A unique beaked whale echolocation pulse (called BW43) has been described from seafloor recording instruments off southern and central California up to 350 nmi offshore (Baumann-Pickering <em>et al.</em> 2014). Based on the restricted range of this sound which, at that time, did not extend beyond the suspected range of <em>M. perrini</em>, Baumann-Pickering <em>et al</em>. (2014) proposed that <em>M. perrini</em> was the most likely source of that sound. More recently, a study with drifting buoy recorders found a concentration of BW43 echolocation pulses off northern Baja California, Mexico (Simonis <em>et al.</em>, 2020). If the association between BW43 and <em>M. perrini</em> can be validated, the distribution of this species will be extended south to 29°N.<br/><br/>Given that this species is known only from a small number of strandings, its distribution can only be inferred; the distribution map displayed for this species is based on that produced by Macleod <em>et al.</em> (2006) and is the best available estimate of Perrin's Beaked Whale expected distribution.&#160; The map is coded as 'Incomplete', and the distribution coded as 'Possibly Extant' to reflect the lack of knowledge regarding Perrin's Beaked Whale distribution.&#160;&#160;</p>",,Marine,The species is listed in Appendix II of CITES.

Although sub-species level conservation management is warranted for many subpopulations, <em>Gasterosteus aculeatus </em>is globally listed as Least Concern.","This species is typically found in quiet weedy pools and backwaters. It is also found in the marginal vegetation of streams, over sand and mud bottom substrates. Marine populations are pelagic, and usually found inshore along the coast, in estuaries and coastal lagoons. In some lakes, two morphologically and ecologically distinct forms may occur, differing in habitat and morphology (one littoral, the other mainly limnetic) (Taylor 1999).&#160;<br/>The species can be anadromous, but there are numerous resident populations in brackish or pure freshwater. Anadromous populations forage at sea until two years old, then move to lower parts of rivers in March-April to reproduce (van Mullem and van der Vlugt 1964). Freshwater populations usually spawn for the first time at one year. In spawning season, males develop a bright orange to red belly and blue-green flank and eyes. They defend territories, in which in April-June they construct a nest on the bottom, in relatively shallow areas, very rarely attached to plants. They make a depression up to 14 × 10 cm to which they bring plant materials (especially filamentous algae), which are glued together with kidney secretions.&#160;Eggs are deposited in freshwater in a nest of plant material made by the male on the bottom in shallow water (Craig-Bennett 1931, Sargent and Gebler 1980). The female will typically lay a few hundred eggs and may lay eggs in several nests over a period of several days (Morrow 1980).<br/>Several females are individually led to the nest to spawn, then chased away. Males guard and fan eggs to provide them with oxygenated water. &#160;Eggs hatch in 7-8 days and juveniles are guarded for a few days after which the male abandons the nest. Anadromous individuals usually die of exhaustion after spawning, while freshwater individuals are able to complete several cycles within one year or sometimes over several years. Juveniles move to sea (anadromous populations) or to deeper, larger water bodies (freshwater populations) in July-August where they form large feeding schools (Symons 1971).&#160;<br/>They feed on small aquatic invertebrates, especially insects and crustaceans (Kuiter 2000).","No major widespread threats known.

Habitat degradation of eelgrass (<em>Zostera marina</em>) ecosystems, in which <em>S. leptorhynchus </em>spends much of its life, could produce future concern should habitat quality and quantity decrease.

It has also been documented over sand and pebble substrates (R. Pollom pers. ob.), and has been found between habitat patches, indicating mobility and dispersal between suitable habitat locations. <em>Zostera marina</em> is the most widely distributed seagrass throughout temperate waters in the Pacific (and Atlantic) oceans in the northern hemisphere.<br/><br/>This species can be used as an indicator species for monitoring eelgrass habitats because of its dependency on these habitats and its important role in the biomass (as a common resident) and functional ecology (as an important role in the production of organic detritus) of eelgrass beds (Fritzsche 1980, de Graaf 2006).<br/><br/>This species feeds on small crustaceans and other zooplankton. As with most other members of the Syngnathidae, <em>S. leptorhynchus </em>relies on stealth and camouflage to catch unsuspecting prey (Flammang <em>et al</em>. 2009). Several studies have reported parasites in these fish, including Gyrodactilids (Cone <em>et al</em>. 2013) and nematodes (Moravec <em>et al</em>. 2001), though it is not clear how prevalent they are, whether they are causing a decline in fitness, or how they affect <em>S. leptorhynchus </em>populations. <br/><br/>The reproductive strategy of <em>S. leptorhynchus </em>is polygyny, in which males mate with multiple females (Wilson 2009). The species lives 1-2 years, and can have up to 12 broods of several hundred young.","<em>Syngnathus leptorhynchus</em> is affected by habitat loss due to coastal development and sedimentation. There is suspected eelgrass loss across its range, significantly so in two of the coast’s largest estuaries, Puget Sound and San Francisco Bay, both home to <em>S. leptorhynchus </em>(Green and Short 2003). Eelgrass habitats are also naturally fragmented in distribution and have shown increasing fragmentation due to human activities. The fragmented nature of eelgrass habitat may affect local abundance and dispersal of <em>S. leptorhynchus</em>. Various studies have demonstrated declines in pipefish abundance with changes in water temperature, increased levels of pollution, and decreased area of eelgrass habitat (Fritzsche 1980, de Graaf 2006). In Barkley Sound, British Columbia, <em>S. leptorhynchus </em>was found to be absent or in low abundance in eelgrass habitats where visibility was reduced due to high levels of suspended sediments. Visibility is important for successful foraging as pipefish will sit and wait for passing prey. A decreased visibility will affect this success, and therefore this species is likely vulnerable to coastal land-use practices that increase erosion (de Graaf 2006).<br/><br/>In addition to these threats to eelgrass systems, an invasive species (<em>Zostera japonica</em>) has established itself throughout most of the range of <em>S. leptorhynchus</em>. Although not predicted to directly compete with native <em>Z. marina</em>, it's unclear whether the ecosystem shifts associated with this invasive seagrass will have effects on either <em>Z. marina </em>habitat cover or <em>Syngnathus leptorhynchus </em>populations (Harrison and Bigley 1982; J. B. Marliave, Vancouver Aquarium, pers. comm).<br/><br/>Overall, eelgrass habitat loss is not considered to be a large enough threat to <em>S. leptorhynchus </em>to warrant a threatened status, as Z. marina is currently listed as Least Concern itself (Short <em>et al</em>. 2010). The species is also capable of utilizing areas with pebble or cobble substrate, but more research into how the species uses different habitat types throughout its life cycle is needed.","<p>While exact population numbers for <em>Syngnathus leptorhynchus</em> are unknown, studies have reported the species as being locally common in some areas.

Size at 50% maturity is reported to be 514 mm total length for males, and 501 mm total length for females, however maturity varied by latitude in females with those at lower latitudes reaching maturity more quickly than those at higher latitudes. Although this catshark is reported to be a relatively common bycatch in deepwater trawl fisheries, insufficient catch and biological information are available to assess its extinction risk&#160; beyond Data Deficient. Species-specific monitoring of catches should be undertaken.","Brown Catshark is a little-known demersal and mid-water deepwater shark that occurs on the outer continental shelf and upper slope from depths of 33-1,298 m. It inhabits cold water (5-8°C), and thus tends to occur shallower in the northern parts of its range (i.e., 137-360 m off British Columbia; Castro 2011) and deeper in southern parts of its range (i.e., 656-932 m off southern California; Roedel 1951).<br/><br/>Reproduction is oviparous with a single egg at a time per oviduct and an incubation period of possibly two or more years (Flammang 2005). Egg cases are about 5 cm long and 2.5 cm wide, with long tendrils that are probably used to attach them to hard substrates and/or biogenic structures. Within the Monterey Bay Canyon possible nursery grounds were identified to be locations at the shelf-slope break, upper continental slope, high vertical relief with rugose substrate, and circulation water currents (Flammang <em>et al.</em>&#160;2011). In Canadian waters females carry egg cases from February to August, but are usually gravid in all months in the southern regions (Flammang <em>et al.</em> 2008, Ebert <em>et al.</em> 2013). Size at hatching is estimated to be 7 cm (Clemens and Wilby 1946). Size at 50% maturity is reported to be 514 mm total length (TL) in males, and 501 mm TL in females, however maturity varied by latitude in females with those at lower latitudes reaching maturity more quickly than those at higher latitudes (Flammang <em>et al.</em>&#160;2008).","Brown Catshark is commonly taken as bycatch in deepwater trawl fisheries.

Specific catch data are not available.<br/><br/>Trawl fisheries have operated between 20-2,000 m depth, which is throughout the depth range of this species. However, adults primarily inhabit areas of rocky vertical relief (mostly in depths of 300 to 600 m) which act as a natural refuge from trawl fisheries. This is also true for egg cases, which are often deposited in rocky environments. Egg cases of the Filetail Catshark are susceptible to predation by Thornyhead Rockfishes (<em>Sebastolobus</em>&#160;spp.), sea stars, and boring gastropods. The longline fisheries in the range of this species generally operate anywhere from 50 to 550 m. Longlines are laid over the rocky areas and are far more likely to catch adults of this species on a regular basis, as well as juveniles (which use the midwater area as a nursery). Purse seines targeting the market squid&#160;<em>Loligo opalescens </em>operate in midwater environments within the range of this species, and while they have the potential to impact the Filetail Catshark, there are no reports of bycatch of this species in this fishery.<br/><br/>In Mexico, artisanal trawl and gillnet fisheries did not encounter the Filetail Catshark when surveys were conducted in fishing communities along the coast of mainland Sonora from 1998 to 1999. The authors considered this species to be outside of the reach of these fisheries (Bizzarro <em>et al</em>. 2009a). However, little information is known and the situation in Mexico needs to be monitored.<br/><br/>In the United States, fishing pressure is thought to be unlikely to increase in the near future. Most of the trawling operations along the west coast of the United States are becoming more limited and are heavily restricted. As long as there are limits on rockfish fisheries, there will be limited groundfishing in these waters.","Nothing is known on the abundance or population structure of this species, but it is reported to be fairly common (Ebert 2003).

While there is a need for species-specific bycatch data from fisheries, catsharks are notoriously difficult to identify and misidentification is common.<br/><br/>On the United States west coast (Washington, Oregon and California), groundfisheries are managed by a federal Groundfish Fishery Management Plan. Although this species is not a focal species of the plan, and no species-specific on the Filetail Catshark will be collected, other&#160;chondrichthyans&#160;are being managed under this program. Additionally, in California, a network of 29 marine protected areas (MPAs) were implemented in 2007 under California's Marine Life Protection Act, representing approximately 204 square miles (~18%) of state waters in the central coast region (California Department of Fish and Wildlife 2015).&#160;Due to these MPAs, most trawlers are restricted to operating in deeper waters, and only in central and northern California. As a result, fishing effort in the California trawl fishery has been reduced, and catches of this species have also likely been reduced (D.

They appear to exhibit limited long distance movement, and as a result it is thought  that  the  population  consists  of  three regional population clusters in northern California, southern California and Mexico with limited genetic exchange.<br/><br/>In California,  where  nearly  all  of  the  U.S.  harvest  occurs,  the Leopard Shark  is  taken primarily  by  recreational  anglers,  although  it  is  also caught  incidentally  in  commercial fisheries. The species has also been harvested for the cold-water aquarium trade and has been highly prized for its distinctive markings and hardiness. Due to its rather limited geographical range and limited exchange among regional stocks, resident stocks near large population centres may be particularly vulnerable to heavy localized fishing pressure. However, this species does not appear to be at risk judging by the combined landings  in  relation  to  previously  calculated  estimates  of  fishing  mortality  and exploitation rates. Additionally, current conservation and regulatory actions enacted by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife appear to have reduced these rates and  have contributed significantly toward protecting this species  from excessive harvesting  in recent  years and there  is evidence that the leopard shark population  has been increasing as a result of these management actions.<br/><br/>Little is known of the biology, historical population abundance and full extent of harvest of this species in Mexican waters, but it is estimated to be less than one percent of the Pacific Ocean catch off Baja California and rarely caught in the Gulf of California. As a result of the success of the conservation measures taken in the U.S.  and  the  lack  of  a  significant  fishery  in  Mexican  waters,  this  species  is assessed as  Least  Concern.  However,  due  to  the  fact  that  this  species  is endemic to this region, is subjected to recreational fishing and bycatch pressures (albeit regulated in the U.S.), is susceptible to overfishing due to its life history characteristics (slow growing, long  lived,  late  maturing,  low  productivity), and  is impacted by habitat  loss  and degradation, it is important to continue managing and monitoring the species to ensure the health of the species.","Leopard Shark is a temperate shark of both inshore and offshore continental littoral waters, generally found on or near the bottom in shallow water from the intertidal to 20 m depth, although they have been found as deep as 156 m (Ebert 2003, Love 2011). This species is generally found over soft bottom habitats and around rocky reefs and kelp forests (Ebert 2003). Leopard sharks are relatively eurythermal and euryhaline species, but their distribution is known to be influenced by temperature, salinity, and dissolved oxygen levels (Hopkins and Cech 2003, Hight and Lowe 2007, Carlisle and Starr 2009, Dowd <em>et al.</em> 2010, Nosal <em>et al</em>. 2014).&#160;In their survey of Pacific coast estuaries, Emmet&#160;<em>et al</em>. (1991) reported that Leopard Shark of all age classes are commonly found in bays and estuaries between San Pedro Bay in Southern California and Humboldt Bay in Northern California, although they are particularly abundant in Elkhorn Slough, San Francisco Bay, Tomales Bay and Humboldt Bay. In southern California, they are known to form large aggregations in San Diego and the Channel Islands (Manley 1995, Hight and Lowe 2007, Nosal&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2013a, 2014).<br/><br/>Leopard Shark are seasonally abundant in bays and estuaries (such as Elkhorn Slough, Humboldt Bay, Tomales Bay, Bodega Bay, and San Francisco Bay) during the spring and summer, then during the winter they often move out of the bays to coastal waters as salinity and temperature decrease (Hopkins and Cech 2003, Carlisle and Starr 2009). In San Francisco Bay the population is mainly resident but about 10% move out of the bay in fall and winter (Smith and Abramson 1990). Leopard shark movements in bays and estuaries are strongly influenced by the tidal cycle. Leopard sharks will swim with tidal currents to reduce energetic costs associated with swimming as well as to facilitate foraging over a larger area (Ackerman <em>et al</em>. 2000, Carlisle <em>et al</em>. 2010). During incoming tides they move into shallow mudflats to forage and retreat to deeper water as the tide goes out (Ackerman <em>et al</em>. 2000, Carlisle and Starr 2009, Carlisle and Starr 2010). In exposed coastlines, tides have been shown to drive leopard shark movement between sand flats and rocky reefs (Nosal <em>et al.</em> 2013a). Leopard sharks have been reported to be more active at night (Manley 1995, Ackerman <em>et al</em>. 2000, Carlisle <em>et al</em>. 2010, Nosal <em>et al</em>. 2013a) as their rates of movement are generally higher at night. Manley (1995) reported that acoustically tagged leopard sharks at Santa Catalina Island, California, were more active at night, possibly related to foraging.<br/><br/>Leopard Shark appear to exhibit limited long distance movements, although they are capable of moving relatively large distances rapidly. One shark acoustically tagged at Catalina Island was detected seven days later along the mainland coast, a movement of approximately 105 km through deep water, after which it returned to Catalina Island (Hight and Lowe 2007). There have been several instances of sharks travelling ~100 km distance between Monterey Bay and San Francisco Bay and one shark tagged in San Francisco Bay was recaptured ~600 km away in Santa Monica Bay in southern California 10 years later, but in general, large scale movements appear to be limited (Smith 2001). This is supported by studies that have demonstrated that there is limited genetic exchange between Leopard Shark along different parts of the coast (Lewallen <em>et al</em>. 2007, Barker <em>et al</em>. 2015) and studies that have shown a high degree of site fidelity and potential natal philopatry, with many individuals consistently returning to particular locations (Lewallen <em>et al</em>. 2007, Carlisle and Starr 2009, Nosal <em>et al</em>. 2014, Barker <em>et al.</em>&#160;2015).<br/><br/>Leopard sharks are viviparous, without a yolk sac placenta, and the female produces from 7 to 36 offspring in an annual reproductive cycle. Gestation time is 10-12 months, and size at birth is 17 to 25 cm total length (TL; Ackerman 1971, Kusher <em>et al.</em> 1992, Smith 2001). Age at maturity for females is between 10 and 15 years and 105 to 135 cm TL. Males mature between 7 and 13 years and at 100 to 105 cm TL. The maximum size is 198 cm TL with reports of sharks up to 213 cm TL (Miller and Lea 1972, Feder <em>et al</em>. 1974, Kusher <em>et al</em>. 1992, Smith <em>et al</em>. 2003). Maximum age is at least 25 years, but is&#160;estimated  to  be about  30  years with an estimated generation time of 18.5 years (Cortes 2002).<br/><br/>Pregnant females are believed to exhibit behavioural thermoregulation and aggregate in shallow  warm  habitats,  likely  to  accelerate  embryonic  development  (Hight  and  Lowe 2007, Nosal <em>et al</em>. 2013a, 2014). Bays and estuaries appear to be important nursery areas, particularly in central and northern California. Reported nursery areas include Humboldt Bay, San Francisco Bay, Tomales Bay, Bodega Bay, Elkhorn Slough, San Diego Bay and Catalina Harbor (Eigenmann 1891, Bane and Bane 1971, Talent 1985, Smith 2001, Ebert 2003, Carlisle <em>et al</em>. 2007), although Emmet <em>et al</em>. (1991) also reported the presence of juveniles in Morro Bay, Santa Monica Bay, and San Pedro Bay. In central and northern California, parturition appears to occur from March through September, with a peak in April and May  (Ackerman 1971,  Talent  1985,  Smith  and Abramson  1990,  Ebert and Ebert 2005). In southern California pupping is believed to occur around May and June, although it has been reported to occur as late as September in San Diego Bay (Eigenmann 1891, Smith 2005).  Mating is believed to occur shortly after pupping (Ackerman 1971, Talent 1985, Ebert 2003) and has only been observed once in the wild, in the shallow surf zone in La Jolla (Smith 2005). Females may mate with multiple males with as many as 36% of litters having multiple paternity (Nosal <em>et al.</em> 2013b).<br/><br/>Females generally give birth in shallow protected habitats, often over sand or mudflats (Love 2011).  In central and northern California, neonates and juveniles are often found in more sheltered, shallow, inshore areas such as bays, mudflats, and tidal creeks (Barry and Cailliet 1983, Carlisle and Starr 2009). In Humboldt and San Francisco Bay, females have been observed releasing their young in beds of eel grass (Ebert 2003, Ebert and Ebert 2005). In southern California pupping and  nursery areas are generally thought to  be in the surf zone and sheltered coves of more open coast habitats (Smith 2001, Ebert 2003, Hight and Lowe 2007, Nosal et al. 2013).  Leopard sharks have been observed giving birth in Catalina Harbor over sandy bottom in water as shallow as 1 m, with pups found in water only 0.3 m deep (Smith 2001).","Leopard Sharks appear to be primarily caught in Californian waters. The commercial and recreational catch of leopard sharks in the extreme northerly part of its range in Oregon is thought to be negligible (Emmett <em>et al</em>. 1991, Pacific Fisheries Information Network (<a href=""http://pacfin.psmfc.org"">PacFIN</a>), Recreational Fisheries Information Network (<a href=""http://www.recfin.org/"">RecFIN</a>)).<br/><br/>In California, where nearly all of the U.S. harvest occurs, the leopard shark is taken primarily by recreational anglers. The recreational leopard shark catch is much more extensive than the commercial catch for this species. Leopard sharks have been recreationally harvested by angling with baited hooks from piers, jetties, beaches, banks and skiffs, bow fishing in shallow waters, and spearfishing by divers. Estimated recreational landings in California between 1980 and 1995, for years when data were collected, averaged over 138 metric tons (mt) annually. After a peak in 1987 of around 546 mt, recreational landings declined and from the mid 1990’s to 2006 remained relatively lower and stable at around 46 mt (<a href=""http://pacfin.psmfc.org"">PacFIN</a>, Smith and Horeczko 2006). Since 2006, recreational catch has decreased from prior levels (<a href=""http://www.recfin.org/"">RecFIN</a>).<br/><br/>Commercially, leopard sharks are taken incidentally in gillnet, longline and trawl fisheries although there is a small targeted hook-and-line fishery in San Francisco Bay (Smith and Horeczko 2006). A problem exists in accurately judging the extent of the commercial harvest because an unknown portion of the commercial catch may be landed under the general category ‘shark, unspecified’ and different species are often marketed under the generic name “shark.” California commercial landings specifically reported under the ‘Leopard Shark' category are relatively minor, and have ranged from 4.2 mt in 1958 to a high of 46 mt in 1983. Catches declined after 1983 and from the mid 1990’s to 2007 remained relatively low and stable, at around 11.4 mt. Landings dropped after 2008 and have remained low at around 2.3 mt per year since (http://pacfin.psmfc.org).&#160; Curtailment of inshore gillnetting probably contributed greatly to the decline in California landings. The species has also been harvested for the cold-water aquarium trade and is highly prized for its distinctive markings and hardiness (Smith and Horeczko 2006).<br/><br/>Loss and alteration of habitat, especially in coastal bays and estuaries, is of great concern for this species, given the importance of these areas for foraging and as nursery sites (Carlisle and Starr 2009). Water quality in bays and estuaries is of potential concern as well. For example, Elkhorn Slough, an important foraging and nursery area for this species, has experienced severe nutrient loading from surrounding agricultural areas, resulting in eutrophication and hypoxic conditions, which impact habitat and prey availability (Hughes et al. 2013). This is a potential problem as there is evidence that dissolved oxygen levels may influence habitat availability of this species (Carlisle and Starr 2009). Leopard sharks have also been shown to have significant concentrations of contaminants in their tissues, but the impact of this on their fitness remains unknown (Schaffer <em>et al</em>. 2006, Carlisle <em>et al</em>. 2007).<br/><br/>Resident stocks near large population centres may be particularly vulnerable to heavy localized fishing pressure due to the limited exchange among regional stocks (Smith and Abramson 1990, Lewallen <em>et al</em>. 2007, Barker <em>et al</em>. 2015). Even though the commercial catch may be under-estimated because of reporting problems, this species does not appear to be at risk judging by the combined landings in relation to previously calculated estimates of fishing mortality (mean F=0.084) and exploitation rates (mean E=0.075; Smith and Abramson 1990). Additionally, current fisheries management measures appear to have reduced these rates.<br/><br/>Poaching of pups for the aquarium trade has been a significant problem. In 2006, several individuals were arrested for illegally harvesting Leopard Shark pups for the aquarium trade. Investigators estimated that between 20,000 to 25,000 pups were poached from San Francisco Bay and 30,000 to 33,000 pups were poached from southern California between 1992 and 2003. This level of harvest is quite large when compared to recreational and commercial fishery Leopard Shark landings, with potentially important ramifications to Leopard Shark populations (Smith and Horeczko 2006).<br/><br/>Little is known of the biology and full extent of harvest of this species in Mexican waters, but it is estimated that less than one percent of the catch off the Pacific coast of Baja California is comprised of this species (Cartamil <em>et al</em>. 2011) and most of the shark catch in the central Gulf of California fishery is comprised of other, larger species (e.g., <em>Alopias</em> and <em>Carcharhinus</em> spp.; Bizzarro <em>et al</em>. 2009). However, the historical abundance of Leopard Sharks in this region is also unknown.","It is thought that the Leopard Shark population consists  of  regional stocks with limited connectivity (Smith  and  Abramson  1990,  Lewallen  <em>et  al</em>. 2007).  Lewallen  <em>et  al</em>.  (2007) reported that there were seven subpopulations between Humboldt Bay and San Diego, with the Humboldt Bay population of leopard sharks being the most genetically distinct from  the  rest  of  the  more  southerly  distributed  populations.  They  also  found  some evidence of natal philopatry, which they suggest may be in part what drives the observed genetic structure. More recently, a genetic study of Leopard Shark from sample locations ranging from northern California to Mexico showed that distinct populations exist in northern California, southern California and Mexico (Barker <em>et al</em>. 2015). Within Mexican waters, the Pacific coast and Gulf of California stocks may be distinct populations (Smith 2001).",Unknown,"This is one of the most common nearshore sharks along the west coast of North America (Ebert 2003). In U.S. waters, the leopard shark is most abundant along the coast of California.&#160;Leopard Shark&#160;is endemic to the Northeast Pacific Ocean, ranging from Samish Bay, Washington to Mazatlan, Mexico, including the Gulf of California.&#160;In Oregon waters, Emmett&#160;<em>et al</em>.

They are also found along the open coast (Nosal <em>et al.</em> 2013a, 2014) and around offshore islands, such as the  Channel Islands in southern California (Manley 1995, Ebert, 2003, Hight and Lowe 2007).",This species is collected and traded for aquariums.,Marine,"In 1990, tagging and other life history data were used to estimate fishing mortality, yield, and stock replenishment rates to determine the degree of vulnerability to fishing pressure for Leopard Shark (Smith and Abramson 1990). Researchers indicated that, given the amount of fishing pressure exerted in the 1980s and that leopard sharks are more susceptible to overexploitation than previously thought, some measure of protection was necessary to assure replenishment of the population (Cailliet 1992, Au and Smith 1997), especially considering that they are caught in both commercial and recreational fisheries and considered to be a desirable food fish.<br/><br/>The leopard shark is one of the many species that has been considered, but is not now actively regulated, under  the  Pacific  Fishery  Management  Council’s  Groundfish  Management  Plan. Regulatory  actions  enacted  by  the California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) &#160;have  contributed  significantly  toward protecting  this  species.  In  1991,  efforts  increased  to  protect  the  leopard  shark  in California, and late that year California established new sport fishing regulations which took effect on 1 January 1992, establishing a 36 inch (91 cm) minimum size and a daily bag limit of three fish. The recreational fishing sector not only strongly supported the move, but also did much to promote it. Effective 1 January 1993, an 18 inch (45.7 cm) minimum size limit was extended to the commercial fishery for Leopard Shark and all sharks and rays, to prevent over-harvesting for the aquarium trade.&#160; <br/><br/>Additionally, California has general restrictions on usage of certain types of commercial gear (in  particular  gillnets) in  the  near  shore  zone,  which  offers  a  good  degree  of protection  for  the Leopard Shark.  CDFW’s  imposition  of  recreational  and  commercial fishing  regulations  appears  to  have  halted  the  increase,  if  not  reduced, &#160;total  fishing mortality over the past decade (Smith <em>et al</em>. 1998).

This species inhabits the outer continental shelf and upper slopes and occurs at depths between 15-1,602 m. It is taken as bycatch in commercial trawl and longline fisheries, operating in the upper part of its bathymetric distribution. Biomass estimates from scientific surveys suggest that biomass may have increased in the eastern Bering Sea in recent years. Few time series data are available for other areas of its range. Given that the Aleutian Skate appears to be more abundant in deeper waters, outside the range of current fishing pressure, and in the absence of any evidence to suggest significant declines, it is assessed as Least Concern. However, few species-specific data are available and increasing interest in skate fisheries within this species’ range is of concern. Aleutian Skates exhibit limiting life-history characteristics, similar to other large skate species and may be susceptible to overfishing, should a directed fishery develop. Species-specific monitoring is required to determine catch levels and trends.

These results suggest that it is a relatively productive skate species and less vulnerable to population declines compared to <em>B. trachura</em> for example (Barnett <em>et al</em>. 2013). This analysis did not estimate population growth rates for the species in different regions (i.e. EBS or GOA), thus it is not possible to determine if the species has differences in vulnerability across its range.

Therefore this species’ deep bathymetric distribution may offer refuge, outside the range of current fisheries.

On the EBS shelf, the Aleutian Skate is a much smaller proportion of the skate biomass and in most years with reliable species identification, their survey biomass varies between 1,000 and 6,000 t, except in 2003 when it was estimated at 18,000 t (Ormseth and Matta 2012). In the Aleutian Islands (AI), the Aleutian Skate abundance varied between 3,000 and 11,000 t from 2000 to 2012 (Ormseth and Matta 2012).

It is believed that adult females migrate to deeper spawning grounds once or twice a year, and skates migrate to shallower waters as they develop (Orlov <em>et al</em>. 2006). The species occurs at a range of temperatures, but is most frequently found at bottom temperatures of 2.5-4.0°C, and at depths below 400m (Stevenson 2004, Orlov <em>et al</em>. 2006).</p>  <p><span lang=""EN-GB"">In the eastern Bering Sea, the Whitebrow Skate reaches 35 years for males and 37 years for females (Ainsley <em>et al</em>. 2011).

Fisheries in which skates are caught include the hook and line cod fishery, where the Whitebrow Skate is most commonly caught, and trawl fisheries for Pollock, rock sole, and flathead sole. The capture probability for Alaskan skates in a survey trawl was calculated to be 84.6%, with larger fish having a greater probability of being caught (Kotwicki and Weinberg 2005). Skate egg case habitats are also harmed by trawl and dredge fisheries. Skate bycatch has increased in the past few years in some of the deeper fisheries (Ormseth 2014a).

It is a medium-large species (maximum length 135 cm). With a maximum observed age of 20 and age at maturity between 7-10 years, it has a life history that is perhaps less vulnerable than other longer-lived skate species. However, its shallow depth distribution makes it more susceptible to fishing activity. Population information is available throughout the eastern Bering Sea and the Gulf of Alaska for this species, where it is&#160;regularly taken as bycatch in commercial trawl, gillnet and longline fisheries. Research survey data suggest that&#160;this skate is highly abundant on the continental shelf of the eastern Bering Sea, and biomass has either been stable or increasing from the 1980s to 2013 in the eastern Bering Sea shelf and slope, and in the Aleutian Islands. This species is less common in the Gulf of Alaska, where biomass has been relatively stable, but no reliable trend data are available. This species is managed with annual catch limits determined using an age-structured model in Alaska, which indicates that the abundance of the Alaska Skate&#160;is much greater than the biological reference point associated with an overfished status. In waters of the&#160;western Bering Sea and the northern Sea of Okhotsk catches are unknown but fishing pressure is considered to be relatively low.

Maximum reported depth in Alaska is 392 m (Stevenson <em>et al.</em> 2007), but in the BSAI region it is rarely found below 300 m (Ormseth 2014a). This skate&#160;is found on sandy-gravel, muddy-pebble and sandy-muddy substrates and at bottom temperatures of -1.0–6.8°C (most common between 3.0 and 3.5°C) (Dolganov 1998a, Orlov&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;2006). Nursery areas are known in the north, central and south eastern Bering Sea shelf (Hoff 2007).&#160;<span lang=""EN-GB"">On the EBS shelf it is ubiquitous, although the spatial distribution varies with age.

This species utilizes small, discrete areas on the upper slope (145-380 m depth) as nursery areas where they deposit embryos in eggcases. The embryos develop inside the eggcases for approximately 3.5 years before emerging as free-swimming individuals. Several of these nursery sites have been mapped. Habitat requirements for the nursery areas are unknown, but may include stable temperatures and availability of sufficient oxygen.&#160;</p>  <span lang=""EN-GB"">This </span><span lang=""EN-GB"">medium-large skate, has a maximum observed length of 135 cm total length (TL; Stevenson et al 2007). Females reach maturity at 8–10 years and 80.9–95.4 cm TL and males at 7–9 years and 79.5–93 cm TL (Dolganov 1998b, Ebert 2005, Gaichas&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;2006, Matta and Gunnderson 2007).&#160;The maximum age is reported to be 20 years (Matta and Gunderson 2009).&#160;Research on this species in captivity showed that embryo development exceeds 3.5 years and size at birth is 22.4 cm TL (Hoff 2007). Reproduction peaked during summer months and during winter months peaks in hatching occurred (Hoff 2007). Natural mortality is estimated at 0.13 (Matta and Gunderson 2009, Ormseth 2014a).&#160;These data, as well as the results of population modelling, suggest that although the Alaska Skate have a late-maturing and therefore vulnerable life history, they are perhaps not as vulnerable as other longer-lived skate species.","Commercial fishing is most likely the main threat to this deepwater skate. The majority of the population is found above 200 m and occurs within the depth range of gillnet, trawl and longline fisheries (A. Orlov pers. comm. 2007 and Matta&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2006), and trawling also affects the species’ nursery grounds on the eastern Bering Sea shelf by removing egg cases (Hoff 2007). The Alaska Skate is regularly taken as bycatch in commercial trawl and longline fisheries in the Bering Sea Aleutian Islands (BSAI) region, particularly on the EBS shelf and upper parts of the EBS slope. Although catches are high (26,060 t estimated in 2014), they are well below the overfishing level (OFL) of 39,833<span style=""""> t (Ormseth 2014a). In addition, spawning biomass in 2015 was projected to be 115,490 t, well above the biomass maximum sustainable yield (BMSY) proxy of 65,423 t&#160;(i.e. B35%). Skates are often retained, with the rate of retention depending on skate size and market interest. In 2013 the overall retention rate for skates in the EBS was 29% (Ormseth 2014a). Since at least the early 2000s there has been int</span>erest in directed fisheries for skates in the GOA, mainly for the Longnose Skate (<em>Raja rhina</em>) and the Big Skate (<em>Beringraja binoculata</em>). Such fisheries occurred in federal waters in 2003 and 2004, and in state waters in 2009 and 2010, but&#160;<em>Bathyraja</em>&#160;species constituted only a small proportion of the catch of this fishery (Ormseth and Matta 2007). Although directed fishing for skates is currently prohibited, there has been interest in developing markets for skates in Alaska and continued interest in skates as a potential future target in the Gulf of Alaska, Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands is expected (Ormseth and Matta 2007).&#160;<br/>The catch of the Alaska Skate in the western Bering Sea (WBS) is unknown; however a recent assessment of the conservation status of chondrichthyans in Russian waters determined that the IUCN status of this species&#160;in Russia was “Least Concern” (Grigorov and Orlov 2013). Deepwater bottom trawl and longline fisheries are conducted in the northern Sea of Okhotsk, western and eastern Kamchatka, western Bering Sea and northern Kuril Islands but the fishing pressure is relatively low. There are few deepwater fisheries activities in the southern and western Sea of Okhotsk, off Commander and southern Kuril Islands. Unlike many other skate species, the relatively shallow depth distribution of this skate makes them vulnerable to commercial fishing. Development of directed fisheries for skates should be closely monitored as this has the potential to threaten the status of the Alaska Skate.<p><span lang=""EN-GB"">Other threats are unknown. Altered ocean conditions resulting from climate change are likely to affect this skate, but the nature of that threat cannot be determined at this time.&#160;</p>","In Alaska, population information for the Alaska Skate&#160;is available from trawl surveys and population modelling conducted by the U.S. National Marine Fisheries Service. On the EBS shelf this skate&#160;in particular&#160;is exceptionally abundant, comprising approximately 95% of the skate biomass.&#160;Total biomass on the EBS shelf in recent years&#160;has remained stable at around 300-500,000 tonnes (t) between 1999-2013, and total skate biomass was estimated to have undergone a dramatic increase from&#160;from 106,535 t in 1983 to 371,004 t in 1989&#160;(Ormseth 2014a).&#160;Although skates were not identified to species during this period, the dominance of&#160;the Alaska Skate&#160;on the shelf suggests that the increase occurred within the&#160;Alaska Skate&#160;population. Population modelling indicates that this increase is consistent with a period of large year classes (i.e. increased recruitment) in the late 1970s and early 1980s (Ormseth 2014a). Since 1990 the population on the EBS shelf has fluctuated somewhat but appears to be essentially stable.&#160;<br/>This skate also occurs regularly on the EBS slope (19, 829 t in 2012), and in the AI (3,515 t in 2014; Ormseth 2014a). Although biomass trends for the Alaska Skate are considered to be stable in the EBS shelf, EBS slope, and AI, it is noted that the available timeseries are too short for proper evaluation (Ormseth 2014a). In the AI the population may have declined slightly since 2010, but analysis of trends is complicated by the identification of a new species and by the high survey coefficient of variation (CV; Ormseth 2014a, Ormseth 2014b). In the Gulf of Alaska, this species&#160;is far less common than in the EBS and AI. Estimates from bottom trawl surveys suggest that the Alaska Skate biomass has generally increased in the western and central GOA from 1984-2013 (Ormseth 2014b), but these data are not considered reliable enough to establish trends for this species in the GOA.&#160;<br/>In Russian waters,&#160;data from bottom trawl surveys (at depths of 50–2,000 m) estimated that the biomass of this species was 273,600 t including 45,100 t in the Bering Sea, 11,500 t off Kamchatka and Kuril Islands, 211,700 t in the Sea of Okhotsk, and 5,300 t in the Sea of Japan from 1977–1997 (Dolganov 1999). In Pacific waters of the northern Kuril Islands and southeastern Kamchatka (just off the Sea of Okhotsk), bottom trawl survey (conducted at depths of 100–850 m) catches increased from 1 kg/hr in 1993 to 2.5 kg/hr in 1998, followed by a decrease to 0.7 kg/hr in 2000 (Orlov <em>et al.&#160;</em>2006).",Unknown,"<span lang=""EN-GB"">The Alaska Skate&#160;<span lang=""EN-GB"">is distributed throughout the northern North Pacific Ocean, from the Japanese island of Hokkaido to the eastern Gulf of Alaska (GOA; Mecklenburg <em>et al</em>. 2002, Stevenson <em>et al.</em> 2007). In the mid-2000s the Leopard Skate (<em>Bathyraja panthera</em>), previously thought to be simply a colour morph of <em>B. parmifera</em>, was established as a separate but closely related species (Stevenson <em>et al.</em> 2007, Orr <em>et al.&#160;</em>2011, Ormseth 2014a). This species is only known in the western Aleutian Islands (AI), west of Amchitka Pass (Orr <em>et al</em>. 2011). In Alaskan waters the Alaska Skate&#160;is most abundant on the continental shelf of the eastern Bering Sea (EBS). The reported depth range is 17-1,425 m (Mecklenburg <em>et al</em>. 2002, Stevenson <em>et al</em>. 2007), but in Alaska&#160;this species&#160;is generally not found below 392 m (Stevenson <em>et al</em>. 2007).

Regardless of the method of determination, the specifications are combined so that there is a single set of specifications for the entire complex. Prior to 2011, skates were managed as part of an “Other Species” complex that included animals with widely disparate life history types including octopus, sharks, sculpins, and skates (Ormseth 2014a,b). In the GOA, this skate is managed as part of an “other skates” complex with harvest specifications based on survey biomass estimates.

It has also been reported in the Sea of Okhotsk, Russia, but this may actually be a different species. It is one of the deepest living skate species, occurring to nearly 3,000 m depth, beyond the reach of most trawl operations.

The expansion of the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary in 2009 to include the Davidson Seamount also offers protection to this species, as it is known to inhabit these waters. Given that this skate lives in deep and rocky habitat that is largely outside of the reach and interest of current fisheries, and that it is rarely captured, Pacific White Skate is assessed as Least Concern.

Length at first maturity is 47.4 cm TL and 9 years for females; and for males length at maturity is 46.0 cm TL and age is 6 years (James 2011). Length at 50% maturity is 63.2 cm TL and age is 11.2 years for females and 60.3 cm TL and 11.5 years for males (James 2011). At 100% maturity, length is ≥69.2 cm TL and age is 15 years for females, and length is ≥65.8 cm TL and ≥13 years for males (James 2011). Females reach a maximum TL of 76.1 cm and a maximum age of 15 years, and males reach a maximum TL of 71.7 cm and a maximum age of 14 years (Ebert 2003, James 2011, James <em>et al</em>. 2014). James et al. (2014) estimated maximum age to be between 11 and 15 years, as their results varied depending on the ageing method used (gross vs. histological sections). Growth was best described by a two parameter von Bertalanffy growth function, where L∞= 91.5 cm TL and k= 0.013 year-1 (James <em>et al</em>. 2014).

This species that appears to be abundant throughout the core of its range from British Columbia, Canada to Puget Sound, Washington, USA. One of the best-studied of all chimaeroid fishes, life history studies indicate that this species is very fecund, producing 20-29 eggs per year. This species is not targeted by fisheries, but it is taken as bycatch in commercial trawl and longline fisheries and rarely retained. Fisheries-independent surveys of Spotted Ratfish along the west coast of the United States suggest that this species is stable or increasing throughout this area. Given the broad distribution of this species, generally high abundance, recent increases in population size, and evidence to suggest that the population can recover from substantial bycatch, this species is assessed as Least Concern.<br/></p>","Spotted Ratfish are most common over soft-bottom or cobble habitats and around rocky reefs (Ebert 2003). They have been observed as shallow as the sea surface in some inshore waters (Dean 1906), but generally occur at depths to 913 m on the open coast (Alverson <em>et al</em>. 1964) and are most abundant on the outer shelf and upper continental slope (Barnett et al. 2012). The species also occurs into the intertidal zone in the northern parts of its range (Dean 1906). Their bathymetric distribution is shallower at higher latitudes (Dean 1906, Barnett <em>et al</em>. 2012). Although their movements are not understood in detail, they do seem to display vertical and alongshore migrations within inlets protected from the open coast (Mathews 1975, Quinn <em>et al</em>. 1980, Andrews and Quinn 2012). Populations appear to segregate by sex and size (Mathews 1975, Quinn <em>et al</em>. 1980, Barnett <em>et al</em>. 2012), with dense aggregations of juveniles and egg cases observed around offshore banks near the shelf break (Barnett <em>et al</em>. 2012).<br/><br/>This species is oviparous with peak reproductive period from late spring to fall (Barnett <em>et al</em>. 2009a). Egg cases are laid in pairs at a rate of approximately once per 17-19 days and extrapolating this over the 6-8 month reproductive season provides an estimated annual fecundity of approximately 20-29 eggs/year (Barnett <em>et al</em>. 2009a). The incubation period within the egg case is about 12 months, with newborns emerging at about 14 cm total length (TL) (Didier and Rosenberger 2002). Size at maturity for the population on the U.S. west coast is 19 cm snout-vent length (SVL) for females and 15-16 cm SVL for males. Maximum sizes for the population on the U.S. west coast are 63 cm TL for females and 50 cm TL for males. Both size at maturity and maximum size increase with latitude, and historical estimates of maximum size of the species were much greater than reported here (97 cm TL; Miller and Lea 1972). It seems unlikely that the species can be reliably aged (Johnson and Horton 1972, Barnett <em>et al</em>. 2009b). Indeed no robust estimates of generation length are available for any <em>Hydrolagus</em> spp.","<p>There is no directed fishery for Spotted Ratfish.

From 1977 to 1995 CPUE was stable, and from 1995 to 2006 CPUE increased (Barnett <em>et al</em>. 2012). Increases in Spotted Ratfish populations were particularly pronounced from 1998 onwards along the northern region of the US west coast shelf and upper slope, and increases were not observed in the southern shelf and upper slope, perhaps because of climate (a strong El Niño cycle) and differences in fishing pressure (Barnett <em>et al</em>. 2012). <br/></p>",Increasing,"<p>                   </p><p>Spotted Ratfish is widespread along the western coast of North America from southern Alaska (Wilimovsky 1954) to Baja and the Gulf of California (Ebert 2003), being most abundant in the inshore waters of British Columbia, Canada and Puget Sound, Washington, USA (Palsson 2002, Palsson <em>et al</em>. 2004), along with the coastal waters off northern and southern California, USA (Barnett <em>et al</em>. 2012).

There is no directed fishing for skates in the GOA or BSAI, however interest in retention of skates and directed fishing for skates remains high (Ormseth 2014a).

It is occasionally caught as bycatch in eastern Bering Sea trawl fisheries at depths shallower than 200 m. The species is also caught and retained by bottom trawl fisheries targeting groundfish in Russian waters at depths shallower than 600 m. These fisheries only impact the species over the shallower part of its bathymetric range, and this species appears to be more abundant in the deeper waters of its range, which are outside of the range of current fishing pressure.<br/><br/>The majority of the species’ extent of occurrence is thought to lie outside the range of current fisheries. Relative biomass indices in the Eastern Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands suggest that the biomass of this species has remained stable since 2002, while the relative biomass index calculated off Kamchatka for 1993-2000 showed a dramatic increase in biomass for Mud Skate. However, these data were gathered over short time periods making trends unreliable, species-specific data are limited, and an increasing interest in skate fisheries within this species’ range is of concern. Mud Skate exhibits limiting life-history characteristics, similar to other skate species and may be susceptible to overfishing, should a directed fishery develop.<br/><br/>Given that this species is not targeted, that current data suggest that biomass is stable, and that this species appears to be more abundant in deep water outside of the reach of current fisheries, it is assessed as Least Concern. Species-specific monitoring is required to determine catch levels and trends, and if fisheries expand further across this species’ range, or if a long-term target fishery were to develop, then this assessment should be revisited.","Based on survey reports, the mud skate has been observed at shallower depths in the Aleutian Islands than other areas, 488 m, however, this may be a factor of survey depths (Stevenson <em>et al</em>. 2008). It prefers bottom temperatures from -0.2–3.56°C (mean 2.56°C) with most skates occurring between 3–3.5°C (Dolganov 1998a, Orlov <em>et al</em>. 2006). Dolganov (1998a) found most skates on sandy-gravel (49.8 % of occurrence), sludgy-pebbly (35.4%), and sandy (14.8%) substrates.<br/><br/>Mud Skate inhabits outer shelves and upper continental slopes within the depth range 81–1,000 m (Sheiko and Fedorov 2000). The majority of the population occurs between 250–500 m, with larger animals inhabiting deeper ranges (Orlov <em>et al</em>. 2006). Median size at maturity is attained at 61.4 cm total length (TL) and 58.0 cm TL, for females and males respectively; corresponding to a median age at maturity of 9.1 years for females and 9.6 years for males (Ebert <em>et al</em>. 2009). Maximum size is 77 cm TL (Ebert 2005) and longevity is 14 years (Ebert <em>et al</em>. 2009). Demographic analyses indicated that of the five Bering Sea skate species, Mud Skate was the most productive due to highest predicted population growth rate and shortest generation time (Barnett <em>et al</em>. 2013).","<p>Mud Skate is taken as bycatch in demersal trawl fisheries operating within its range. It is quite commonly captured by bottom trawl fisheries targeting groundfishes (Pacific Cod, Pollock, rockfishes, Atka Mackerel, flatfishes, etc.) but it is not taken in large numbers. These fisheries only operate in the upper part of its bathymetric range in the EBS and AI (&lt;200 m). Fisheries in Russian waters operate in waters that are &lt;600 m deep, which overlaps with the species distribution in this area. However, the catch rates are likely low and the species has a refuge in deeper waters, particularly in the EBS and AI (D. Ebert and A. Orlov pers. obs. 2007).<br/></p>","This species is one of the ten most abundant skate species in Russian waters. According to bottom trawl survey data (1977–1999) the total biomass of Mud Skate in the Russian waters comprised 17,400 t including 14,500 t in the Bering Sea and 2,900 t off Kamchatka and Kuril Islands (Dolganov 1999). In the eastern Bering Sea (EBS) and Aleutian Islands (AI), this species is one of the less common species (Ormseth 2014). A biomass index based on three surveys in the EBS and AI estimated a relative biomass of 2,405 t in 2012. In the AI, a 2014 survey estimated a relative biomass of 1,831 t (Ormseth 2014).<br/><br/>Relative biomass indices in the EBS and AI appear stable since 2002, ranging from 2,122 t to 2,706 t (Ormseth 2014). In the AI, indices range from 885 t to 2,971 t (Ormseth 2014). Mud Skate is &lt;1% of the observed fishery catch of all skates in the EBS and AI areas since 2004 and total skate catch has averaged 22,300 t since 2004 (ranging from 17,918 t in 2010 to 27,260 t in 2013; Stevenson and Lewis 2010, Ormseth 2014). Relative biomass indices were calculated off Kamchatka for 1993-2000 and showed a dramatic increase in 1999 and 2000 (Orlov <em>et al</em>. 2006).",Stable,"<p>The Mud Skate is found in the eastern and western North Pacific Ocean.

Mud Skate are present in the Aleutian and Kuril Islands and along the Pacific coast of Kamchatka, Russia, and are most common in the 250-300 m depth range (Dolganov 1999, Stevenson 2004, Orlov <em>et al</em>. 2006).<br/></p>",This species is not utilized.,Marine,"<p>There are no conservation measures in place for this species.

In California and the Gulf of Alaska, big skates reach about 250 cm TL and live to about 15 years, whereas in British Columbia they can grow up to 290 TL cm and live to 26 years. It is important to note that age estimates are based on an unvalidated method and geographic differences in size or age may reflect differences in sampling or ageing criteria. Age and size at maturity also differs between regions. In the Gulf of Alaska, females big skates reach 50% maturity at 150 cm TL (10 years) and at 120 cm TL (7 years) for males (Gburski <em>et al</em>. 2007, Ebert <em>et al</em>. 2008). In British Columbia, females reach 50% maturity at 90 cm TL (8 years) and at 72 cm TL (6 years) for males (McFarlane and King 2006). The Big Skate is oviparous and deposits egg cases on the sea floor that have embryos that develop in 6 to 20 months, depending on water temperature (Hoff 2007). Fecundity estimates are difficult to obtain because the Big Skate is one of only two skates to have more than one embryo per egg case. Aquarium observations have shown that the most common number of embryos per egg case is two (Chiquillo<em> et al</em>. 2014), but the range is from 1 to 7 (DeLacy and Chapman 1935, Hitz 1964). The number of egg cases that can be produced per female each year is uncertain, but observations in aquaria indicate that females can deposit over 350 egg cases per year (Ebert <em>et al</em>. 2008).

From such coastal rivers this species is known to ascend to spawn, and when at sea, this species ranges from the surface to depths of 100m. This species is also known from Newfoundland, the St. Lawrence River and Nova Scotia, southward to central Florida. This species has been historically targeted in commercial fisheries that has been known to result in dramatic declines in population. There is concern over habitat quality and the effect that riverine, damns and estuarine impediment have on spawning success of this species. In recognition of the species declines across its range, the at-sea fishery for this species was closed, and subsequent landings from the ocean are only from the bycatch fishery. In addition,&#160;<em>Alosa sapidissima</em> is presently managed under Amendment Three of the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission (ASMFC) American Shad Fishery Management Plan, only allowing for catch and release via hook and line only, for states without an approved sustainable fishing plan. The purpose of this sustainable fishing plan for Massachusetts is to allow continuation of fishing, while planning for population restoration within rivers where populations are low and others where information is limited.Given that this species is so widely distributed and has shown some recovery and improvements in population abundance in parts of its range thanks to conservation efforts, this species is assessed as Least Concern.","<em>Alosa sapidissima</em> is a pelagic, coastal, migratory, and anadromous species, that utilizes riverine habitats for spawning purposes. Individuals reach sexual maturity at approximately 4-5 years (Whitehead 1985). Larvae spend their initial 3 to 4 months in riverine-nursery areas during the summer and migrate out to sea by autumn. Juveniles form schools at 20-30 mm TL and gradually move downstream (Jones, et al., 1978). Premigratory juveniles are habitat generalists, whereas earlier life stages and spawning adults are more selective (Ross et al. 1993).&#160;<br/><br/>Adults occur in marine waters except during the breeding season, spending the majority of their life at sea, returning to freshwater streams to breed (Morrow, 1980). Non-spawning adults are found in schools near the surface of continental shelf waters in spring, summer and autumn, also found in brackish waters (Hildebrand, 1964).Adults feed primarily on plankton and copepods (Whitehead 1985).&#160;<em>Alosa sapidissima</em>&#160;grows to a maximum standard length of 60 cm (average length of 50 cm) (Whitehead 1985).<br/><br/>Spawning occurs in various habitats such as runs in rivers, as far as 480 km upstream, but this however is now commonly obstructed by dams. This species first spawns at 4-5 years, feeding mainly on plankton and copepods and mysids, occasionally on small fishes, with feeding ceasing during upstream spawning migration and resumes during the downstream, post-spawning migration (Scott and Crossman, 1998).","Historical and more recent declines in abundance of <em>Alosa sapidissima</em>, throughout its range, have been attributed to over-fishing, pollution, and habitat loss from the construction of multiple dams and other riverine impediments (Haas-Castro 2006, ASMFC 2007).&#160;There have been multiple 'fish lifts' constructed at numerous damns now present within rivers occupied by <em>Alosa sapidissima</em>, but some are closed due to high water levels, contradicting the aid to this species (Sheppard and Chase, 2012) and many are not efficient for upstream passage (Sprankle, 2005).","Little population information is available for this species, however in recent years, declines have occurred throughout its range.&#160;American shad landings between the years 1990-2010, display an annual rate of decline of -4.506, monitored by the NMFS Fisheries Statistic and Economic Division, Northeast Regional Office (Sheppard and Chase, 2012). Similar monitoring is required for the previous ten years to provide accurate information on the species current status. In some rivers, restoration efforts led to increases in population abundance, from the low levels observed in 2007 within Pawcatuck and Connecticut Rivers, Rhode Island, the Potomoc River, Virginia, and the Santee River, South Carolina (ASMFC 2007, 2009).

The construction of fish elevators and ladders around dams have also been implemented to help recover the spawning pathways for this species, otherwise blocked or isolated by dams (Brown and St Pierre 2001). However, an example of the low level of upstream passage efficiency is at of the Pawtucket Dam in Lowell. Between 1989 and 2009 it was found on average only 29% of fish that pass through the Essex Dam fish lift will ascend the lift at the Pawtucket Dam (Sheppard and Chase, 2012). Sprankle (2005) assessed passage efficiency at the Lowell Dam and found 66% of the <em>Alosa sapidissima</em> at the Essex Dam arrived at the pool downstream of the Lowell Dam, and 55% entered the dam tailrace, but only 4% entering the tailrace passed the Lowell Dam fish lift. No ripe shad have been caught below the Essex Dam during electrofishing monitoring, indicating that no spawning habitat occurs below the dam and all fish were seeking to move upstream (Sprankle, 2005; Sheppard and Chase 2012).",Nearctic,,false,false,Global

It is primarily a warm-water species that migrates toward temperate or cold waters for feeding in the summer and back to warm waters in winter for spawning and overwintering. Adults are opportunistic feeders, known to forage for their food from the surface to the bottom over a wide depth range (Nakamura 1985). Swordfish typically forage in deep water during the day and stay in the mixed layer at night (Abascal <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2010). Based on records of forage organisms taken by swordfish, its depth distribution in the northwestern Pacific ranges normally from the surface to a depth of about 550 m but there are depth records down 2,878 m.<br/><br/>This species uses its sword to kill prey. It feeds mainly on fishes but also on crustaceans and squids. Large individuals may accumulate high concentrations of mercury in the flesh (Collette 1995).<br/><br/>The distribution of larval swordfish in the Pacific Ocean indicates that spawning occurs mainly in waters with a temperature of 24°C or more. Spawning appears to occur in all seasons in equatorial waters, but is restricted to spring and summer at higher latitudes (Nishikawa and Ueyanagi 1974). In the Atlantic Ocean, spawning occurs in the upper water layer at depths between 0–75 m, at temperatures around 23°C, and salinity of 33.8–37.4 ppt. Pairing of solitary males and females is thought to occur when spawning (Palko <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 1981). Spawning in southern Brazil occurs from November to February in between 20–28°S and 40–47°W (Amorim and Arfelli 1980). Estimates of egg numbers vary considerably, from one million to 16 million in 168,000 g female (Palko <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 1981) and 29 million in a 272,000 g female (Wilson 1984).<br/><br/>Determination of age is difficult since the otoliths are very small and scales are missing in adults.

Major sport fishery areas, trolling, and drifted baited lines are located off the coast of California to Ecuador, Peru and northern Chile (Nakamura 1985). In the Mediterranean Sea, it is mostly caught by drift nets, long lines, but also by harpoons, tuna traps and sport and recreational fisheries. It is a good food fish, marketed fresh or frozen.<br/><br/>The largest proportion of Atlantic catches are made using surface drifting longlines, mostly by Spain, United States, Canada and Portugal. However, many additional gears are used (STECF 2009). Other directed swordfish fisheries include fleets from Brazil, Morocco, Namibia, EC-Portugal, South Africa, Uruguay, and Venezuela. The primary by-catch or opportunistic fisheries that take swordfish are tuna fleets from Chinese Taipei, Japan, Korea and EC-France. The tuna longline fishery started in 1956 and has operated throughout the Atlantic since then, with substantial catches of swordfish that are produced as a bycatch of tuna fisheries (ICCAT 2009). In the Atlantic, the Mediterranean stock is considered to be overfished and that overfishing is occurring. The stocks of the North and South Atlantic are considered to be well-managed (ICCAT 2009).<br/><br/>In the Indo-Pacific the main fisheries are Japan and Taiwan. Taiwan has had stable standardized CPUE trends, and Japan has shown variable CPUE trends depending on the fishing area (IOTC 2009). The Indian Ocean, Western Central Pacific and Southeastern Pacific are similarly considered to be under adequate management at present (fishing mortality below Fmsy and biomass above Bmsy; Kolody <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2008, IOTC 2009, Hinton and Maunder 2006).","The Atlantic population is comprised of three stocks that are genetically distinct: South Atlantic, North Atlantic and Mediterranean. The best scientific evidence indicates that there are four stocks of Swordfish in the Pacific Ocean (Hinton and Alvarado Bremer 2007), with centres in the northwest, northeast, southwest, and southeast. The Indian Ocean population is currently assessed as a single management unit.<br/><br/>The North Atlantic stock of Swordfish is not overfished and overfishing is not occurring (ICCAT 2009). The stock is rebuilding with current biomass levels increasing by 4.4% over a three generation length period based on the ASPIC base case (Figure 20, ICCAT 2009). The reduction was calculated using the first and last data points of the time series considered. The stock is considered to be under adequate management.<br/><br/>The South Atlantic stock was overfished and overfishing had been occurring, but at present, fishing mortality is below FMSY, stock biomass is slightly above BMSY and under current management quotas (13,700 t TAC), the stock is projected to remain above the BMSY and slightly rebuild further (ICCAT 2009). The reduction in biomass for the South Atlantic stock over three generations has been approximately 30.3% based on the ASPIC base case (Figure 30, ICCAT 2009). The reduction was calculated using the first and last data points of the time series considered. The stock is considered to be under adequate management.<br/><br/>The Mediterranean stock is currently considered to be overfished and stock is experiencing slight overfishing. The International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas Standing Committee on Research and Statistics (ICCAT-SCRS) report that the Mediterranean Sea swordfish compose a unique stock separated from the Atlantic, although more research is needed to clearly define the stock boundaries. Mitochondrial DNA restriction analysis reveal that genetic differentiation occurs between populations inhabiting the Mediterranean Sea and the tropical Atlantic ocean, indicating little genetic exchange occurring between the two (Kotoulas <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 1995). The spawning stock biomass (SSB) in 2008 was 46% below the value that would maximize yield-per-recruit. In addition, the majority of the catch includes juveniles. However, landings statistics and population parameters indicate a certain stability over the past 20 years. The estimated decline in total biomass over a three generation period (20 years) ranged from 27–50% depending on whether a regression line or first and last points of the data series were used (Figure 21, ICCAT 2010). The Mediterranean population of Swordfish was therefore regionally assessed as Near Threatened in an overview of the conservation status of Mediterranean fishes (Abdul Malak <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2011). This stock is not considered to be well-managed.<br/><br/>In the North Pacific, a two-stock scenario analysing the western and central Pacific (subarea 1) and the eastern Pacific (subarea 2) was considered the most plausible based on analyses of Japanese longline catch per unit data (CPUE) data. Using the two-stock Bayesian production model (Brodziak and Ishimura 2009), a decline of 43.9% was estimated for subarea 1, and an increase of 111.2% in subarea 2 over a three generation length period (20 years). The decline was calculated using a linear regression over the time period considered. The results indicate that the North Pacific population is stable (Brodziak and Ishimura 2010).<br/><br/>In the Western Central Pacific, a MULTIFAN-CL stock assessment of south-west Pacific Swordfish showed a decline in total biomass ranging from 25.7% (optimistic scenario) to 36.9% (pessimistic scenario) over three generation lengths (20 years) (Figure 29, Kolody <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2008). The reduction was calculated using the first and last data points of the time series considered. The stock is considered to be under adequate management.<br/><br/>In the Southeastern Pacific, spawning biomass is estimated to have increased by 3.3% over three generation lengths (Figure 4.4, Hinton and Maunder 2006). The percent change was calculated using a linear regression over the time period considered. The stock is considered to be under adequate management.<br/><br/>For the Indian Ocean, an ASPIC model showed a decline in total biomass of 57.8% over the last three generation lengths (20 years) (Figure 59, IOTC 2010). The reduction was calculated using the first and last data points of the time series considered. The model results indicate that biomass is close to the BMSY level, and that overfishing is not presently occurring. The stock is considered to be under adequate management.<br/><br/>Globally, this species has shown a 28% decline over three generation lengths (20 years). The only stock that is not considered to be well-managed is the Mediterranean, which comprises less than 10% of the species' global range.<br/><span style=""font-weight: bold;""></span>",Decreasing,"This species is pandemic, and is found in the Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific oceans in tropical, temperate and sometimes cold waters, including the Mediterranean Sea, the Sea of Marmara, the Black Sea, and the Sea of Azov.<br/><br/>Mitochondrial DNA restriction analysis reveal that genetic differentiation occurs between populations inhabiting the Mediterranean Sea and the tropical Atlantic Ocean, indicating little genetic exchange occurring between the two (Kotoulas <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 1995).<br/><br/>In the Eastern Pacific, this species ranges from southern California and the mouth of the Gulf of California to Chile, including all of the offshore islands.",This species is of high commercial importance (see Threats section).,Marine,"This is a highly migratory species, listed in Annex I of the 1982 Convention on the Law of the Sea (FAO Fisheries Department 1994).<br/><br/><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Atlantic</span><br/>There have been some changes in U.S. regulations which may have impacted catch rates, but the effects of these remain unknown. It is important to note that since 2003 the catches have been below the total allowable catches (TACs), greatly increasing chances of a fast recovery (STECF 2009). The total allowable catch in the North Atlantic during the 2007–2008 period was 14,000 t per year. The reported catch during that period averaged 11,536 t and did not exceed the TAC in any year. The total allowable catch in the South Atlantic for the years 2007 through 2008 was 17,000 t. The reported catch during that period averaged 13,365, and did not exceed the TAC in any year. There are two minimum size options that are applied to the entire Atlantic: 125 cm LJFL with a 15% tolerance, or 119 cm LJFL with zero tolerance and evaluation of the discards.<br/><br/><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">North Atlantic</span><br/>Since 1994 there have been quotas and minimum size limits to restrict the harvest of north Atlantic Swordfish. There are also longline area closures in place in the U.S. Atlantic. Reduced landings have been attributed to the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT) regulatory recommendations and shifts in fleet distributions, including the movement of some vessels some years to the South Atlantic or out of the Atlantic. In addition, some fleets, including the United States, EC-Spain, EC-Portugal and Canada, have changed operating procedures to opportunistically target tuna and/or sharks, taking advantage of market conditions and higher relative catch rates of these species previously considered as by-catch in some fleets. Recently, socio-economic factors may have also contributed to the decline in catch. Consistent with the goal of the Commission’s swordfish rebuilding plan (Rec. 96-02), in order to maintain the northern Atlantic Swordfish stock at a level that could produce maximum sustainable yield (MSY) with greater than 50% probability, the Committee recommends reducing catch limits allowed by Rec. 06-02 (15,345 t) to no more than 13,700 t. This reflects the current best estimate of maximum yield that could be harvested from the population under existing environmental and fishery conditions. Should the Commission wish to have greater assurance that future biomass would be at or above BMSY while maintaining F at or below FMSY, the Commission should select a lower annual TAC, depending on the degree of precaution the Commission chooses to apply in management. The Committee noted that allowable catch levels agreed in (Recs. 06-02 and 08-02) exceeded scientific recommendations. The successful rebuilding of this stock could have been compromised if recent catches had been higher than realized. Because of the poor size-selectivity of longliners, regulating minimum landing size may inadvertently have resulted in under-reporting of juvenile catches. Alternative methods for reducing juvenile catches, such as time and/or area closures or technological changes in gear deployment, may be more effective and their utility should be further investigated (STECF 2009). Future TACs above MSY are projected to result in 50% or lower probabilities of the stock biomass remaining above BMSY over the next decade (SWO-ATL-Figure 13) as the resulting probability of F exceeding FMSY for these scenarios would trend above 50% over time. A TAC of 13,000 t would provide approximately a 75% probability of maintaining the stock at a level consistent with the Convention Objective over the next decade (ICCAT 2009).<br/><br/><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">South Atlantic</span> <br/>Until more research has been conducted to reduce the high uncertainty in stock status evaluations for the southern Atlantic swordfish stock, the Committee emphasizes that annual catch should not exceed the provisionally estimated MSY (15,000). Considering the unquantified uncertainties and the conflicting indications for the stock, the Committee recommends a more precautionary Fishery Management approach, to limit catches to the recent average level (~15,000 t), which are expected to maintain the catch rates at about their current level (STECF 2009). In general, catches of 14,000 t or less will result in increases in the biomass of the stock, catches on the order of 15,000 will maintain the biomass of the stock at approximately stable levels during the period projected. Catches in the order of 16,000 t or more will result in biomass decrease. The current TAC is 17,000 t (ICCAT 2009).<br/><br/><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Mediterranean Sea</span><br/>In the Mediterranean Sea, there are minimum size regulations, such as 90cm lower jaw-fork length in Spain, 140 upper jaw fork-length in Italy, 130 UJFL in Turkey. However, these minimum size regulations were cancelled because it was considered ineffective as a management tool. In Greece, the fishing season is closed from October to January. In 2009, ICCAT adopted a closed season for the Mediterranean Sea from 1 October to 31 November. The EU has banned all drift nets since January 2002 and ICCAT banned them since 2005 (some illegal drift nets still occur).<br/><br/><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Pacific</span><br/>In Chile there is a size limit for this species, and total effort for this species has declined as they moved from driftnets to longlines. However, recent catches in this region are mostly targeted by the Spanish fleet. Given the potential for rapid change in the nature of the gill-net and longline fisheries that are increasingly targeting swordfish in the Eastern Pacific region, the trends in standardized catch per unit effort should be closely monitored for indications of changing status of these stocks (Hinton 2003, Hinton and Maunder 2006). The Western Central Pacific Fisheries Commission has recommended to limit the number of boats as well as catch and effort for the southwestern stock (WCPFC 2008).<br/><br/><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Indian</span><br/>The Scientific Committee recommends that management measures focused on controlling and/or reducing effort in the fishery targeting Swordfish in the southwest Indian Ocean be implemented (IOTC 2006).","",,false,false,Global
97667070,190422,Mola mola,Vulnerable,A4bd,2015,2011-06-07 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<p>This species is widely distributed. It is targeted by fishers in the western Pacific and south Atlantic and is captured in large numbers as bycatch in fisheries using long lines, drift gillnets and midwater trawls in a number of widely distributed fisheries. In some fisheries, the catch of <em>Mola mola</em> exceeds that of the target species. Preliminary calculations from three of these fisheries (two South African longline fisheries, and the USA Southwest Region drift net fishery), indicate 300, 26,000 and 340,000 individual <em>M. mola</em> per fishery are made each year and it is likely that other fisheries using these same methods are taking large, but unreported, bycatch of <em>M. mola</em> throughout the majority of its range. In some areas, substantial declines (up to 100%) have been documented, likely driven by the high bycatch. Based on these declines and the likelihood that this species is experiencing high rates of bycatch throughout most of its range, we suspect this species is declining globally by at least 30% over three generation lengths (24-30 years) that includes both the past and the future. Therefore, this species is listed as Vulnerable under A4bd. Future monitoring and research on its basic biological variables such as age at maturity, generation time, etc. is recommended.<br/></p>","<em>Mola mola&#160;</em>is an oceanodromous, pelagic-oceanic species that occurs in subtropical waters between depths of 30 and 480 m, but is usually between 30 and 70 m (Powell 2001, Riede 2004, Allen and Erdmann 2012). Adults are found on slopes adjacent to deep water where they come in for shelter and to seek out cleaner fishes (Kuiter and Tonozuka 2001). It&#160;is an active swimmer capable of highly directional movements and horizontal movements independent of the current (Cartamil and Lowe 2004); it&#160;uses its anal and dorsal fins as a pair of wings (Pope&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span>&#160;2010).&#160;It feeds on fishes, molluscs, zooplankton, jellyfish, crustaceans, and brittle stars (Clemens and Wilby 1961, Scott and Scott 1988, Kuiter and Tonozuka 2001). Cartamil and Lowe (2004) observed a diel pattern in depth&#160;utilization, with fish residing in the warmer mixed layer above or within the thermocline at night and repeatedly diving beneath the thermocline into cooler water during the day (Californian waters, July-September 2001). Hays<span style=""font-style: italic;""> et al. </span>(2009) also noted that although individual sunfish showed a range of preferred depth that altered over time, they were still moving up and down the water column and regularly returning to close to the surface. Although its exact function has yet to be resolved, Cartamil and Lowe (2004) proposed that periodic returns to the surface in <span style=""font-style: italic;"">M. mola</span> may imply some form of behavioural thermo-regulation i.e. prolonged time in cold waters necessitates time spent at the surface to re-warm. This may explain the frequent observations of ocean sunfish observed 'basking' or swimming on their sides at the surface during the day (Cartamil and Lowe 2004). Conversely, Sims <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> (2009a) argued that extensive vertical movements may simply reflect a crepuscular searching strategy when prey are descending or ascending, with sunfish attempting to locate maximum prey abundances at this time. It has been also been suggested more generally that large amplitude dives or ascents of large pelagic fish and other vertebrates during prey tracking may represent prey searching behaviour (Shepard <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>2006)&#160;characterized&#160;by extensive movements to new locations (Sims<span style=""font-style: italic;""> et al. </span>2008).&#160;It exhibits sexual dimorphism; females are larger than males (Pope<em>&#160;et al</em>. 2010).&#160;<br/>Maximum total length is 333 cm (Claro 1994); maximum published weight is 2.3 t (Roach 2003); all animals larger than 250 cm TL are female (Nakatsubo 2008).&#160;Very few studies have been conducted on the reproductive biology of ocean sunfish (Pope <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2010). In Japan,the spawning period&#160;is estimated between August and October and the same study also identified asynchronous egg development, suggesting it is a multiple spawner (Nakatsubo <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>2007).&#160;The lifespan or reproductive age of <span style=""font-style: italic;"">M. mola</span> under natural conditions is unknown, although captive animals have been maintained for more than 8 years (Nakatsubo <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2007). A growth curve derived from repeated measurements of captive specimens estimated an individual with a total length of 3 m would be about 20 years old (Nakatsubo 2008). Recent work used growth band pairs in vertebrae to age the closely related sharptail mola <span style=""font-style: italic;"">M. lanceolatus</span> caught in the eastern Taiwan fishery (Liu <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2009). The age estimates ranged between &gt;2 and &gt;23 years for females and &gt;1 and &gt;16 years for males (Liu <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2009). &#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Mola mola</span> is famously the most fecund of all vertebrates (Carwardine 1995) with a 137 cm female containing an estimated 300 million eggs (Schmidt 1921). By necessity, these eggs are very small (mean diameter 0.13 cm; Gudger 1936) and so <em>M. mola</em> growth is staggering. For the 0.25 cm larva to grow to a 3 m adult requires an increase in mass of 60 million times (Gudger 1936). A more atypical captive growth rates have been found to be between 0.02 and 0.49 kg/day in weight (M. Howard and T. Nakatsubo pers. comm. in Pope <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>2010) and on average 0.1 cm/day TL (Nakatsubo and Hirose 2007).<br/><br/>Longevity is estimated at between 20 and 23 years old; using a maximum age based estimator with low prediction error (M = 4.899t<sup>−0.916</sup>: Then and Hoenig 2014), the estimated adult natural mortality rate is 0.28-0.32. Age at first maturity is unknown, but inferred to be between 5 and 7 years (based on the smallest reported ripe female of 137 cm and assuming a linear growth rate to 3 m at 22 years old). Using the estimator for generation length of 1/adult mortality + age at first reproduction results in a generation length of 8-10 years, and thus a time window for calculating population declines of 24-30 years.","Ocean sunfish populations may be vulnerable to fishing activity because of the high levels of bycatch observed in many fisheries, including&#160;long lines, drift gillnets and midwater trawls&#160;(Silvani <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 1999, Cartamil and Lowe 2004, Fulling <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2007, Petersen and McDonell 2007).&#160;In South Africa, mid-water trawl fishery of the Cape horse mackerel&#160; (<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Trachurus trachurus capensis</span>)  caught predominantly large individuals and observed a significant  decline in ocean sunfish catch rates between 2000 to 2003, with other  bycatch species remaining comparatively stable (Petersen and McDonell  2007). Bycatch estimates from the Californian swordfish fishery suggest  ocean sunfish make up 29% of all bycatch; far outnumbering the target  species (Cartamil and Lowe 2004).&#160;<em>Mola mola</em> is targeted by fishers in the western Pacific and south Atlantic.&#160;<em>Mola mola</em>  is also captured in large numbers as bycatch in a number of widely  distributed fisheries.","This species is a common resident of the offshore waters of the northwestern Atlantic during the spring and summer months, with an estimated summer abundance of 18,000 (Kenney 1996 in Potter <em>et al.</em> 2011). Large aggregations of small (&lt;1 m TL)&#160;<em>Mola mola</em> have been observed in coastal waters (Pope <em>et al. </em>2010,&#160;Syväranta <em>et al.</em> 2012). In Irish and Celtic Seas, a total of 68&#160;were spotted from 2003-2005, or an overall density of 0.98 sunfish per 100 km²<sup></sup> (Houghton<em> et al.</em> 2006).&#160;According to reports from the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) Southwest Region, between 1990 and 1998, 26.1% of the drift net catch consisted of <em>M. mola</em>. This translates to a catch of more than 26,000 individuals (Rand Rasmussen, NMFS Southwest Fisheries Science Center, pers. comm. in Dewar <em>et al. </em>2010). Off the coast of South Africa, <em>M. mola</em>&#160;bycatch rates from the tuna and swordfish longline fishery are estimated at 340,000 sunfish annually (Petersen 2005, Sims <em>et al.</em> 2009).<br/><br/>Although estimates of population size are generally lacking, there is evidence of local population declines over short time scales.&#160;In Namibia,&#160;<em>Mola mola&#160;</em>showed a peak of catch landings in 2006 (40 metric tonnes), then decreased with only 7 metric tonnes in 2007 (FAO 2014); while CPUE was not available, this represents a decline of 82.5%. Landings have recently been reported from Argentina and are likely to increase (FAO 2014). In Ireland, there was been a decline of about 100% (13 to 0 metric tonnes) in 2 years (2000-2002). There was also a decline in Portugal from 12 metric tonnes in 1999 to about 0 in 2009 (FAO 2014).<br/><br/>Based on localized declines that exceed 80% and the likelihood that this species is experiencing high rates of bycatch throughout most of its range, we suspect this species is declining globally by at least 30% over 3 generation lengths (24-30 years) that includes both the past and the future.",Decreasing,"<em>Mola mola&#160;</em>is circumglobally distributed throughout warm and temperate zones of all oceans. In the eastern Pacific it is known from Canada (British Columbia), south to Peru and Chile (Chirichigno 1974,&#160;Eschmeyer&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1983). In the Indo-Pacific it is known throughout the Indian Ocean including the Red Sea, from Russia and Japan to Australia and New Zealand, and the Hawaiian Islands (Muus 1964, Smith 1965, Ayling and Cox 1982, Sims and Southall 2002, Cartamil and Lowe 2004, Houghton&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2006, Konow&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2006,&#160;Todd and Grove 2010).&#160;It is considered a waif in the Persian Gulf.&#160;In the eastern Atlantic it is known from Scandinavia to South Africa (and occasionally in the western Baltic, North,&#160;and Mediterranean Seas). In the western Atlantic it is known from Canada (Newfoundland) south to Argentina including the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean Sea (Robins and Ray 1986,&#160;Figueiredo and Menezes 2000).&#160;Its depth range is 0-400 m (Cartamil and Lowe 2004).","<em>Mola mola</em> is not a commercially important fish (Fulling&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2007, Silvani&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;1999), although there is some market for it in Japan (Sagara and Ozawa 2002, Watanabe and Sato 2008) and Taiwan (20.8-49.4 tonnes per annum, Liu&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2009).&#160;It is targeted by fishers in the western Pacific and south Atlantic. This species<em>&#160;</em>is also captured in large numbers as bycatch in long line, drift gillnet and midwater trawl&#160;fisheries. For example, the South African longline fishery for tuna and swordfish was estimated to have annually caught between 0.08 and 0.29 sunfish for every 1,000 hooks set (1.6-2.7 million hooks per year) in the 4 years between 2000 and 2003 (Petersen 2005). Furthermore,&#160;it&#160;was by far the most common bycatch species in the Cape horse mackerel (<em>Trachurus trachurus capensis</em>) midwater trawl fishery in the same region (Petersen and McDonell 2007), representing 51% of the total bycatch between 2002 and 2005 (Petersen and McDonell 2007). Similarly,&#160;<em>M. mola</em>&#160;comprised between 70 and 93% of the total fish catch in Spanish drift gillnet fisheries within the Mediterranean between 1992 and 1994 (Silvani&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1999); bycatch estimates from the Californian swordfish fishery suggest ocean sunfish make up 29% of all bycatch, far outnumbering the target species (Cartamil and Lowe 2004). A crude calculation using values from a recent study of the Moroccan fleet (Tudela&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2005) suggests an annual bycatch of 36,450 ocean sunfish. Whilst the majority of&#160;<em>M. mola</em>&#160;are returned to the water alive (Silvani&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1999), they often show varying levels of trauma (Cartamil and Lowe 2004) and post-catch survival data are lacking.&#160;<br/>There is little or no fishing effort likely to affect this species in the Gulf of Mexico (H.

Archaeologically, subpopulations were abundant throughout its range despite natural fluctuations; however, more recently (1900’s) this species has exhibited erratic, and at times, catastrophic declines, possibly caused by heavy industrial exploitation during the early 20<sup>th</sup> century combined with natural causes like food availability and climatic changes. Overall, currently available (~ 2000 – present) global population information for this species is extremely variable. Some regions within its distribution (e.g., northeast Pacific: Alaska, British Columbia, Washington, Oregon, California) have long time series data available (e.g., spawning stock biomass estimates, landings data, etc.), while other regions (e.g., northwest Pacific: Japan, Russia, Korea, China) have little to no current information available. Within some areas where data are available, spawning stock biomass (SSB) estimates suggest rapid fluctuations (e.g., Alaska, California, Canada, etc.); however, these estimates are spatially and temporally asynchronous. For example, in some localities (e.g., Prince William Sound, Alaska; Cherry Point, Washington; West Coast Vancouver Island, British Columbia) SSB estimates decreased by up to 77 % in the most recent 15 years available (thought to conservatively represent three generation lengths for this species). However, in other neighboring localities (e.g., Sitka Sound, Alaska; Quilcene Bay, Washington), SSB estimates have increased by up to 400 % in the most recent 15 years available. Given the inconsistencies in the trends of available data within and between regions (including temporal differences in biological characteristics such as maximum age and age at first maturity), we are unable to extrapolate trends in SSB across the entire global population.</p>  <p>The prominent threat to this species is likely a changing climate which can impact food availability for each of several life history stages (larvae, juveniles and adults), spawning distribution and recruitment within local stocks. Additionally, climatic changes can also impact the distribution of major predators (e.g., birds, pinnipeds and other fishes) which can have widespread ecological and fishery effects. Furthermore, there is evidence suggesting that disease can significantly affect recruitment especially as a consequence of anthropogenic impacts, though more research is needed. In general, this species is also exploited to a varying degree throughout a large portion of its global range. It is regarded as the second most important targeted species in the northwest Pacific; it is one of the few important commercial species targeted in Russian Far East territory and has been taken in industrial trawl fisheries since the early 1900s. However, little current information on the status of this species in this region is available. In the eastern Pacific, this species is targeted at varying intensities in the purse seine and gill net fisheries for food, bait and sac roe exploitation. Throughout its range, it likely also contributes small quantities to bycatch in trawl, seine and longline industrial fisheries that target other important species such as Alaska pollock, cod and various flatfishes. Given the commercial importance of this species, fisheries management regulations have been implemented within its range, such as yearly fishery closures and stock-specific management plans including yearly stock assessments, catch quotas, harvest rates, and biomass reference points. In some areas, (e.g., Sitka Sound, Alaska) herring have responded to management measures. However, it has not proven to respond well to management and conservation measures in other localities where it has experienced major declines in abundance, even after periods of long-term fisheries closures in some cases (e.g., Cherry Point, Washington, Yellow Sea, Hokkaido-Sakhalin). This may further suggest that natural changes are possibly preventing the recovery of this species in these areas. </p>  <p>In general, the status of this species within the southernmost portions of its range (e.g., within the Yellow Sea and off coastal Japan in the western Pacific and off the continental U.S. in the eastern Pacific, including California, Oregon and Washington) is of concern. Sea surface temperatures are expected to continue to increase in these areas as a result of global climate change, potentially leading to a northward contraction of its range into cooler waters. It is known that the spawning distribution of this species changes naturally throughout its range in response to local abundance and environmental conditions; some areas observe new spawning localities or renewed spawning in previously known localities, while other areas observe a cessation or contraction in known spawning localities leading to the concern of the possible depletion of local stocks. More research is needed to determine whether changes are due to fishing pressure or a natural shift in distribution.</p>  <p>In light of the major commercial importance of this species, marked declines in some places and increases in others, and major data gaps in large regions of its range where it is known to be exploited (e.g., current/recent status in Japan and Russia), assessing the overall status of this species globally as per the IUCN Red List Criteria is not possible, and therefore <em>Clupea pallasii</em> is assessed as Data Deficient. If and when information becomes available where it currently is not, this species should be immediately be reassessed. Furthermore, due to the variations in life history characteristics, exploitation level and biomass trends, sub-global assessments for this species are urgently needed. </p>","<p><em>Clupea pallasii </em>is a pelagic-neritic schooling species that mainly occupies the deeper waters of coastal shelf regions to about 300 – 400 metres at maximum. Herring move inshore to breed in high-energy, shallow intertidal and subtidal habitats from about November to July (Whitehead 1985, Haegele and Schweigert 1985, Hay <em>et al. </em>2001a, Hay <em>et al. </em>2009). Spawning takes place once a year (Hay <em>et al. </em>2001a) in many localities throughout its global range. Pacific herring are late winter and spring spawners (Hay <em>et al.</em> 2001a) with peak spawning events occurring later in the spring at progressively higher latitudes (Haegele and Schweigert 1985). For example, in the eastern Pacific, spawning takes place from November to March in California, February to April in British Columbia, and from March to June off south and north Alaska, respectively (Haegele and Schweigert 1985, Hay <em>et al. </em>2001a). Age at maturity varies geographically from 1 – 4 years of age (Hay <em>et al. </em>2001a). During mass spawning events, females deposit adhesive eggs directly on the bottom, on vegetative substrata such as seagrasses and seaweeds, rocky intertidal areas or man-made structures (e.g., pier pilings, rip rap: Blaxter 1985, Haegele and Schweigert 1985, Hay <em>et al. </em><em>2001a, </em>2009, Shirafuji <em>et al. </em>2018).&#160; After spawning, individuals generally migrate back to foraging grounds in deeper water (Hay <em>et al. </em>2001a). Similar to age at maturity and spawning time, there is latitudinal variability in other biological factors including, maximum size, longevity and migration patterns. For example, compared to herring within the eastern Bering Sea, Gulf of Alaska herring reach a smaller maximum size overall, have a shorter maximum longevity, more frequent recruitment events (every four years compared to every ten years in the eastern Bering Sea) and do not undergo large migrations (Hay <em>et al. </em>2001a). In general, schools consist of individuals of similar size/age such that juveniles do not mix with larger juveniles or adults (Hay <em>et al. </em>2001a). This species is known to a maximum standard length of 33 cm (Whitehead 1985), though there are records of this species with a total length of 46 cm (Coad and Reist 2004). Maximum longevity varies from 7 – 15 years (Hay <em>et al. </em>2001a). Adult herring are known to exhibit extensive diel vertical migrations where they are deeper in the water column by day and shallower during the night (Hay <em>et al. </em>2001a). Herring diets vary but they mainly consume zooplankton; larvae consume copepod eggs, nauplii and young stages of other organisms, juveniles mainly consume copepods and adults predominately feed on copepods and euphausiids (Wailes 1936, Hay <em>et al. </em>2001a). Long-term cyclic changes in size-at-age of Alaskan herring have been correlated to zooplankton abundance and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), though direct causes are not known (Hay <em>et al. </em>2001a). It is possible that subpopulations elsewhere (e.g., Hokkaido – Sakhalin, Yellow Sea) are impacted by food availability and climatic variation as well, though more research is needed. </p><em> </em>","<p><em>Clupea pallasii</em>&#160;is heavily fished throughout a large portion of its global range and has shown considerable population fluctuations with dramatically reduced abundance levels in parts of its range (see summaries in: Ware 1991, Hay <em>et al. </em>2001a, Yeon <em>et al. </em>2008, Canadian Science Advisory Secretariat 2009, Schweigert <em>et al</em>. 2010, FAO 2016, WDFW 2018<em>a</em>). Archaeological evidence indicates that this species exhibited natural fluctuations; however, over the last century, some subpopulations have exhibited erratic, and at times, catastrophic declines (McKechnie <em>et al.</em> 2014). It is possible that drastic declines stemmed from natural causes; however, excessive industrial harvesting is suggested to be a likely reason for differences in ancient and modern herring abundance (McKechnie and Smith 2013). In more recent years, other factors such as food availability and environmental forcing, rather than heavy fishing pressure, likely play a larger role in the overall abundance throughout its range (Hay <em>et al. </em>2001a, Ward <em>et al. </em>2017, 2019), as most fisheries appear to be regulated and respond to management. For example, in British Columbia, precautionary harvest policies have been in place since 1986 (i.e., stocks are managed using a 20% harvest rate and a commercial fishery threshold of 25% of the estimated unfished spawning biomass, 0.25B<sub>0</sub>: Cleary <em>et al. </em>2010). Since policies have been in place, most major stocks within British Columbia experienced declines in biomass until 2010 (Schweigert <em>et al</em>. 2010). Similarly, all five major British Columbian stocks experienced declines in weight-at-age from the mid-1980’s to 2010, with a levelling off and/or increase in the most recent five years available (2012 – 2017: DFO 2018). Additionally, herring in British Columbia previously displayed a long-term decline in size-at-age, suggesting a possible reduction or limitation of the food supply or other resources that may have prevented recovery (Schweigert <em>et al.</em> 2010); however, this declining trend has reversed in the most recent years (2010 – present: Hay <em>et al. </em>2019). </p>  <p>It is known that the spawning distribution of this species changes naturally throughout its range in response to local abundance and environmental conditions; some areas observe new spawning localities or renewed spawning in previously known localities, while other areas observe a cessation or contraction in known spawning localities leading to concerns about possible depletion of local stocks (Hay <em>et al. </em>2009). More research is needed to determine whether changes are due to fishing pressure or a natural shift in distribution (Hay <em>et al.</em> 2009). There is also evidence to suggest that disease significantly affects recruitment of this species (Marty <em>et al</em>. 2011); however, more research is needed to determine the overall severity of this potential threat.</p>","<p></p><p><strong><u>OVERALL POPULATION TRENDS</u></strong></p>  <p><em>Clupea pallasii</em> is a cold-water clupeid distributed throughout the Arctic and northern Pacific Oceans. Overall, available population information for this species is extremely variable. For example, some regions within its distribution (e.g., northeast Pacific: Alaska, British Columbia, Washington, Oregon, California) have long time series data available (e.g., spawning stock biomass estimates, landings data, etc.), while other regions (e.g., northwest Pacific: Japan, Russia, Korea, China) have little to no current information available. This species, similar to other clupeids, is known to have large episodic recruitments (Schweigert <em>et al.</em> 2007). In the past (e.g., 1977) there has been broad temporal synchrony throughout many years with the arrival of strong cohorts in British Columbia and Alaska (Hay <em>et al.</em> 2001b), though this is not consistent with current trends. Within some areas where data are available, spawning stock biomass (SSB) estimates suggest rapid fluctuations (e.g., Alaska, California, Canada, etc.); however, these SSB estimates are usually asynchronous with respect to neighboring localities. For example, in some localities (e.g., Prince William Sound, Alaska; Cherry Point, Washington; West Coast Vancouver Island, British Columbia) SSB estimates decreased by greater than 85 % over the time series and up to 77 % in the most recent 15 years available (thought to conservatively represent three generation lengths for this species). However, in other localities (e.g., Sitka Sound, Alaska; Quilcene Bay, Washington), SSB estimates have increased by 35 – 1000 % over the time series and up to 400 % in the most recent 15 years available. Given the inconsistencies in the temporal trends of available data within and between regions (including differences in biological characteristics such as maximum age and age at first maturity), we are unable to extrapolate trends in SSB across the entire global population. For consistency, all data reported in short tons (e.g., U.S. data) were converted and are expressed in metric tonnes. </p>  <p>In general, the conservation status of herring within the southernmost portion of its global range (e.g., within the Yellow Sea and off coastal Japan in the western Pacific and off the continental U.S. in the eastern Pacific, including California, Oregon and Washington) is of concern due to climate forcing. Sea surface temperatures are expected to continue to increase in these areas as a result of global climate change (Perry <em>et al. </em>2005, Hillebrand 2018, USGCRP 2018), potentially leading to a northward contraction of its range into cooler waters.</p>  <p><strong><u>NORTHWESTERN PACIFIC</u></strong></p>  <p>Within the northwestern Pacific, this species is divided into three subsections: the northwestern North Pacific, which includes five major stocks in Russian waters; the southwestern North Pacific, which includes the Sakhalin region of Russia and the Hokkaido region of Japan; and the Yellow Sea (Hay <em>et al. </em>2001a). In the northwestern Pacific region, there appear to be three distinct forms of herring: (1) a migratory ‘marine’ herring, which is relatively long-lived and which undergoes considerable migrations; (2) a similar ‘coastal’ form which consists of a number of smaller groups and spends most of its life close to shore with little or no migrations; and (3) a unique ‘lagoon’ form (sometimes referred to as ‘lake’ herring) whose life history is connected with low-salinity lagoons or embayments (Hay <em>et al. </em>2001a). In general, the five major Russian stocks, along with the Hokkaido-Sakhalin stock constitute the major ‘marine’ forms of the western Pacific, which comprise the largest total biomass and support large commercial fisheries in the northwest Pacific (Hay <em>et al. </em>2001a). Coastal and ‘lagoon’ forms may be unique to the western Pacific; similar forms have not been described from the eastern Pacific (Hay <em>et al. </em>2001a). Specific information regarding the three subsections in the northwestern Pacific is listed below.</p>  <p><strong><u>Northwestern North Pacific (Russia):</u></strong><em> </em>Five major stocks exist within this region: Korf-Karagin stock in the northwestern Bering Sea; Gizhiga-Kamchatka stock along the Kamchatka Peninsula; Okhotsk stock in the Sea of Okhotsk; Dekastri stock in the Strait of Tartary; and Peter the Great Bay stock in the Sea of Japan (Hay <em>et al. </em>2001a). Additionally, Russian scientists recognize roughly 20 smaller groups of ‘coastal’ and ‘lagoon’ herring (Hay <em>et al. </em>2001a). Commercial fisheries for Dekastri and Peter the Great Bay stocks were established first (~1920s); substantial commercial fisheries began to target other stocks in later years (Korf-Karagin in 1939, and Okhotsk and Gizhiga-Kamchatka in the mid – to late – 1940s: Hay <em>et al. </em>2001a). Catch records are characterized by substantial variation in annual catch overall, reflecting fluctuations in the availability of herring (Hay <em>et al. </em>2001a). The three northernmost stocks (Okhotsk, Gizhiga-Kamchatka and Korf-Karagin) previously supported very large catches which increased rapidly in the late 1950s and exceeded ~500,000 tonnes in the 1960s (Hay <em>et al. </em>2001a). This peak was followed by a rapid decline in all five ‘marine’ stocks where a decline in catch rates and assessed biomass led to a prohibition of commercial fishing (Hay <em>et al. </em>2001a). A period of very low abundance persisted until the late 1990s where there was evidence of a modest recovery of the Okhotsk and Korf-Karagin stocks (Hay <em>et al. </em>2001a). As of the early 2000s, the southernmost Russian stocks (Dekastri and Peter the Great Bay) remained in a state of severe depression (Hay <em>et al. </em>2001a). Information regarding the more recent status (i.e., 2001 – present) is not available for these five major stocks. </p>  <p><strong><u>Southwestern North Pacific (Hokkaido-Sakhalin):</u></strong><em> </em>One major stock is recognized within this subsection of the northwestern Pacific waters, which includes the waters off the Sakhalin region of Russia and the Hokkaido region of Japan. It is referred to as Hokkaido-Sakhalin herring (sometimes also referred to as Sakhalin-Hokkaido herring). Previously, this stock was the most abundant among all western Pacific herring stocks (Hay <em>et al. </em>2001a). During the first half of the 1900s, Hokkaido-Sakhalin herring were very widely distributed and supported an industrial fishery in the northern part of the Sea of Japan, the Sea of Okhotsk (along the shores of eastern Sakhalin to the Island of Iona, and along the Kuril Islands to the Island of Paramushir), and the Pacific Ocean (along the southern Kuril Islands: Hay <em>et al. </em>2001a). Catches have been recorded by national and provincial authorities in Japan and Russia since 1887, with a historical peak of 973,000 tonnes in 1897 (Hay <em>et al. </em>2001a). Since the peak in 1897, catches show fluctuations with an overall declining annual trend and fishing grounds moved north along the western coast of Hokkaido; spawning herring have disappeared from the Hokkaido coast altogether (Hay <em>et al. </em>2001a). In the most recent years available (~ 1960s – 2000), the Hokkaido-Sakhalin herring has been at the lowest level of abundance for the entire history of its commercial exploitation; it has declined from an average of 67.2 billion fish in the late 1800s – 1950 to about 5.8 billion fish in the 1950s, and has further declined to an average of 1.6 billion fish between 1961 and 2000 (Hay <em>et al. </em>2001a). Small fisheries have continued since the collapse of this stock with annual catches less than 50,000 tonnes on average (Hay <em>et al. </em>2001a). The cause of collapse is not certain; oceanographic conditions (e.g., sea surface temperature) have changed, which may limit recruitment in the region. Additionally, the major decline coincided with a period of increased effort, efficiency and industrialization of the fishery (e.g., introduction of acoustic sounders, spotter planes and trawl nets) where immature and young fish were caught in high numbers, which likely further limited recruitment. As of 2000, there were no indications of change in the extremely depressed status of the Hokkaido-Sakhalin herring (Hay <em>et al. </em>2001a); information regarding the more recent status (2001 – present) is not available for this stock.</p>  <p><strong><u>Yellow Sea:</u></strong> Herring in the Yellow Sea may be completely isolated from others within the northwestern Pacific (Yeon <em>et al. </em>2008). In the Yellow Sea region, this species undergoes rapid and extreme fluctuations in abundance. Changes in biomass may be caused by herring seasonally moving in an out of the Yellow Sea (D. Hay, pers. com. January 2019); long-term changes may be correlated with a 36-year cycle of dryness/wetness in eastern China (Hay <em>et al. </em>2001a). It is commercially important in the Yellow Sea and has a very long exploitation history in the surrounding countries. In the last century (1900 – 2000) the commercial fishery experienced three major peaks (1900, 1938 and 1972) followed by periods of little to no catch (Hay <em>et al. </em>2001a). This stock experienced a historical maximum abundance in 1972 following a strong recruitment event in 1970; biomass was estimated to be 200,000 tonnes in 1972 (Hay <em>et al. </em>2001a). However, since 1982, this species has substantially declined in the Yellow Sea due to a series of very weak year classes (Hay <em>et al. </em>2001a). The catch decreased to below 1,000 tonnes in 1989 – 1990 and no fishing took place until at least 2000 (Hay <em>et al. </em>2001a). Currently, it is listed as a species of special concern in the Yellow Sea as abundance has decreased significantly and it requires protection and enhancement programs (National Fisheries Research and Development Institute 1988 as cited in Yeon <em>et al. </em>2008).</p>  <p>Overall, nearly all herring in the northwestern Pacific have undergone long-term periods of extreme fluctuations in the past; during periods of active fishing most stocks have declined to a state of depression or even collapse. However, based on the most recent estimates available (prior to 2001), most stocks have recovered to the point where abundance equaled or exceeded historical estimates. Pacific herring within the Hokkaido-Sakhalin and Yellow Sea regions are of concern as its abundance has remained severely depleted in the most recent years available. </p>  <p><strong><u>NORTHEASTERN PACIFIC </u></strong></p>  <p>In contrast to the northwestern Pacific, where this species is found in a few, large subpopulations, in the northeastern Pacific, it consists of a large number of (&gt;20) relatively small subpopulations (Hay <em>et al.</em> 2001a), many of which have long-term time series data available that continue to the present. For the purposes of this assessment, the delineation of this species within the northeastern Pacific encompasses its geographic distribution throughout western U.S. and Canadian territories, from Alaska, south to California. Available species-specific information regarding the northeastern Pacific is described below.</p>  <p><strong><u>Alaska (U.S.)</u></strong><strong></strong></p>  <p><strong><em>Western Alaska:</em></strong></p>  <p><em><u>Arctic – Yukon – Kuskokwim (AYK) region: </u></em>Projected 2018 biomass for the Arctic – Yukon – Kuskokwim region (Norton Sound south to Security Cove) was estimated to be 54,782 tonnes (ADF&amp;G 2018a). The largest abundance of herring in the AYK region is in the Norton Sound district (Menard <em>et al. </em>2017); projected biomass for this district in 2018 is 30,775 tonnes, which makes up over half of the total projected biomass for the AYK region (57,782 tonnes: ADF&amp;G 2018a). Total allowable harvest is 10,683 tonnes. Commercial fishing may occur in this region in 2018 given that all preseason projected biomass thresholds are expected to be exceeded (ADF&amp;G 2018a). However, based on limited fishing effort from previous years and a lack of market interest in the region since 2006, only a small portion of the total allowable catch is anticipated to be taken in 2018 (ADF&amp;G 2018a). A commercial fishery is not anticipated in the Kuskokwim district due to a lack of market interest; a small commercial bait fishery is anticipated out of Norton Sound in 2018 (ADF&amp;G 2018a). Catch monitoring will be implemented if commercial fishing occurs (ADF&amp;G 2018a). </p>  <p><em><u>Togiak District (Bristol Bay)</u></em><u>: </u>The preseason biomass forecast for 2018 in the Togiak district was projected to be 124,062 tonnes, which is considered healthy and stable (ADF&amp;G 2018b). Herring in the Togiak district are commercially harvested for sac roe, spawn on kelp, as well as for food and bait; the herring fishery in this district is the largest in Alaska (ADF&amp;G 2018b). The commercial sac roe fishery was opened in this region in 2018; however, no commercial harvest of spawn on kelp took place in 2017 due to a lack of commercial interest (ADF&amp;G 2018b). </p>  <p>Overall, the recent abundance in the Bering Sea (early 2000s), based mainly on SSB estimated from the Togiak district, is much lower (~140,000 tonnes) than the highest estimate of nearly 500,000 tonnes in 1985 (Hay <em>et al. </em>2001a). The abundance of the many smaller stocks in the same region showed no clear trends in time (Hay <em>et al</em>. 2001a). </p>  <p><strong><em>Central Alaska:</em></strong></p>  <p>Information from Central Alaska is available from the Prince William Sound district. A Bayesian assessment of this species within the Prince William Sound was conducted using biomass data up to 2013; findings indicate that abundance remains at low levels in recent years (Muradian <em>et al. </em>2017). Aerial survey acoustic estimates of SSB from 1973 – 2016 agree with the Bayesian assessment; SSB, although stable, has remained at very low levels since the mid- to late-1990s following a drastic decline in the late 1980s (Russell <em>et al. </em>2017). All commercial fisheries for this species in the Prince William Sound have remained closed for 17 consecutive years because age structure and the available surplus in the spawning biomass currently does not support a fishery in this region (Russell <em>et al. </em>2017). </p>  <p><strong><em>Southeast Alaska:</em></strong></p>  <p>Long-term time series of SSB estimates are available for most stocks within Southeast Alaska, including Sitka Sound, Lynn Canal, Seymour Canal, Craig, Ernest Sound, Hobart Bay- Port Houghton, Hoonah Sound, Revilla Channel (including Kah Shakes- Cat Island and Annette Island Reserve), Seymour Canal, West Behm Canal and Tenakee Inlet (Hebert 2017). Stocks in southeastern Alaska have asynchronous SSB trends; some stocks have declined in the most recent 15 years available (e.g., Ernest Sound, Hobart Bay – Port Houghton, Hoonah Sound, Seymour Canal, Tenakee Inlet), while others have remained stable (e.g., Sitka Sound, Revilla Channel, West Behm Canal), or increased (e.g., Lynn Canal, Craig). Overall, combined SSB estimates show a fluctuating pattern in the most recent 15 years (2003 – 2017) with a declining trend since the most recent peak (2011); however, SSB appears to have stabilized at a low level in the most recent 4 – 5 years available (Hebert 2017). The total combined SSB estimates in 2017 for all of Southeast Alaska as calculated from spawn deposition estimates was 62,457 tonnes and is at a similar level to that of the late 1990s (Hebert 2017). Overall, the relatively stable pattern between 2016 and 2017 SSB estimates can be largely attributed to changes in the two largest stocks, which typically account for about 80 % of the total SSB in southeastern Alaska – Sitka Sound showed a decline of approximately 41 % between 2016 and 2017, while Craig showed an increase in 2017 roughly double that of 2016 (Hebert 2017). Despite overall stability in the most recent 4 – 5 years, there was a decline between 2016 and 2017 (~ 26 %). However, several areas (i.e., Lynn Canal, West Behm Canal, Revilla Channel, Tenakee Inlet, Ernest Sound, Hoonah Sound and Hobart Bay-Port Houghton) were not surveyed in 2017 and this may have led to some of the discrepancy between the two years (Hebert 2017). Combined spawn deposition estimates for 2017 suggest that SSB in southeast Alaska is at a moderate level relative to the period 1980 – 2016 (Hebert 2017). The combined SSB estimate of 62,457 tonnes is about 67 % of the mean SSB (1980 – 2016); however, this is considered to be an underestimate because several areas were not surveyed in 2017 (Hebert 2017). </p>  <p><strong><u>British Columbia (Canada)</u></strong></p>  <p>This species in British Columbian waters is divided into five major stock areas that are assessed regularly: Haida Gwaii (HG), Prince Rupert District (PRD), Central Coast (CC), Strait of Georgia (SOG), and West Coast of Vancouver Island (WCVI); and two minor stock areas: Haida Gwaii Area 2W and WCVI Area 27 (DFO 2018). Each major stock area is made up of numerous smaller spawning groups (D. Hay, pers. comm. January 2019). Spawning stock biomass (SSB) estimates are available for the five major stocks until 2017 and estimates have been projected to forecast the 2018 SSB (DFO 2018). In general, all five major stocks show a decline in weight-at-age from the mid-1980s to 2010, with a leveling off or slight increase in the most recent five years available (2012 – 2017: DFO 2018, Hay <em>et al. </em>2019). Stocks within the Haida Gwaii and West of Vancouver Island regions, however, continue to show a declining SSB trend in recent years (DFO 2018). Additionally, there is a large portion of the British Columbian coast (e.g., Johnstone Strait) where many small spawning groups exist but are not assessed regularly and no commercial fisheries occur (D. Hay, pers. comm. January 2019). In this region, herring predominantly reach maturity at age three (DFO 2018). </p>  <p>&#160;<strong><em>Haida Gwaii:</em></strong></p>  <p>Estimates of SSB have remained low in the most recent years available, including 2017; two models estimate a declining trend in SSB since 2013 (DFO 2018). Additionally, since 2000, the Haida Gwaii stock has been in a low productivity, low biomass state, which indicates a negative stock growth (DFO 2018). Median estimated SSB in 2017 was 3,963 tonnes and the projected median pre-fishery SSB estimate for 2018 is similar to the 2017 level (4,367 tonnes: DFO 2018).</p>  <p><strong><em>Prince Rupert District:</em></strong></p>  <p>This stock has been characterized by two periods of consistent and stable spawning biomass: 1996 – 2003 and 2006 – 2007 (DFO 2018). Since 2005, estimated SSB productions have been positive, indicating stock growth (DFO 2018). The median estimated SSB in 2017 was 21,738 tonnes and the projected median pre-fishery SSB for 2018 is similar to 2017 (23,924 tonnes: DFO 2018).</p>  <p><strong><em>Central Coast:</em></strong></p>  <p>Estimates of SSB show an increasing trend since 2012, including 2017 (DFO 2018). Since 2012, estimated SSB production for the Central Coast stock has been positive, indicating stock growth (DFO 2018). The median estimated SSB in 2017 was 30,474 tonnes; projected median pre-fishery SSB estimates for 2018 is similar to 2017 (32,458 tonnes: DFO 2018).</p>  <p><strong><em>Strait of Georgia:</em></strong></p>  <p>Estimates of SSB show an increasing trend since 2010 (DFO 2018). Since 2008, estimated SSB production for the Strait of Georgia stock has been positive, indicating stock growth. The median estimated SSB in 2017 was 114,626 tonnes; projected median pre-fishery SSB estimates for 2018 are similar to 2017 (125,285 tonnes: DFO 2018).</p>  <p><strong><em>West Coast of Vancouver Island (WCVI):</em></strong></p>  <p>In most years since 2005, including between 2016 and 2017, the WCVI stock has been in a prolonged low productivity, low biomass state, indicating negative stock growth (DFO 2018). Given a decline in estimated SSB, WCVI has been closed to fisheries since 2006, with the exception of the spawn on kelp (SOK) fishery permitted in 2011 (DFO 2018). The median estimated SSB in 2017 was 17,742 tonnes; projected median pre-fishery SSB estimates for 2018 are similar to 2017 (20,003 tonnes: DFO 2018). </p>  <p><strong><u>Washington (U.S.)</u></strong></p>  <p>This species is separated into 21 small stocks within four major stock regions in inland Washington waters, including north Puget Sound, south-central Puget Sound, Hood Canal, and the Strait of Juan de Fuca (combined, these areas are now referred to as the “southern Salish Sea”). In this region, only the Cherry Point and Squaxin Pass stocks can be genetically differentiated; the other herring stocks have not shown genetic divergence, suggesting adequate gene flow (WDFW, 2018a). </p>  <p>Spawning stock data are available for most stocks through 2018 (WDFW 2018b). Stocks can fall into one of seven categories based on the previous 4 – year mean abundance compared to long-term previous 25 – year abundance (Stick <em>et al.</em> 2014): <strong>Increasing</strong> - A stock with recent 4-year mean abundance more than 20% above the 25-year mean; <strong>Healthy</strong> - A stock with recent 4-year mean abundance within 20% of the 25-year mean; <strong>Declining</strong> - A stock with recent 4-year mean abundance 21-50% below the 25-year mean; <strong>Depressed</strong> - A stock with recent 4-year mean abundance 51-80% below the 25-year mean; <strong>Critical</strong> - A stock with recent 4-year mean abundance 81-99% below the 25-year mean; <strong>Undetected</strong> - A stock that can no longer be found in a formerly consistently utilized spawning ground for four consecutive years; <strong>Unknown</strong>- Insufficient assessment data to identify stock status with confidence. Overall, 19% of stocks were listed as Increasing or Healthy in 2016, though the percentage of stocks listed as such has steadily declined over the years available (e.g., 38% in 2000: WDFW 2018b). Currently, three stocks are listed as Increasing (i.e., Quilcene Bay, Samish/Portage Bay and Semiahmoo Bay), one as Healthy (i.e., South Hood Canal), two as Declining&#160; (i.e., Holmes Harbor, Dungeness/Sequim Bay), two as Depressed (Squaxin Pass and Skagit Bay), and ten as Critical (Wallochet Bay, Quartermaster Harbor, Port Orchard-Port Madison, Port Susan, Port Gamble, Killisut Harbor, Discovery Bay, Interior San Juan Islands, Fildalgo Bay and Cherry Point). Three other stocks currently have Unknown status (Purdy, Elliot Bay, Northwest San Juan Islands) due to a lack of long-term data (WDFW 2018b). Excluding the genetically distinct stocks (i.e., Cherry Point and Squaxin Pass), all other Washington herring stocks combined reportedly have a Healthy standing overall (WDFW 2018b), although this is driven by the rapidly expanding Quilcene Bay stock, which currently makes up over 50% of the total estimated spawning biomass. If Quilcene Bay is excluded from the overall total, the remaining stocks are collectively considered to be Declining. Individual stocks listed as Critical (especially the genetically distinct Cherry Point stock which has declined more than 96% since the initial SSB estimate in 1973: WDFW 2018b) are of concern in Washington. </p>  <p>Overall, estimated SSB for all stocks within the Puget Sound has shown a fluctuating trend with an average just under 11,800 tonnes throughout the available time series (1973 – 2017: WDFW 2018b). Using the most recent 15-year window available (2003 – 2017), estimated SSB has declined from 12,287 tonnes in 2003 to 7,790 tonnes in 2017, which represents an approximate 37 % decline within three generations.</p>  <p>There is a limited commercial fishery for herring in Puget Sound which targets 2-3 year old fish for the sport bait market. Over the past decade this fishery has taken an average of 6% of the total estimated biomass for all stocks; no fishing is allowed north of Admiralty Inlet or south of the Tacoma Narrows to protect the Cherry Point and Squaxin Pass stocks.</p>  <p><strong><em>Puget Sound:</em></strong></p>  <p><em><u>Northern Puget Sound (including Cherry Point): </u></em>The Northern Puget Sound region includes the Fidalgo Bay, Samish/Portage Bay, Interior San Juan Islands, NW San Juan Islands, Semiahmoo Bay and Cherry Point stocks. The Cherry Point stock has shown genetic divergence from the remaining stocks (WDFW 2018a) and is of particular concern in this region. The Cherry Point stock status has been listed as Critical since 2000 and has shown a declining trend (greater than 96 %) in SSB estimates since the beginning of the available time series in 1973 (WDFW 2018b).</p>  <p><em><u>South/Central Puget Sound (including Squaxin Pass): </u></em>The South-Central Puget Sound region includes the Purdy, Wollochet Bay, Quartermaster Harbor, Elliot Bay, Port Orchard-Port Madison, South Hood Canal, Quilcene Bay, Port Gamble, Kilisut Harbor, Port Susan, Holmes Harbor, Skagit Bay and Squaxin Pass stocks. The Squaxin Pass stock has shown genetic divergence from the remaining stocks (WDFW 2018a) and is currently in a Depressed state (WDFW 2018b). Of particular concern are the stocks recently reported to be in a Critical condition (i.e., Quartermaster Harbor, Wollochet Bay, and Port Orchard-Port Madison).</p>  <p><strong><em>Strait of Juan de Fuca:</em></strong></p>  <p><em><u>The Strait of Juan de Fuca:</u></em> includes the Kilisut Harbor, Discovery Bay and Dungeness/Sequim Bay stocks. The Discovery Bay stock has been in a Depressed or Critical state since 1996 and remains Critical in 2016. The Dungeness/Sequim Bay stock was reported to be Increasing in 2000 but has been either Declining or Critical since that time. The Kilisut Harbor stock has also declined since 2000, with no spawn detected from 2009-2012 (a Disappearance event), but spawning has returned and the stock was listed as Critical in 2016. </p>  <p><strong><u>Oregon (U.S.)</u></strong></p>  <p>In Oregon, SSB is estimated from the number of spawning adults surveyed in the previous year (Baraff and Loughlin 2000). Biomass estimates exist from Yaquina Bay, Oregon from 1979 – 2011 with a mean of 487 +/- 501 tonnes over a 31 year time series (Thompson <em>et al. </em>2017). Despite an overall decline in SSB estimates throughout the available time series, within the most recent fifteen years available (1997 – 2011), SSB estimates have largely fluctuated but show a 2 – 3 fold increase overall. </p>  <p><strong><u>California (U.S.)</u></strong><strong> </strong></p>  <p>The four largest spawning areas in California are San Francisco Bay, Tomales Bay, Humboldt Bay and Crescent City Harbor (Hay <em>et</em> <em>al.</em> 2001a); however, little to no information is available from Tomales Bay, Humbolt Bay, and Crescent City Harbor. </p>  <p><strong><em>San Francisco Bay: </em></strong></p>  <p>Long-term time series of SSB estimates are available from San Francisco Bay (1979 – 2018) with an average of 44,000 tonnes (CDFW 2018). The SSB estimate in 2017 – 18 was 13,879 tonnes which represents the fourth year in a row of below average estimated SSB (CDFW 2018). </p>  <p>Commercial fishing of this species within San Francisco Bay continued during the 2017 – 18 season at a low level of effort relative to historical levels, which coincided with an estimated SSB well below the long-term average and the fourth year of low overall returns for this fishery (CDFW 2018). Low SSB estimates likely reflect sustained impacts from El Niño conditions (i.e., high sea-surface temperatures and depressed productivity in the California Current Ecosystem: CDFW 2018). </p>  <p>In the most recent 15 years available (2003-04 – 2017-18), SSB has fluctuated with an average of about 37,920 tonnes, but shows a declining trend overall. Estimated SSB in 2003-04 was 31,207 tonnes and has declined to about 13,879 tonnes in 2017-18, representing a decline of 55.5 % within 15 years (thought to represent three generation lengths for this species).</p><p></p>",Unknown,"<p><em>Clupea pallasii </em>is widely distributed throughout the Arctic and northern Pacific Oceans. It occurs in the Arctic from the White Sea, east to the Ob Inlet, and the Beaufort Sea to the Amundsen Gulf off the Yukon, Northern and Nunavut Territories. In the Pacific, this species occurs in the northwest region from the Bering Sea, including the Anadyr Bay and the eastern coast of Kamchatka, south to&#160; northern Japan, and the western coast of Korea; and in the northeast region throughout the Gulf of Alaska including off the coasts of Alaska and British Columbia, south along the coast of Washington, Oregon and California to northern Baja, California (Tester 1937, Whitehead 1985, Hay <em>et al. </em>2001a, Coad and Reist 2004, Kim <em>et al.</em> 2005, Thompson <em>et al. </em>2017). This species has been included in a checklist of fishes from Shandong, China (Cheng and Zhou 1997); however, this requires verification. This species occupies a depth range of 0 - 475 m (Coad and Reist 2004).<strong></strong></p>","<p></p><p>This species is exploited with varying intensity throughout a majority of its geographic distribution. Level of harvest ranges from heavy exploitation in industrial and commercial fisheries to areas of no exploitation such as various small subpopulations within the northeastern Pacific, including those fisheries which have closed due to a low SSB (i.e., Prince William Sound, Alaska: Russell <em>et al. </em>2017) or lack of market interest (i.e., Norton Sound, Alaska: Menard <em>et al. </em>2017). This species appears to be less important in Arctic regions, but in general, it is a highly important commercial species in both western and eastern Pacific regions (Whitehead 1985, Coad and Reist 2004, Canadian Science Advisory Secretariat 2009, Schweigert&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2010,&#160;McKechnie and Smith 2013, McKechnie<em> et al</em>. 2014). It is regarded as the second most important targeted species in the northwest Pacific (Zeller <em>et al. </em>2018); it is one of several important commercial species targeted in Russian Far East territory. This species has been taken in industrial trawl fisheries since the early 1900s but also contributes small quantities to bycatch in trawl, seine and longline industrial fisheries that target other important species such as Alaska pollock, cod and various flatfishes (&lt;3 %: Sobolevskaya and Divovich 2015). It is also taken in commercial purse seine and gill net sac roe, spawn on kelp and other food and bait fisheries (Russell <em>et al. </em>2017). It likely also contributes to bycatch throughout its range. </p><br/><p></p>",Marine,"<p>Given this species ecological and commercial importance, species-specific stock management regulations are in place in parts of its range (e.g., British Columbia, Alaska) such as yearly fishery closures, stock-specific management plans including yearly stock assessments, catch quotas, harvest rates, and biomass reference points (Schweigert <em>et al.</em> 2010, Cleary <em>et al.</em> 2017, Menard <em>et al.</em> 2017). For example, in British Columbia, this species is fished with a 20% harvest rate and commercial fishery threshold (Cleary <em>et al.</em> 2010). During periods of low abundance, closures are implemented in some regions. For example, no commercial removal is currently allowed from the Haida Gwaii, central coast and western coast of Vancouver Island stocks (Cleary <em>et al.</em> 2017). Also, all commercial fisheries for this species in the Prince William Sound have remained closed for 17 consecutive years because age structure and the available surplus in the spawning biomass currently does not support a fishery in this region (Russell <em>et al.</em> 2017). This species geographic distribution also overlaps with many existing marine protected areas (IUCN and UNEP-WCMC 2018). More information in needed to determine how this species is impacted by food availability and climatic variation especially regarding larval and juvenile herring. <strong></strong></p>",Nearctic|Palearctic,,false,false,Global
102904070,183856,Engraulis mordax,Data Deficient,,2021,2020-05-08 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"This species is widely distributed in the eastern Pacific and is common throughout most of its range. It has been fished in the past, but fishing effort has declined. The main driver for declines in estimated spawning stock biomass exceeding 95% in recent years (2005 - 2015) are poorly understood. Some reports indicate that the rapid changes in biomass of this species are caused by a combination of natural life history cycles, varying degrees of fishing pressure and environmental forcing from long-term climatic changes in the California Current Ecosystem. This species has undisputedly recovered from past declines in biomass and periods of low abundance, and the central stock biomass is increasing (2015 – present) since the most recent collapse (2009 – 2015). Therefore, it is suspected that its population can rebound rapidly during years of favourable environmental conditions and low fishing pressure. However, given the short generation length of this species of approximately two years and the rapid variations in population abundance through time, it is difficult to calculate global population declines over a period of ten years (used instead of three generation lengths). There is some concern that climate change may be an additional stressor on current and future physical conditions, especially water temperature, which may impact this species global population. However, major climatic changes are not yet quantified or decoupled from natural regional climate oscillations.&#160;Fishing pressure during times of low abundance can severely and negatively impact this species recovery; therefore, flexible management measures that fluctuate with the most recent stock-level population estimates are critical. Although this species is widely distributed, monitored throughout much of its range, and the central stock of its population has increased in the most recent three years (2017 – 2019), this same stock can be subjected to high fishing pressure relative to low stock size given a multi-year, unchanging quota. In addition, the northern stock has declined by more than 90% in the same three years. The causes leading to the fluctuations exhibited by this species are not yet understood, therefore, <em>Engraulis mordax </em>is listed as Data Deficient.&#160;Due to its known highly variable population biomass and importance as a prey resource, it is recommended that this species continue to be monitored. It is also recommended that key refuge areas (e.g., Gulf of Farallones, Monterey Bay and the inner portion of the Santa Barbara Basin) should be targeted as forage reserve MPAs to facilitate population recovery and trophic interactions.","<p></p><p>This is a marine, pelagic species usually found in coastal waters within about 30 km from shore, but as far out as 480 km. It is found as deep as 310 m (Roberts and Allen 2015). It is known to a maximum standard length of 20.5 cm (Whitehead <em>et al. </em>1988); however maximum sizes vary with latitude. It forms large, tightly packed schools that enter bays and inlets. It feeds on fish eggs, euphausiids, copepods, and decapod larvae, both by random filter-feeding and by pecking at prey (Chiappa-Carrara and Gallardo-Cabello 1993, Sydeman <em>et al. </em>2020).&#160;</p>  <p>This species is an oviparous, epi-pelagic batch spawner, and spawns in inlets or offshore throughout the year depending on favorable environmental conditions, peaking once at night (Hunter and Goldberg 1980, Watson and Sandknop 1996). It predominantly spawns in the winter and early spring.<strong> </strong>Spawning time variability between years and decades is apparent (Asch 2015) and may be aligned with peak plankton production similar to the Peruvian anchoveta, <em>Engraulis ringens</em> (Contreras-Reyes <em>et al. </em>2016). Individuals spawn in areas between British Colombia and Magdalena Bay, Baja California. The largest subpopulation (central) spawns most abundantly within the Southern California Bight (Point of Conception, California to Ensenada, Baja California: Fiedler <em>et al. </em>1986, Sydeman <em>et al. </em>2020), and Monterey Bay to San Francisco off central California (Bakun <em>et al. </em>2014). Females of the central subpopulation can produce up to ~14,000 eggs per year (Parrish <em>et al. </em>1986). Larvae typically reside within the first 50 metres of the water column (Ahlstrom 1959, Sydeman <em>et al. </em>2020). Individuals within the central subpopulation are estimated to reach maturity at one year (Sydeman <em>et al. </em>2020) with earlier estimates at two years (Smith 1985). However, the maximum age of this species within the central subpopulation has decreased from eight years (Mais 1981) to four years (MacCall 2009), indicating a potential major life-history shift (Sydeman <em>et al. </em>2020). Using one year as the age of maturity and a maximum longevity of four years, its generation length is estimated to be two years; therefore, changes in population should be calculated using a ten-year time window. However, given the short generation length of this species coupled with drastic variations in population abundance through time, it is difficult to calculate declines over a period of ten years (used instead of 3 generation lengths) and therefore, care should be taken when interpreting results as they are subject to change drastically from year to year.</p>  <p>This is an important food source for sea birds and marine mammals, and its recent decline (2006 – 2015) coincides with die-offs of these species, including sea lions and pelicans (MacCall&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016, McClatchie&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2016).</p><br/><p></p>","<p></p><p>This species was previously fished at high levels (1980's), but fishing is now maintained at a low level relative to historic median biomass (Sydeman <em>et al. </em>2020, FAO 2020). However, despite the low fisheries take of the largest stock (the central subpopulation distributed from San Francisco Bay to central Baja California: Sydeman <em>et al. </em>2020), the current multi-year unchanging catch limit outlined by the National Marine Fisheries Service (NOAA 2019) fails to capture the frequent, and sometimes rapid boom and bust cycles of anchovy biomass, which may lead to overfishing of this ecologically critical species in times of low biomass. Furthermore, fishing pressure may have reduced the average lifespan, net lifetime fecundity, and mean spawning age overtime, which likely contributes to more variability in population size (Lindegren <em>et al. </em>2013, Sydeman <em>et al. </em>2020). </p>  <p>The main driver behind recent drastic population declines is not yet understood but may be related to environmental shifts in upwelling, currents, and water temperature (Miller and McGowan 2013, Koslow&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2015). The impact from climate change is not yet decoupled from historical regional climate oscillation processes (e.g., from El Niño/La Niña events, Pacific Decadal Oscillation and Aleutian Lows). The response to environmental factors is a key population response by this species and can result in disproportionate and rapid growth or contraction along the coast and offshore (Checkley <em>et al.</em> 2017, Sydeman <em>et al. </em>2020). Therefore, it is suspected that warming waters related to change in climate may negatively impact this species, given that the fish community in this region is largely comprised of fishes with a cool-water affinity. Warming waters may also presumably cause a redistribution of species, including <em>E</em>. <em>mordax,</em> in the northeast Pacific region (Cheung&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2015) as well as deleterious shifts in spawning phenology (Asch 2015). However, this is still unclear, and recent evidence suggests the central stock of this species is doing well in warmer than average water temperatures (Stierhoff <em>et al. </em>2019, 2020). </p><br/><p></p>","<p><strong>GLOBAL POPULATION INFORMATION:</strong></p><p>This species is divided into three recognized subpopulations (McHugh 1951) based on evidence from morphometric characters (Spratt 1972), protein variation (Vrooman and Palmoa 1975, Vrooman et al. 1981, Diaz-Jaimes et al. 1999) and genetic analyses (LaCompte et al. 2004). The northern subpopulation occurs in waters off British Columbia to northern California, the central subpopulation extends from San Francisco Bay to Central Baja California in the southern California Current Ecosystem (CCE), and the southern subpopulation is distributed from central to southern Baja California and into the Gulf of California (Sydeman <em>et al. </em>2020). </p><p>This species is characterized by highly variable population dynamics. For example, the central subpopulation biomass has varied by two orders of magnitude from a collapsed state (&lt;100,000 metric tonnes) such as in the early 1950s and early 2010s, to peaks in biomass over 2 million metric tonnes (MacCall <em>et al. </em>2016, Thayer <em>et al. </em>2017) using CalCOFI egg and larval surveys (Sydeman <em>et al. </em>2020). Given the short generation length of this species (approximately 2 years) and the drastic variations in population abundance through time, it is difficult to calculate declines over a period of ten years (used instead of 3 generation lengths) and therefore, care should be taken when interpreting results. </p><p>Past pronounced biomass fluctuations in this species and the co-occurring Pacific sardine (<em>Sardinops sagax</em>) have spanned several orders of magnitude. These fluctuations in biomass occur with a periodicity and have been linked, in varying degrees to intensive fishing, biological interaction within and among species, and environmental forcing associated with long-term climatic changes (Baumgartner <em>et al.</em> 1992), such as El-Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events, and changes in the Aleutian Low, as reflected by the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) index (Minobe <em>et al. </em>1997). Likewise measured and modeled fluctuations in recruitment and growth rate have been associated with local patterns of flow, upwelling, and physical/biotic conditions of the California Current System that also influence zooplankton availability (Fissel&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2011, Takahashi<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2012, Lindegren&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2013,&#160;Koslow&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2013, 2014, Leising&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014, Ralston&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2015, Skrivanek and Hendy 2015). Major changes in ocean dynamics, climatic changes and natural life history(Lindegren <em>et al. </em>2013) result in corresponding shifts in spawning sites and range of this species, and are likely due to population contraction or expansion during periods of low or high biomass (McCall <em>et al. </em>2016). The central subpopulation of this species, and presumably the northern and southern subpopulations undergo a northward redistribution during years of warmer water (Sydeman <em>et al. </em>2020). This key population response can result in disproportionate and rapid growth or contraction along the coast and offshore (Checkley <em>et al.</em> 2017, Sydeman <em>et al. </em>2020).</p><p>Over a 500-year period (AD 1000-1500), anchovy populations increased during climate conditions that included greater coastal upwelling and dry southern California weather, which is associated with cool/negative PDO conditions (Shrivanek and Hendy 2015). According to paleorecords spanning the past 500 years, which includes time prior to commercial exploitation, this species global population has collapsed and recovered several times with an average recovery time of 8 years (McClatchie&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017). These historical trends also indicate that during a collapse period, biomass of forage fishes can remain low for 1-2 decades (McClatchie&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017). This species, and others within the California Current System have broadly declined in recent decades (1970's to 2010), not as a result of exploitation, but due to large scale changes in environmental forcing (Miller and McGowan 2013, Koslow&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2015). The potential role that climate change plays in these environmental changes is uncertain, but warming waters would presumably negatively impact this community, which is largely comprised of fishes with a cool-water affinity, and cause a redistribution of species in the Northeast Pacific region (Cheung&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2015) as well as deleterious shifts in spawning phenology (Asch 2015). However, the estimated central stock biomass increased after a good recruitment event in 2015, despite warmer than average water temperatures (Stierhoff <em>et al</em>. 2019, 2020). </p><p><strong>SUBPOPULATION-SPECIFIC INFORMATION:</strong></p><p><strong>Northern subpopulation:</strong></p><p>Historically, this species has been intermittently abundant throughout the northern part of the northern subpopulation range (e.g., Salish Sea, which includes all inland waters of Washington State and southern British Columbia; made up of the Strait of Georgia, Strait of Juan de Fuca and the Puget Sounds: Duguid <em>et al. </em>2019). The most pronounced peaks in abundance in the Salish Sea since the 1940s began in 2014 – 2015 and has extended at least into the spring of 2017 (Duguid <em>et al. </em>2019). Duguid <em>et al. </em>(2019) reports that this species consistently utilizes certain regions within the Salish Sea when abundant (e.g., Fraser River plume, mainland shore of the Strait of Georgia, and South Puget Sound). Documented egg and larval timing as well as size frequency shifts indicate year-round residence, spawning and successful recruitment within the Salish Sea (Duguid <em>et al. </em>2019). The commercial fishery within the Salish Sea region resulted in the largest landings on record in 2016 and concentrated on anchovy within the Columbia Estuary (Duguid <em>et al. </em>2019). However, it is uncertain whether these recent high catch rates reflect a true increase in abundance, a contraction into nearshore habitat during low population abundance, increasing effort, or unusual oceanographic conditions (Duguid <em>et al. </em>2019).</p><p>Based on an acoustic-trawl survey conducted by NOAA’s Southwest Fisheries Science Center (SWFSC) which sampled waters from the northern tip of Vancouver Island, British Columbia to southern California, the estimated biomass of the northern subpopulation was 22,709 metric tonnes in 2017 and extended from approximately Cape Flattery, Washington to Newport, Oregon (Zwolinski <em>et al. </em>2019). Estimated biomass declined in 2019 to 1,811 metric tonnes and extended from Westport, Washington to Coos Bay, Oregon (Stierhoff <em>et al. </em>2020).</p><p><strong>Central subpopulation:</strong></p><p>The central subpopulation is the most abundant of the three subpopulations and is well studied (e.g., Smith 1972, Parrish <em>et al. </em>1985, Peterman and Bradford 1987, Lindegren <em>et al. </em>2013, MacCall <em>et al. </em>2016, Rykaczewski <em>et al. </em>2019, Sydeman <em>et al. </em>2020). The last comprehensive stock assessment for this subpopulation was in 1994 (Jacobson <em>et al.</em> 1994, 1995). More recently, surveys for this subpopulation have been conducted using acoustic trawl methodology (e.g., Zwolinski <em>et al. </em>2014, 2017). Seasonal egg and larvae standing stock data are available for the core of this subpopulation’s range from the fishery-independent long-term monitoring survey known as the California Cooperative Oceanic Fisheries Investigations<strong> </strong>(CalCOFI). Time-series data on juvenile (age 0) and adult (age 1+) are also available from central to southern California from 2004 – present (Ralston <em>et al. </em>2015, Thompson <em>et al. </em>2018, Santora <em>et al. </em>2020, Sydeman <em>et al. </em>2020). </p><p>In the 1950s, spawning biomass was very low at roughly 10,000–20,000 metric tonnes (MacCall <em>et al. </em>2016, Thayer <em>et al. </em>2017).&#160;Biomass increased and fluctuated between 0.5 and 2 million metric tonnes between 1960 and 1990 (MacCall <em>et al. </em>2016, Thayer <em>et al. </em>2017). After 1990, spawning biomass fluctuated around 200,000 tons, briefly increasing substantially between 2005–2006 to a peak of 2 million metric tonnes. A small fishery exists in the central subpopulation range from San Francisco to&#160;northern Baja, Mexico (Fissel&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2011). However, despite the absence of a significant fishery in both California and Mexico (with the exception of high landings in California of 10,000 and 17,000 tonnes, respectively, relative to stock biomass in 2014 and 2015: CDFW 2020), there has been a recent collapse of anchovy abundance off California (northern California to Baja California), where the estimated spawning biomass declined by over 99% from the peak (2 million metric tonnes) in 2005 – 2006 to less than 100,000 metric tonnes (collapsed state) in 2009 and further decreasing to below 20,000 metric tonnes in 2011 where it remained through 2015 (MacCall <em>et al. </em>2016), which is the lowest seen in the past 60 years (MacCall <em>et al. </em>2016, Thayer <em>et al. </em>2017).&#160;Additionally, Ralston <em>et al. </em>(2015) has reported declines in adult anchovy catch and<strong> </strong>the relative abundance of eggs and larvae also declined substantially over the past two decades (Leising&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014). Declines have been attributed to increased egg mortality (Fissel <em>et al. </em>2011) presumably related to ocean conditions (Koslow&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2013, Lindegren&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2013). The direct driver of this apparently natural decline is not understood. </p><p>Continuous egg sampling by CalCOFI indicated persistent low abundance and limited spawning through 2015 off central and southern California (MacCall&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016). Recent estimates after 2015, such as those made by acoustic-trawl surveys in 2016 (Zwolinski <em>et al. </em>2017), 2017 (Zwolinski <em>et al. </em>2019) and 2019 (Stierhoff <em>et al. </em>2020), suggest that the subpopulation has rebounded substantially (Sydeman <em>et al. </em>2020) and is more than five times larger than estimates in 2015 (Zwolinski <em>et al. </em>2019). However, these estimates are based on different techniques than those used by MacCall <em>et al. </em>(2016) and Thayer <em>et al. </em>(2017) and may not be directly comparable (Sydeman <em>et al. </em>2020). Nonetheless, the most recent biomass estimate (2019) of the central subpopulation throughout most of its central range by acoustic-trawl sampling was determined to be 810,634 metric tonnes (Stierhoff <em>et al. </em>2020), increasing from just over 153,000 metric tonnes from the 2017 estimate (Zwolinski <em>et al. </em>2019).</p><p><strong>Southern subpopulation:</strong></p><p>Little information on the southern subpopulation of this species is available.<strong> </strong>According to genetic studies, the populations between the Gulf of California, Mexico and the Pacific are homogenous (LeComte&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2004, Diaz-Viloria&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2012). The Gulf of California stock had an estimated spawning biomass of 135,147 metric tonnes in 1992, which was an El Niño positive year (Green-Ruiz and Cotero-Altamirano 2009).</p><p>This species is captured as part of the small pelagic purse seine&#160;fishery in the Gulf of California, of which the Pacific sardine (<em>Sardinops sagax</em>) is the most valued species and comprises on average 55% of the total catch (Del Monte-Luna&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2011).<strong>&#160;</strong>Its distribution within the Gulf of California is thought to be a potentially important alternative fishery resource when <em>S. sagax </em>undergoes declines (Green-Ruiz and Cotero-Altamirano 2009). Commercial landings of this species have varied greatly in the locality since 1986 (Green-Ruiz and Cotero-Altamirano 2009).</p><p>                                Off the west coast of Baja California, the total catch of small pelagic fish in 2017 was 128,510 metric tonnes, which was 92% higher than the most recent average between 2003 – 2016 (~67,000 tonnes annually); this species accounted for 10.6% of total small pelagic catch (Enciso-Enciso <em>et al. </em>2018).&#160;</p>",Unknown,"<p></p><p>This species is widely distributed in the eastern Pacific from Haida Gwaii (Queen Charlotte Islands), British Columbia south to Cape San Lucas, Baja California, Mexico and into the Gulf of California (Whitehead&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>1988, Robertson and Allen 2015, Sydeman&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2020). It is known to depths down to 310 metres (Robertson and Allen 2015).</p><br/><p></p>","<p>This species is taken in commercial fisheries and as live bait for tuna fisheries in parts of its range (Whitehead <em>et al. </em>1988, Rodríguez-Sánchez <em>et al. </em>2001). Harvesting sites are mainly in Mexico (Magdalena Bay, Baja California: Rodríguez-Sánchez <em>et al. </em>2001) and in FAO fishing area 77 off California (Whitehead <em>et al. </em>1988, Whitehead and Rodríguez-Sánchez 1995). In the late 1940s- early 1950s this species was restricted by law for use solely as a baitfish in California (Whitehead <em>et al.</em> 1988). In times of high abundance, it is processed into fishmeal and oil, used as bait for tuna and other fisheries, and occasionally canned throughout its range, including in British Columbia, California and Mexico (Whitehead <em>et al. </em>1988, Whitehead and Rodríguez-Sánchez 1995, Rodríguez-Sánchez <em>et al. </em>2001, FAO 2020). The U.S. catch is currently used for human consumption, animal food, live bait, and reduction into fishmeal and fish oil (Fissel&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2011). Peak global landings were in 1981 at just over 424,000 metric tonnes (FAO 2020). Landings declined since the peak in 1981 and have fluctuated with an average of 24,000 metric tonnes since 1990 (FAO 2020).</p>",Marine,"<p>Due to the reduction in fishing effort on this species in California, no stock assessments have been conducted for the central stock since 1994 (Jacobson <em>et al.</em> 1994, 1995), but abundance is monitored as part of long-term ecological monitoring programs (Fissel&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2011, Sydeman <em>et al. </em>2020). The recent collapse detected in California (2009 -2015), though not caused by exploitation, is reason for fishery managers to consider that current exploitation rates could be high given the low stock abundance (MacCall&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016). Currently, the small pelagic fishery in Mexico is regulated by Mexican Official Norm NOM-003-PESC-1993, which limits the amount of fishing north of 21° N, including the Gulf of California, authorizes the substitution of active fishing boats with new and improved ones with better refrigeration systems, and specifies the length at first catch for this species at 10 cm. Additionally, every three months, the fishing and academic sectors and federal authorities gather together to analyze developments in the small pelagics fishery on the basis of information generated from constant stock and environmental monitoring and, if necessary, to adopt proper management actions (Del Monte-Luna&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2011). Management of fishing effort during periods of low biomass may benefit from varying exploitation rates to protect the forage, the ﬁshery and the non-human predators by preserving the seed stock for recovery. Sydeman <em>et al. </em>(2020) suggests that to support both a fishery and predator populations, abundance of this species should exceed the long-term median biomass of 380,000 metric tonnes. However, due to the inevitable natural fluctuations of this species' population, fisheries management cannot prevent collapses from occurring (McClatchie&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017). It is also recommended that key refuge areas (e.g., Gulf of Farallones, Monterey Bay and the inner portion of the Santa Barbra Basin) should be targeted as forage reserve MPAs to facilitate population recovery and trophic interactions during periods of low abundance (Sydeman <em>et al. </em>2020).</p>","",,false,false,Global

119333622,3897,Caretta caretta,Vulnerable,A2b,2017,2015-08-23 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<em><strong>Rationale<br/></strong></em>The global population of the Loggerhead Turtle (<em>Caretta caretta</em>) comprises 10 subpopulations (see Figure 2 in the Supplementary Material) that vary widely in population size, geographic range, and population trends, and are the appropriate units for assessment of global conservation status for this species (Wallace <em>et al</em>. 2010, 2011). As such, assessments have been completed for each of the 10 subpopulations, in addition to the combined global population assessment required by the IUCN (see Table 1 in the Supplementary Material). At the global level, both geographic distribution and population size are much larger than required to qualify for a threatened category. The available long-term series of nest counts (used as an index of population abundance) show an important decrease in the past (47%). Therefore, the Loggerhead Turtle is considered as Vulnerable under current IUCN Red List Criteria (criterion A2b). The previous listing, published in 1996, was Endangered under criterion A1bd (Marine Turtle Specialist Group 1996).<br/><br/>Results indicate that the Loggerhead Turtle, as a single taxonomic entity, will not go extinct globally in the next generation according to any Red List criteria. However, the global listing is not an appropriate representation of the conservation status of the biologically relevant subpopulations that make up the global Loggerhead Turtle population. Subpopulation assessments demonstrated wide variation not only in status of individual subpopulations (as indicated by IUCN Red List Categories), but also in the criteria under which the individual subpopulations qualified for a threatened category (see Table 1 in the Supplementary Material). For these reasons, the subpopulation-level assessments for the Loggerhead Turtle should be given priority in evaluating the true global conservation status of this species. This conclusion follows the precedent for other long-lived, widely distributed species, including the Leatherback Turtle (Wallace <em>et al</em>. 2013).<br/><br/><em><strong>Justification<br/></strong></em>The extent of occurrence and area of occupancy exceeds the thresholds for criterion B, and the population size exceeds the thresholds for criteria C and D. Regarding criterion A, trends were estimated on time series datasets with ≥10 years of data of nesting activities (nest counts) at 153 index nesting sites from six subpopulations out of 10 (North West Atlantic, Mediterranean, South West Atlantic, North West Indian, South West Indian, North Pacific). These six subpopulations comprise about 90% of the current annual nests globally (see Table 2 in the Supplementary Material). The analysis revealed different trends for different subpopulations, with an overall -47% population decrease relative to population size three generations ago, which qualifies for the Vulnerable category (under criterion A2). The species trend at a global scale is basically determined by the two most abundant subpopulations, the North West Atlantic and the North West Indian, which altogether comprise about 75% of the current annual nests. They showed positive and negative trends, respectively. The other four subpopulations for which trends could be calculated show positive trends. For the remaining four subpopulations (comprising about 10% of the current annual nests; North East Atlantic, North East Indian, South East Indian, South Pacific), current trends are unclear, however past negative trends are known or suspected at least for the South Pacific and the North East Atlantic subpopulations respectively.<br/>&#160;<br/>The overall scenario suggests that, on the basis of the current knowledge, the extinction of the species at the global level is highly unlikely to occur in the short and medium term. However, the global status of the species in terms of distribution, number of subpopulations, genetic variability, regional ecological roles, and vulnerability, could change dramatically from the past and current situations. For this reason, the global assessment cannot be considered as an indicator of the true conservation status of the species, and priority should be given to the subpopulation assessments.<br/><br/><em><strong>Assessment Procedure:</strong></em><br/><u>Criterion A</u><br/>For marine turtles, annual counts of nesting females and their nesting activities (more often the latter) are the most frequently recorded and reported abundance metric across index monitoring sites, species, and geographic regions (National Research Council 2010).<br/><br/>To apply criterion A, three generations (or a minimum of ten years, whichever is longer) of abundance data are required (IUCN Standards and Petitions Subcommittee 2014). In the case of the Loggerhead, we conservatively estimate its generation time as 45 years (see the Habitats and Ecology section below). For criterion A, data from three generations ago (~135 years) are necessary to estimate population declines beginning three generations ago up to the present (i.e., assessment) year. The challenges of this requirement on long-lived species like turtles—with generation lengths of 30 years or more—are obvious (see Seminoff and Shanker 2008 for a review). Abundance data from ~135 years ago are not available for Loggerheads anywhere in the world. Extrapolating backward using population trends based on current datasets was considered inappropriate because estimates produced would be biologically unrealistic and unsubstantiated, given what is currently known about sea turtle nesting densities on beaches and other factors (Mrosovsky 2003). In the absence of better information, we assumed that population abundance three generations ago (~135 years, one generation estimated 45 years; see Habitats and Ecology section below) was similar to the first observed abundance rather than to assume that the population has always been in a decline (or increase) of the same magnitude as in the current generation. A similar approach was used in the Red List assessment of another sea turtle species, the Leatherback Turtle (<em>Dermochelys coriacea</em>) (Wallace <em>et al</em>. 2013) and of another long-lived, geographically widespread taxon, the African Elephant (Blanc 2008). Thus, to apply criterion A we assumed that the abundance at the beginning of an available time series dataset had not changed significantly in the preceding three generations, and therefore used the same abundance value in trend calculations. For the Loggerhead global and subpopulation assessments we only considered time series datasets of ≥10 years.<br/><br/>For the global Loggerhead population, we considered time series datasets of 10-50 years, from 153 index nesting sites from six subpopulations (see the individual subpopulation assessments). The index nesting sites included in the analysis are assumed to be representative of their subpopulations, and these six subpopulations comprise about 90% of the current total annual nests (Table 2 in the Supplementary Material).<br/><br/>The assessment under criterion A was conducted in three steps, as follows. Please see the separate subpopulation assessments for further details.<br/><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> We estimated past trends for each of the six individual subpopulations. Specifically, from one past and one recent abundance values (each representing the annual average of five year nest counts) we calculated overall trends (past-present) for each index nesting sites within subpopulations, and then we calculated overall subpopulation past trends for each subpopulation (criteria A1-A2).</li></ul><ul></ul><ul><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> The past and present total abundance values of the six subpopulations (obtained from Step 2) were summed and from these totals the overall population change (past-present) was calculated (Table 3 in the Supplementary Material). </li></ul>Five of the above six subpopulations showed positive trends and one showed a negative trend. Altogether, they showed a negative trend (-47%). The overall negative trend depended on the negative trend of one subpopulation (North West Indian) where criterion A2 was appropriate – i.e. the causes of reduction may not have ceased or may not be understood or may not be reversible. Therefore, the overall trend of the six subpopulations was assessed against criterion A2. The past estimated trend was above the threshold for the Vulnerable category under criterion A2 (30% decline) but below the threshold for the Endangered category (50% decline). Therefore, the Loggerhead Turtle qualifies for the Vulnerable category under criterion A2 and the applicable subcriterion is (b), an index of abundance appropriate to the taxon (counts of nests or tracks).<br/><br/>Although these trends consider only 6 of 10 subpopulations, these subpopulations with sufficient available data account for about 90% of the current global population abundance (Table 2 in the Supplementary Material). Therefore, these trends likely reflect the complete global trend and represent the best information available about the global population trend. Similarly, the global Leatherback Turtle assessment used only five of seven subpopulations to estimate global trends due to lack of sufficient data for two subpopulations (Wallace <em>et al</em>. 2013).<br/><br/><u>Criterion B</u><br/>Since the population area extends over entire oceans around the world, the extent of occurrence (EOO) exceeds the threatened category threshold (20,000 km²). The area of occupancy (AOO) for sea turtles is identified with the nesting beach habitat, which represents the smallest habitat for a critic life stage. Since the appropriate scale for AOO is a grid 2x2 km, the threshold of 2,000 km² corresponds to 1,000 km of linear coastal tract, which is easily exceeded (by orders of magnitude) by the total length of nesting beaches globally. In conclusion, the global population does not trigger any of the thresholds for a threatened category under criterion B.<br/><br/><u>Criterion C</u><br/>To apply criterion C, the number of adults is needed and can be derived from the number of nests per year with the following formula:&#160; Adults = Nests * Nests per female<sup>-1</sup> * Remigration interval * Female proportion<sup>-1</sup>. With a current estimate of annual number of nests of about 200,000, for any reasonable value of the other parameters the population would easily exceed the threshold of 10,000 adults required to qualify for a threatened category under criterion C.<br/><br/><u>Criterion D</u><br/>The number of mature individuals (see criterion C) and AOO value (see criterion B) exceeded the respective thresholds. In conclusion, the population does not trigger any of the thresholds for a threatened category under criterion D.<br/><br/><u>Criterion E</u><br/>Although population viability analyses (PVA) were attempted at subpopulation level (Conant <em>et al</em>. 2009, Van Houtan 2011), in most cases they were not suitable for criterion E under this assessment. No PVA has been attempted at species level and such an approach would also be questionable because the subpopulations are independent units by definition.<br/><br/><strong><em>Sources of Uncertainty</em></strong><br/>Although monitoring of nesting activities by adult female sea turtles is the most common metric recorded and reported across sites and species, globally, there are several disadvantages to using it as a proxy for overall population dynamics, some methodological, some interpretive (National Research Council 2010). First, because nesting females are a very small proportion of a sea turtle population, using abundance of nesting females and their activities as proxies for overall population abundance and trends requires knowledge of other key demographic parameters (several mentioned below) to allow proper interpretation of cryptic trends in nesting abundance (National Research Council 2010). However, there remains great uncertainty about most of these fundamental demographic parameters for Loggerheads, including age at maturity, generation length, survivorship across life stages, adult and hatchling sex ratios, and conversion factors among reproductive parameters (e.g., clutch frequency, nesting success, remigration intervals, etc.). These values can vary within and among subpopulations, further complicating the process of combining subpopulation abundance and trend estimates to obtain global population abundance and trend estimates, and contributing to the uncertainty in these estimates. Second, despite the prevalence of nesting abundance data for marine turtles, monitoring effort and methodologies can vary widely within and across study sites, complicating comparison of nesting count data across years within sites and across different sites as well as robust estimation of population size and trends. However, we have reduced this source of uncertainty by using in the analyses those data sets obtained though standardized monitoring.<br/><br/>For the trend analyses (criterion A) we used data from index rookeries from six populations out of 10. Possible negative past trends associated to high past abundances in the other four subpopulations not included in the analysis could have changed the final result of the assessment (past trends, criterion A2), if such information was available.<br/><br/>For further reading on sources of uncertainty in marine turtle Red List assessments, see Seminoff and Shanker (2008).","The Loggerhead Turtle nests on insular and mainland sandy beaches throughout the temperate and subtropical regions worldwide.

Upon leaving the nesting beach, hatchlings begin an oceanic phase in major current systems (gyres) that serve as open-ocean developmental grounds (Bolten and Witherington 2003, Putman and Mansfield 2015). After 4-19 years in the oceanic zone, Loggerheads recruit to neritic developmental areas rich in benthic prey or epipelagic prey where they forage and grow until maturity at 10–39 years (Avens and Snover 2013). Upon attaining sexual maturity Loggerhead Turtles undertake breeding migrations between foraging grounds and nesting areas at remigration intervals of one to several years with a mean of 2.5–3 years for females (Schroeder <em>et al</em>. 2003) while males would have a shorter remigration interval (e.g., Hays <em>et al</em>. 2010, Wibbels <em>et al</em>. 1990). Migrations are carried out by both males and females and may traverse oceanic zones spanning hundreds to thousands of kilometres (Plotkin 2003). During non-breeding periods adults reside at coastal neritic feeding areas that sometimes coincide with juvenile developmental habitats (Bolten and Witherington 2003).<br/><br/><strong><em>Generation length</em></strong><br/>The IUCN Red List Criteria define generation length to be the average age of parents in a population (i.e., older than the age at maturity and younger than the oldest mature individual) and care should be taken to avoid underestimation (IUCN Standards and Petitions Subcommittee 2014). Although different subpopulations may have different generation length, since this information is limited we adopted the same value for all the subpopulations, taking care to avoid underestimation as recommended by IUCN (IUCN Standards and Petitions Subcommittee 2014).<br/><br/>Loggerheads attain maturity at 10-39 years (Avens and Snover 2013), and we considered here 30 years to be equal or greater than the average age at maturity. Data on reproductive longevity in Loggerheads are limited, but are becoming available with increasing numbers of intensively monitored, long-term projects on protected beaches. Tagging studies have documented reproductive histories up to 28 years in the North Western Atlantic Ocean (Mote Marine Laboratory, unpubl. data), up to 18 years in the South Western Indian Ocean (Nel <em>et al</em>. 2013), up to 32 years in the South Western Atlantic Ocean (Projeto Tamar unpubl. data), and up to 37 years in the South Western Pacific Ocean, where females nesting for 20-25 years are common (C. Limpus, pers. comm). We considered 15 years to be equal or greater than the average reproductive longevity. Therefore, we considered here 45 years to be equal or greater than the average generation length, therefore avoiding underestimation as recommended by IUCN (IUCN Standards and Petitions Subcommittee 2014).","Threats to Loggerheads vary in time and space, and in relative impact to populations. Threat categories affecting marine turtles, including Loggerheads, were described by Wallace <em>et al</em>. (2011) as:<br/><ol><li>Fisheries bycatch: incidental capture of marine turtles in fishing gear targeting other species;</li><li>Take: direct utilization of turtles or eggs for human use (i.e., consumption, commercial products);</li><li>Coastal Development affecting critical turtle habitat: human-induced alteration of coastal environments due to construction, dredging, beach modification, etc;</li><li>Pollution and Pathogens: marine pollution and debris that affect marine turtles (i.e., through ingestion or entanglement, disorientation caused by artificial lights), as well as impacts of pervasive pathogens (for example fibropapilloma virus) on turtle health;</li><li>Climate change: current and future impacts from climate change on marine turtles and their habitats (increasing sand temperatures on nesting beaches affecting hatchling sex ratios, sea level rise, storm frequency and intensity affecting nesting habitats, etc.).</li><li>The relative impacts of individual threats to all Loggerhead subpopulations were assessed by by Wallace <em>et al</em>. (2011). Fisheries bycatch was classified as the highest threat to Loggerheads globally, followed by coastal development and human consumption of eggs, meat, or other products. Due to lack of information, pollution and pathogens was only scored as affecting three subpopulations and climate change was only scored for two subpopulations. Enhanced efforts to assess and reduce the impacts of these threats on Loggerheads—and other marine turtle species—should be a high priority for future conservation efforts. </li></ol>More detailed information at regional level can found in the specific subpopulation assessments.","Loggerheads are a single species globally comprising 10 biologically described regional management units (RMUs; Wallace <em>et al</em>. 2010) – hereafter subpopulations - which describe biologically and geographically explicit population segments by integrating information from nesting sites, mitochondrial and nuclear DNA studies, movements and habitat use by all life stages. Regional management units are functionally equivalent to IUCN subpopulations, thus providing the appropriate demographic unit for Red List assessments. There are 10 Loggerhead subpopulations: NorthWest Atlantic Ocean, North East Atlantic Ocean, South West Atlantic Ocean, Mediterranean Sea, North East Indian Ocean, North West Indian Ocean, South East Indian Ocean, South West Indian Ocean, North Pacific Ocean, and South Pacific Ocean (see Figure 2 in the Supplementary Material). Multiple genetic stocks have been defined according to geographically disparate nesting areas around the world and are included within RMU delineations (Wallace <em>et al</em>. 2010)  (shapefiles can be viewed and downloaded at: <a href=""http://seamap.env.duke.edu/swot"">http://seamap.env.duke.edu/swot</a>).<br/><br/>Total population size is unknown. The most common proxy for population abundance in sea turtles is the annual number of nests. A total of about 200,000 clutches are laid annually by the 10 subpopulations altogether (see Table 2 in the Supplementary Material). Considering a range of 3 to 5.5 clutches per female, the above value would correspond to approximately 36,000-67,000 nesting females annually.",Decreasing,"The Loggerhead Turtle is globally distributed throughout the subtropical and temperate regions of the Mediterranean Sea and Pacific, Indian, and Atlantic Oceans (Wallace <em>et al</em>. 2010) (see Figure 1 in the Supplementary Material).","Loggerhead Turtles and their eggs are taken for human use (i.e., consumption and commercial products).",Terrestrial|Marine,"Loggerhead Turtles are afforded legislative protection under a number of treaties and laws (Wold 2002). Annex II of the SPAW Protocol to the Cartagena Convention (a protocol concerning specially protected areas and wildlife); Appendix I of CITES (Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora); and Appendices I and II of the Convention on Migratory Species (CMS). A partial list of the International Instruments that benefit Loggerhead Turtles includes the Inter-American Convention for the Protection and Conservation of Sea Turtles, the Memorandum of Understanding on the Conservation and Management of Marine Turtles and their Habitats of the Indian Ocean and South-East Asia (IOSEA), the Memorandum of Understanding on ASEAN Sea Turtle Conservation and Protection, the Memorandum of Agreement on the Turtle Islands Heritage Protected Area (TIHPA), and the Memorandum of Understanding Concerning Conservation Measures for Marine Turtles of the Atlantic Coast of Africa.<br/><br/>As a result of these designations and agreements, many of the intentional impacts directed at sea turtles have been lessened: harvest of eggs and adults has been slowed at several nesting areas through nesting beach conservation efforts and an increasing number of community-based initiatives are in place to slow the take of turtles in foraging areas. In regard to incidental take, the implementation of Turtle Excluder Devices has proved to be beneficial in some areas, primarily in the United States and South and Central America (National Research Council 1990). Guidelines are available to reduce sea turtle mortality in fishing operations in coastal and high seas fisheries (FAO 2009). However, despite these advances, human impacts continue throughout the world. In most areas, the lack of effective monitoring in pelagic and near-shore fisheries operations still allows substantial direct and indirect mortality, and the uncontrolled development of coastal and marine habitats threatens to destroy the supporting ecosystems of long-lived Loggerhead Turtles.<br/><br/>More detailed information at regional level can be found in the specific subpopulation assessments.",Afrotropical|Australasian|Indomalayan|Nearctic|Neotropical|Palearctic,,false,false,Global

This species has low biological productivity with small litters and a biennial reproductive cycle. It is caught as target and bycatch in coastal and pelagic commercial and small-scale longline, purse seine, and gillnet fisheries, and is often retained for its meat as well as fins. The population appeared to be stable at relatively high levels of abundance during the 1990s and early 2000s. Since cessation of an open ocean gillnet fishery in the early 1990s, the population may be rebuilding. There is no information available on population trends since that time, except an anecdotal note by recreational fishers of a decline in catch in Prince William Sound, Alaska that resulted in a self-imposed avoidance of this species. Other than this noted decline in Alaska, there is nothing to infer population decline and thus, the species is assessed as Least Concern.

The Salmon Shark has a moderate annual rate of population increase for the Northeast Pacific of 0.081, which is similar to that of the North Atlantic congener Porbeagle (<em>Lamna nasus</em>) (Dulvy <em>et al</em>. 2008).","<p>The Salmon Shark is primarily taken as bycatch in commercial and small-scale pelagic longline, purse seine, and gillnet fisheries operating in offshore and high-seas waters (Goldman and Musick 2008, Murua <em>et al. </em>2013). It may also be captured in coastal longlines, gillnets, trammel nets and sometimes trawls, as well as by rod and reel, particularly in areas with narrow continental shelves (Camhi <em>et al.</em> 2008). The Salmon Shark was historically taken in the 1950s and 1960s in relatively large numbers (105,000–155,000 individuals per year) in open ocean gillnet fisheries that ceased operating in the early 1990s (Goldman and Musick 2008). <br/></p>  <p>Salmon Sharks are sometimes retained for their meat and fins (Cardeñosa <em>et al.</em> 2018, Fields&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018)<em>. </em>Under-reporting of catches in the pelagic and domestic fisheries is likely (Dent and Clarke 2015).<em> </em>The species is currently targeted by recreational fishers, and although many practice catch and release, recreational fishing could be a threat due to post-release mortality. Post-release mortality has been reported as 10–75% on longlines for the closely-related Porbeagle&#160;(Campana <em>et al. </em>2016).<strong>&#160;</strong></p>","There are no data available on the genetic stock structure of the Salmon Shark. Although a highly migratory shark, the degree of mixing between the Northeast and Northwest Pacific is unknown (Hulbert <em>et al.</em> 2005, Weng 2008, Conrath <em>et al.</em> 2014). <br/><br/>The population size of the Salmon Shark was estimated to be  16,600,000–21,900,000 individuals in 1989 (Shimida and Nakano unpubl.  data, cited in Nagasawa 1998), however,  no information was provided on how these estimates were derived. The Salmon Shark was historically taken in the 1950s and 1960s in relatively large numbers, but since those fisheries ceased in the 1990s, it appears fishing mortality of Salmon Shark in the open ocean has reduced and the population could be rebuilding (Goldman and Musick 2008). Based on landings data in Japan, the population of Salmon Sharks was considered stable in the Northwest Pacific from 1985 to 1995 (Nagasawa 1998). Demographic analysis indicated that in the early 2000s, the population of Salmon Shark was stable across the Northeast and Northwest Pacific, but that Salmon Sharks are vulnerable to fishing mortality (Goldman 2002). Anecdotal information by recreational fishers notes a decline in recreational catch during 2009–2010 in Prince William Sound, Alaska, but no further information is available (Orion Charters 2017). No additional information or data are available on population trends across the range of the species.",Stable,"The Salmon Shark is wide-ranging throughout the North and Central Pacific, ranging north to ~65°N and south to ~30°N (Goldman and Musick 2008, Ebert <em>et al.</em> 2013).","<p>The species is used for its meat and fins (Goldman and Musick 2008, Fields<em>&#160;et al.&#160;</em>2018, Cardeñosa&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2018).

It is demersal on the continental shelves at depths of 41–70 m. The species is a bycatch in industrial and artisanal fisheries with multiple fishing gears including trawl, gillnet, and longline. It is mostly discarded due to its small size with a likely low post release survival rate. It is considered common in Viet Nam and rare in Taiwan. Inferred and suspected declines over the past three generation lengths (15 years) range from 23–97%, although across most of its range the declines are 23–46% and across most of that area, fishing pressure is high. Based on inferred declines across most of its range, it is suspected that the Shortlip Numbfish&#160;has undergone a population reduction of 30–49% over the past three generation lengths (15 years) due to levels of exploitation, and it is assessed as Vulnerable A2d.","The Shortlip Numbfish&#160;is demersal on the continental shelf at depths of 41–70 m (Weigmann 2016). It reaches a maximum size of 32 cm total length (TL), though is usually smaller at 25 cm TL; males mature at ~23 cm TL and female size-at-maturity is unknown (de Carvalho 1999, Last <em>et al</em>. 2016). Reproduction is presumably aplacental viviparous, based on other <em>Narcine </em>species, with size-at-birth of ~8 cm TL (Last <em>et al. </em>2016). Nothing else is known of its biology. Age parameters are unknown but can be inferred from the only species of numbfish with age data, the Cortez Numbfish (<em>Narcine entemedor</em>) that has a female age-at-maturity of 6 years and a maximum age of 15 years, resulting in a generation length of 10.5 years (Villavicencio-Garayzar 2000). The Cortez Numbfish is larger than the Shortlip Numbfish (75 vs 32 cm TL) and thus based on scaled-size, the generation length is inferred as 5 years for the Shortlip Numbfish. This is an estimate only and research is required on the age parameters of this species.","<p>This species is subject to fishing pressure across its range. It is taken as bycatch in industrial and artisanal fisheries with multiple fishing gears including trawl, gillnet, and longline. It is likely mostly discarded due to its small size that make it unsuitable for human consumption or fish meal (H. Ho unpubl. data 2019), but is possibly retained for local consumption and 'trash fish' in Malaysia and Cambodia (A. Bin Ali pers. comm. 05/05/2020). Post release survival is likely low, as <em>Narcine </em>species are soft bodied and easily damaged (de Carvalho <em>et al</em>. 2009).<br/><br/>The northern South China Sea has been heavily over-exploited, with fish stocks having declined by over 70% in the inshore, offshore and outer shelf areas between the 1960s and 1990s (Wang and Yuan 2008). Across China, the number of powered fishing vessels increased from ~10,000 in the late 1960s to ~200,000 in the mid-1990s, along with an increase in vessel size and more modern fishing gear. Since 1989, the catch-per-unit effort of fish stocks has steadily decreased and large, highly valued species have been replaced by small, less valuable species, with most of the catch now used as feed in aquaculture (MacKinnon <em>et al.</em> 2012).<br/><br/>In Taiwan, by the 1950s the coastal fisheries were considered overfished. The fisheries catch within the Taiwan EEZ continued to rise from the 1950s until 1980, after which it steadily declined (Kuo and Booth 2011). The number of powered vessels operating in Taiwan’s EEZ significantly increased from the 1950s (3,215 vessels) to the late 1980s (peaked in 1989s at 15,900), and then slowly decreased to 11,200 vessels in 2017 (Huang and Chuang 2010, Liao <em>et al</em>. 2019, H. Hsu Taiwan National Fisheries Statistics unpubl. data 2019). The artisanal fishing effort has steadily and markedly declined for non-powered sampans (8,283–239 from 1956 to 2004), but remains steady for fishing rafts (14,273<a name=""_Hlk20734780"">–</a>12,984 from 1956 to 2004) (H. Hsu, Taiwan National Fisheries Statistics unpubl. data 2019).<br/><br/>Most marine stocks in Viet Nam have been declining since the 1990s and are now considered fully or over-exploited with a lack of adequate enforcement leading to essentially unregulated fisheries (Teh e<em>t al.</em> 2014a, FAO 2020). The fleet is dominated by small-scale artisanal and subsistence fisheries that have accounted for 60–85% of the fleet since the 1950s (Teh <em>et al.</em> 2014a, Pauly <em>et al.</em> 2020). The artisanal and subsistence motorized fleet has tripled from 1950 (~24,280 vessels) to 2014 (~ 78,000 vessels) but has also substantially increased in effort in terms of engine power, particularly over the last two decades (Pauly<em> et al.</em> 2020). Approximately 33% of the total marine captures in Viet Nam consists of ‘trash’ fish that are too small for human consumption but are still retained to produce fish meal feed for the aquaculture industry and also to manufacture fish sauce (FAO 2020). Illegal fishing by foreign vessels is an additional threat in Viet Nam waters (Teh <em>et al.</em> 2014a, FAO 2020). In Malaysia, this species is taken regularly as bycatch of demersal trawls (Last<em> et al.</em> 2010). Unrestrained fisheries expansion from the mid-1960s to the 70s led to fully exploited  inshore fisheries by the late 1970s (Teh and Teh 2014). Fishing effort  in Malaysia has been increasing since 1950 across subsistence, artisanal  and industrial fisheries (Pauly <em>et al. </em>2020). The number of  vessels across all sectors has tripled in Sarawak from 2,251 vessels in  1950 to 7,650 vessels in 2014, with fishing effort in Sabah also rising,  particularly in artisanal fisheries (Teh <em>et al.</em> 2009, Pauly <em>et al.</em> 2020).<br/><br/>Coastal fisheries in Cambodia are considered overexploited (Teh<em> et al.</em> 2014b). Fishing effort has been increasing since 1950 across subsistence, artisanal and industrial fisheries (Pauly <em>et al.</em> 2020). The number of vessels across all sectors has increased substantially from 26,180 vessels in 1950 to 108,490 vessels in 2014, with most of the increase since the 1980s and most of the fleet artisanal fisheries (Pauly <em>et al.</em> 2020). Trawlers are the dominant fishery accounting for one-quarter to one-third of the Cambodian fishing fleet (Teh <em>et al.</em> 2014b, Pauly <em>et al.</em> 2020). Most fisheries in Thailand are overexploited. Fishing effort has been  increasing since 1950 across subsistence, artisanal and industrial  fisheries (Pauly<em> et al.</em> 2020). The number of vessels across all  sectors has increased dramatically from 5,900 vessels in 1950 to a peak  of 82,900 vessels in 2004 and then declined steadily to 54,700 vessels  in 2014 (Pauly<em> et al</em>. 2020).<br/><br/>In Myanmar, rays are largely taken as incidental catch in coastal gillnets, trawls, and hookah divers spearing at night (Howard<em> et al.</em> 2015, Mizrahi <em>et al.</em> 2020). These inshore fisheries are relatively small-scale, and include many subsistence level fishers. Fishing effort has been increasing since 1950 across subsistence, artisanal and industrial fisheries (Pauly <em>et al.</em> 2020). The number of vessels across all sectors has increased substantially from 2,000 vessels in 1950 to 125,222 vessels in 2014, with &gt;80% of the fleet subsistence fisheries operating in coastal waters on the continental shelf (Pauly <em>et al. </em>2020). Bangladesh has a substantial artisanal fishing fleet that operates throughout the coastal regions. In 2017–2018 there were 67,669 vessels reported to be operating (DoF 2018). All benthic rays in Bangladesh are targeted with non-baited demersal longlines (1–10 km) with 10,000–30,000 hooks that operate in 5–40 m depth and <em>Narcine</em> species are captured in this target fishery (A. Haque unpubl. data 2020). Anecdotal reports indicate a steep decline in rays over the past 10 years, with a decline in landings of <em>Narcine </em>species also noted over the past 10 years (Ullah&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2014, A. Haque pers. comm. 05/05/2020). This decline is concurrent with steep increases in artisanal and subsistence fisheries effort (Pauly<em> et al.</em> 2020). The artisanal fishing vessels land &gt;90% of the total marine catch and generally operate inshore at depths of 0–40 m but can operate to 80 m (Hoq <em>et al.</em> 2014, A. Haque pers. comm. 05/05/2020). </p>  <p></p>","<p>There is no species-specific catch data for this species from any part of its range. It is common in Viet Nam and rare in Taiwan and Myanmar (Lin 2010, Ebert <em>et al. </em>2013, H. Ho, A. Maung and V. Vo unpubl. data 2020). Catches of sharks, rays, and skates from 1950 to 2014 have been reconstructed for the China, Viet Nam, Borneo, Cambodia, and Myanmar Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZ), based on landings data (Pauly <em>et al.</em> 2020). Although landings data are not a direct measure of abundance, these can be used to infer population reduction where landings have decreased while fishing effort has remained stable or increased. In China, the reconstructed catch data showed a 67% decline in landings over the 65 years (Pauly<em> et al. </em>2020). The decline was from around 90,000 t annually in the early 1950s to around 30,000 t in 2014. Across China, fishing effort has increased substantially since the 1950s and continues to increase, despite efforts by the Chinese government since the 1980s to restrict effort in response to depletion of inshore fisheries resources (Pauly and Liang 2019). <br/><br/>In Viet Nam, reconstructed landings data showed a 97% decline in landings over 29 years from 1986 to 2014. Catches gradually rose from 1,560 t in 1950 to ~44,000 t per year in the mid-1960s, fluctuated and then rose steeply during the early-1980s to a peak of 466,445 t in 1986 followed by a fairly steady decline to 14,750 t in 2014 (Pauly <em>et al.</em> 2020). These declines in landings can be inferred to represent reductions in their populations, as the fishing effort has increased substantially since the 1950s and was increasing during the period of a decline in landings (Pauly<em> et al. </em>2020). In Sarawak, reconstructed landings showed a 50% decline from a peak of 14,690 t in 1997 to 7,300 t in 2014 (Pauly <em>et al.</em>  2020). Landings slowly increased from the 1950s to 1980, dropped then  peaked again in 1995–1997 before sharply declining. In Sabah,  reconstructed landings showed a 37% decline from a peak of ~27,000 t in  1998 to 17,000 t in 2014 (Pauly <em>et al. </em>2020). Fishing pressure  has been increasing since the&#160;1950s and thus the declines infer  reductions in these populations in Sarawak and Sabah.<br/><br/>In Cambodia, reconstructed landings showed a 91% reduction over 12 years from 2003 to 2014. Catches rose steeply from 1950 to a peak of 4,550 t in 1970, dropped sharply then rose over two decades to another peak catch of 3,914 t in 2003 followed by a sharp decline in catches to 335 t in 2014 (Pauly<em> et al. </em>2020). These declines in landings can be inferred to represent reductions in their populations, as the fishing effort was increasing during the period of a decline in landings (Teh <em>et al. </em>2014b, Pauly <em>et al.</em> 2020). In Myanmar, reconstructed landings from 1950 to  the late 1990s varied between 15,000 t to 35,000 t annually with no  substantial trend. From the late 1990s to 2014 landings increased to  around 40,000 t per year which was concurrent with an increase in  fishing effort (Pauly <em>et al</em>. 2020). This infers there has been  no significant reduction in the shark and ray populations as landings  have increased as effort has increased. However, surveys in recent years  have revealed reductions in some shark and ray populations (San San Khine 2010, Krakstad <em>et al.</em> 2014).<br/><br/>In Taiwan, although there is no species-specific data, the catch-per-unit effort for all rays has remained stable over 17 years, that is, 1997–2013 (H. Hsu, Taiwan National Fisheries Statistics unpubl. data 2019). In Thailand, landings data are available on all combined ray species  from the EEZ for 1998–2018 (Krajangdara 2019). The landings  data showed an 89% reduction over 16 years from 2003 to 2018. Catches rose  steadily from 1998 to a peak catch of 18,131 t in 2003 followed by a  steady decline in catches to ~2000 t in 2018 (Krajangdara 2019). It is  difficult to infer a population trend as the decline in catches from 2003 to 2018 coincided with a decline in fishing effort.<br/><br/>When these inferred declines are scaled to three generation lengths of the Shortlip Numbfish (15 years), they represent declines of 23%, 85%, 46%, 35%, and 97% in China, Viet Nam, Sarawak, Sabah, and Cambodia, respectively. These levels of declines are not species-specific but are informative for understanding the broader levels of decline in batoids in the region. The declines range from 23–97%, although across most of the species’  range the declines are 23–46%. Historic and current fishing pressure (‘actual levels of exploitation’) is high across most of the range of the Shortlip Numbfish. Overall, based on inferred declines across most of its range, it is suspected that the species has undergone a population reduction of 30–49% over the past three generation lengths (15 years).</p>",Decreasing,"The Shortlip Numbfish&#160;is found from the South China Sea to the Bay of Bengal in the Northwest and Western Central Pacific and Eastern Indian Oceans. It occurs from China to Bangladesh, including Taiwan, Viet Nam, Cambodia, Thailand, Borneo (Malaysia), Myanmar, and Bangladesh (Last <em>et al.</em> 2010, Last <em>et al.</em> 2016).","In Borneo, this species is consumed but is considered low grade and it is also used for fish meal (Last <em>et al.</em> 2010). Elsewhere, based on cogeneric and sympatric <em>Narcin</em>e species, the Shortlip Numbfish&#160;is likely not used for human consumption as there is very little meat on the animal, except for Cambodia where small individuals may be consumed (A. Bin Ali pers. comm. 05/05/2020). In Bangladesh, <em>Narcine</em> species are generally discarded at sea as fishers fear being electrocuted by them (A. Haque unpubl. data 2020). In China and Taiwan, it is retained but discarded at the markets as it is unsuitable for fish meal in those countries; it may sometimes be consumed by fishers at sea in Taiwan (H. Hsu unpubl. data 2019). In Malaysia, and for small individuals in Cambodia, it is likely used for 'trash fish' (A. Bin Ali pers. comm. 05/05/2020), that is, fish meal and other products.",Marine,"<p>No specific conservation measures are in place. In China, since the late 1990s, regulations have specified varying annual seasonal fishing closures on commercial demersal trawling in the South China Seas to 12⁰N (Yu and Yu 2008). The closure times have varied over the years and between regions, but most now commence in May and are in place for 3–4 months. In 2018, this seasonal closure was widened to also include all other commercial fishing gears (e.g. gillnet and longline) with the only exception being for rod and reel to allow small-scale artisanal fisheries and recreational fisheries (J. Zhang pers. comm. 28/08/2019). In Taiwan, since 1999, all demersal trawling is prohibited within three  nautical miles (nm) of the coast and within 12 nm for trawlers larger  than 50 Gross Registered Tonnage (Fisheries Agency 2019, Liao <em>et al.</em> 2019). <br/><br/>In Malaysia, large mesh gillnets (&gt;24.5 cm) were banned in 1990 (A. Bin Ali pers. comm. 05/05 2020). In Myanmar, two shark reserves were designated in the Myeik Archipelago in 2004 where targeting sharks and rays is prohibited (Notification 2/2004) (Howard <em>et al.</em> 2015). In 2008, a nationwide ban on the targeting of sharks was announced. Despite the nationwide ban, sharks and rays continue to be captured in large numbers, partly because there is little or no enforcement, and little knowledge of the ban in fishing communities (T. MacKeracher,&#160;pers. comm. 02/04/2020). Research is required to better define the population size and trends, and life history of the Shortlip Numbfish, and catch rates should be monitored.&#160;</p>","",,false,false,Global

130482064,2475,Balaenoptera borealis,Endangered,A1abd,2018,2018-06-25 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<p>The cause of the population reduction in Sei Whales (commercial whaling) that occurred in the 20<sup>th</sup> century is reversible and is understood and has been brought under control. For this reason, the species is assessed under IUCN Red List criterion A1, not under A2, A3, or A4. The three-generation time period for applying criterion A is 70 years. Following the end of large-scale whaling in the late 1970s, some recovery of the population is inferred based on standard assumptions about the population dynamics. Recent abundance estimates for Sei Whales from the North Pacific are consistent with the inferred rate of recovery. There is little direct evidence of recovery in the Southern Hemisphere where the greatest declines occurred, but there has also been little monitoring effort there, and the recovery predicted by the population model is assumed. The species has been listed as Endangered, but plausible projections of the population size indicate that the global population of&#160;mature animals&#160;may have recovered to around 30% of the 1948 level by 2018. The corresponding extent of reduction, at 70%, is at the borderline between Endangered and Vulnerable under criterion A1. In view of the Red List rule that taxa should remain in a higher category of threat for five years after ceasing to meet the criteria for that category, the species remains classified as Endangered, but should be re-evaluated in five years, at which time it can be reclassified to Vulnerable unless new data cast doubt on the predicted recovery.</p>","<p></p><p>  </p><p>Sei Whales exhibit a greater variety in diet than some other large whales such as Blue Whales (<em>Balaenoptera musculus</em>), but tend to feed on only one type of prey at a time. Whale stomachs examined in the northeastern Atlantic contained copepods and euphausiids (Jonsgård and Darling 1977). Of 21,713 stomachs examined from pelagic catches in the North Pacific during 1952-71, 82.7% contained copepods only and 12.6% contained euphausiids only (Nemoto and Kawamura 1977). Sei Whale stomachs analysed in the eastern North Pacific off California contained euphausiids and anchovies (Rice 1977) and off British Colombia they fed primarily on copepods in some years and euphausiids or fish in other years (Flinn <em>et al</em>. 2002). Stomachs of Sei Whales taken by Soviet operations in the western North Pacific included copepods and euphausiids, as well as Anchovy, Sardine, Saury, Walleye Pollock, Mackerel, Capelin, and squid (Shuntov and Ivanov 2015). Some of these prey items plus euphausiids were also found in stomachs of Sei Whales taken in Japanese operations in the northwest Pacific in 2009 (Watanabe <em>et al</em>. 2012). Of 31,494 stomachs examined in the Southern Hemisphere during 1961-66, 54.3% contained euphausiids only, 30.5% contained copepods only, and 14.4% contained amphipods only (Nemoto and Kawamura 1977).<br/><br/>Studies have shown a clear differentiation between Sei Whale and Bryde’s Whale habitats in the western North Pacific, where each species favoured different ranges in sea surface temperatures and related covariates, Sei Whales being found in areas with lower sea surface temperatures (Sasaki <em>et al.</em> 2013, Murase <em>et al</em>. 2014). However, in other parts of the world Sei and Brydes Whales have been found to be sympatric in the same season (Gallardo <em>et al</em>. 1983).&#160;</p>  <p></p>","<p>Sei Whale exploitation by modern whaling was particularly intensive in the Southern Hemisphere and the North Pacific from the late 1950s to the mid-1970s, following the depletion of Blue, Fin (<em>Balaenoptera physalus</em>) and Humpback (<em>Megaptera novaeangliae</em>) Whales. Sei Whale stocks were seriously depleted during this period. Exploitation in the North Atlantic occurred over a longer period and was less intensive, except in the eastern North Atlantic, where the population appears not to have recovered from early modern whaling. Commercial exploitation ceased in the North Pacific in 1975, in the Southern Hemisphere in 1979 and in the North Atlantic in 1989 (Thomas <em>et al</em>. 2016). Catches by Japan under scientific permit resumed in the North Pacific in 2002. From 2004-2013, the annual take was 100 animals and was increased to 134 per year from 2017. The IWC Scientific Committee has advised that this level of take will not harm the stock (IWC 2018c).<br/><br/>There are records of ship strikes and entanglements involving Sei Whales (Brownell <em>et al</em>. 2009, Henry <em>et al.</em> 2014), but it is unclear whether they constitute a significant source of mortality. Because of the Sei Whale’s offshore distribution, most ship strikes could go unnoticed.<br/><br/>Rice (1961, 1974) reported a pathological condition in several North Pacific Sei Whales that resulted in deterioration or loss of baleen; however, the current frequency of this condition, and its impact (if any) on the population, are unknown.<br/><br/>An unusual mass mortality of at least 343 Sei Whales that occurred in southern Chile in March 2015 is still under investigation but may have been caused by a harmful algal bloom associated with a developing El Niño event, the frequency of which can be expected to increase as the Pacific Ocean warms (Häussermann<em> et al.</em> 2017).</p>  <p></p>","<p><em><strong>North Atlantic</strong></em><br/>The International Whaling Commission (IWC) recognizes three stock divisions for Sei Whales in the North Atlantic: Nova Scotia (including the waters off the east coast of the U.S.A.); Iceland-Denmark Strait; and Eastern (including the waters of Spain, Portugal, British Isles, Faroes, and Norway), but the divisions were chosen on largely arbitrary grounds (Donovan 1991). The West-Greenland-Labrador Sea area is not assigned to a stock division, but Sei Whales are present there. Genetic comparisons of Sei Whales from different North Atlantic locations found no evidence for population structure but did not rule it out (Huijser <em>et al</em>. 2018).<br/><br/>About 17,000 Sei Whales were recorded caught by modern whaling in the North Atlantic (Allison 2017). In addition, a proportion of the approximately 13,000 unspecified large whales caught in the North Atlantic in the late 19th and early 20th centuries would have been Sei Whales, given that the specified catch in the same areas in the following years included Sei Whales. Sei Whales appear to have been depleted in the eastern North Atlantic, with nearly 10,000 recorded taken in Norwegian and British waters prior to 1940 (not counting unspecified whales), but fewer than 250 since then. The species seems to be virtually absent there now: Norwegian surveys of northeast Atlantic waters in 1987, 1989, and annually from 1995–2009 have yielded only two Sei Whale sightings (NAMMCO 2010).<br/> <br/> A summer 2007 survey of the European Atlantic (an area west of British Isles, and Biscaya, northwestern Spain) yielded an estimate of 366 (coefficient of variation (CV) 0.33) Sei Whales (Macleod <em>et al</em>. 2009). No Sei Whales were seen in surveys on the North Sea (Hammond <em>et al</em>. 2017). By contrast, Sei Whales are still abundant in the central North Atlantic (Iceland-Denmark Strait IWC stock area), especially southwest of Iceland south to 50°N in summer. The only survey with reasonably complete coverage and designed specifically for the purpose of estimating Sei Whale abundance was in 1989, and yielded a population estimate of 10,300 (CV 0.27) (Cattanach <em>et al</em>. 1993). Areas of Sei Whale summer abundance seem to shift markedly between years, more so than for other baleen whale species (Gunnlaugsson <em>et al</em>. 2004). Sei Whales were among the most commonly sighted whales in a 2004 summer survey in the mid-Atlantic Ridge region, with a total of 53 sightings (Waring <em>et al</em>. 2008). The 2007 Trans-NASS survey yielded an estimate of ~5,000 (CV ~0.5) Sei Whales but covered a smaller area than the 1989 survey (Pike <em>et al</em>. 2010). Surveys of U.S. and southern Nova Scotian waters during 2010-14 yielded an estimate of 919 (CV 0.31) Sei Whales averaged (with inverse variance weighting) over spring, summer, and fall, or 849 (CV 0.42) whales in summer only (Palka <em>et al</em>. 2017). These estimates are similar to the estimate of 870 Sei Whales obtained by Chapman and Mitchell (1977) from data collected in this area during 1966-69. About 1,200 Sei Whales were taken off Nova Scotia during 1962–72. Surveys of Atlantic Canadian waters in 2007 yielded just two Sei Whale sightings, too few to estimate abundance (Lawson and Gosselin 2009). Chapman and Mitchell (1977) estimated the abundance in the Labrador Sea-West Greenland area at 965.&#160; <br/> <br/> <em><strong>North Pacific</strong></em><em></em><br/>The last stock assessment of North Pacific Sei Whales by the IWC Scientific Committee was in 1974 (IWC 1977). The “exploitable” population (animals of legally catchable size) was estimated to have declined from 42,000 in 1963 to 8,600 in 1974 (Tillman 1977). Over 40,000 Sei Whales were caught during this period, out of a total of about 70,000 taken in the North Pacific since the start of modern whaling at the beginning of the 20th century (Allison 2017). A 75% reduction in Sei Whale catch rates at California whaling stations during the 1960s is consistent with an ocean-wide decline (Rice 1977).<br/><br/>From sighting surveys conducted under the IWC POWER programme in July and August 2010-2012, Hakamada <em>et al</em>. (2017) estimated 29,632 (CV 0.24) Sei Whales in the area east of 170°E. To this can be added an estimate of 5,086 (CV 0.38) obtained from national surveys west of 170°E in the same months in 2008 (Hakamada and Matsuoka 2016), giving a total of about 35,000 Sei Whales.<br/> <br/> Assuming that the population was about 50% “exploitable” when commercial whaling ceased in 1975, the recent abundance estimate (2008-12, see above) would correspond roughly to a doubling of the population over the 35-year intervening period, representing a recovery rate of about 2% per year. Thus, the older and newer abundance estimates appear to be broadly compatible (see Supplementary Materials), but the relatively simple analysis of catch and whaling effort data by Tillman (1977) is no longer an accepted method to obtain abundance estimates.<br/> <br/> Sei Whales appear to have been reasonably common in the eastern North Pacific, with over 2,800 taken off Vancouver Island, Canada between 1948 and 1967 (Allison 2017) and 384 whales taken by Californian whalers between 1958 and 1971 (Rice 1977). The estimated abundance for the U.S. west coast was only 56 whales from surveys in 1996 and 2001 (Barlow 2003), but this has increased to 519 whales (CV 0.40) from surveys in 2008 and 2014 (Barlow 2016).<br/> <br/> <em><strong>Southern Hemisphere</strong></em><br/>The IWC arbitrarily divides Southern Hemisphere Sei Whales, along with other Southern Hemisphere baleen whales, into six longitudinally defined management areas. Sei Whales in all six areas have been classified as Protection Stocks by the IWC since 1978. Over 200,000 Sei Whales were recorded taken by modern whaling in the Southern Hemisphere during 1905–1979. The largest catches were during 1960–72, when they exceeded 5,000 in every year, and exceeded 20,000 in each of the 1964/65 and 1965/66 seasons. Most catches were taken in summer by pelagic fleets operating south of 40°S, but winter catches were also taken from land stations in Brazil, Chile, and South Africa (Allison 2017). The catches by the former Soviet Union were grossly underreported at the time: 33,000 Sei Whales were reported taken during 1950-78, but subsequently records totalling nearly 60,000 were found and are included in the above figures (Ivashchenko <em>et al</em>. 2011).<br/><br/>The last assessment of Southern Hemisphere Sei Whales by the IWC Scientific Committee was conducted in 1979 (IWC 1980). Some extra information on these assessments is given by Horwood (1987). Based on catches/sightings per unit effort from Japanese catch and scouting vessels, the “exploitable” stock size (whales of legal size, approximately 2/3 of total population), excluding Area II (South Atlantic sector), was estimated to have declined from about 64,000 in 1960 to about 11,000 by 1979. The population assessment method failed to produce an estimate for Area II, because nearly all the catch for this area was taken in just two seasons (1964/65 and 1965/66), yet the abundance indices suggested a more continuous decline during the 1960s and 1970s (IWC 1980). This suggests that whales move between management areas, and that these areas do not correspond to demographically distinct populations.<br/> <br/> Other available evidence also suggests a severe and rapid decline in Sei Whale stocks during the 1960s and 1970s. The catch and sighting rates from winter whaling operations off Brazil and South Africa show very sharp declines. Abundance indices from the Brazilian whaling ground for Sei Whales during 1966–81 (da Rocha 1983) declined by about 90% during 1966–72. Catch and sightings indices off Durban, South Africa for 1965–74 (Best 1976) declined by over 95%. Tag-recapture data from pelagic whaling suggested an approximately six-fold decline between 1962 and 1976 (IWC 1980).<br/> <br/> IWC (1996) gives a total population estimate for Sei Whales south of 30°S in summer of about 10,000 in 1983 based on a combination of International Decade of Cetacean Research (IDCR) and Japanese Scouting Vessel (JSV) sightings data. It is difficult to know how much reliance to place on this estimate because no variance is given, but it is consistent with a severe decline. No more recent data covering a wide area are available, except for the area south of 60°S, which is outside the main range of Sei Whales. In the absence of dedicated surveys in Sei Whale habitat, and corresponding abundance estimates, it is not possible to verify whether there has been any increase in Southern Hemisphere Sei Whales since the cessation of whaling.<br/> <br/> Because of the erratic local appearance of Sei Whales, recovery is hard to detect from observations collected in limited areas. No recovery of Sei Whales in Brazilian waters has been detected since their depletion (Zerbini <em>et al</em>. 1997, Andriolo <em>et al</em>. 2010), but Iñíguez <em>et al. </em>(2010) reported on a possible slow recovery of Sei Whales in the southwestern Atlantic based on land and aerial sightings in Argentina. <br/> <br/> <em><strong>Generation time and maximum rate of increase</strong></em><em></em><br/>The generation time for Sei Whales is estimated to be 23.3 years (Taylor <em>et al</em>. 2007). The three-generation time window for applying the IUCN Red List decline criterion A is 1948–2018.<br/><br/>For assessment purposes, the IWC Scientific Committee has used a natural mortality rate of about 0.06, an age at first reproduction declining with stock depletion from 12-13 years to 10-11 years, and an annual pregnancy rate increasing with stock depletion from 0.27 to 0.37-0.39 (IWC 1977, 1980, Horwood 1980). Assuming a maximum annual pregnancy rate of 0.40, a minimum age of first reproduction of 10 years, and no juvenile mortality, the maximum rate of increase is 2.7% per year. Horwood and Millward (1987) also conclude that the maximum rate of increase for Sei Whale populations is less than 3% per year. Newer data on life history parameters have been collected in the northwestern Pacific during 2004-2015 and are awaiting analysis (IWC 2017).<br/> <br/> <em><strong>Population assessment</strong></em><br/>Because the available published assessments for this species are not up to date, an updated population assessment is conducted here to enable assessment of the population reduction over the period 1948-2018 relative to the Red List A criterion. While the available data do not permit a scientifically rigorous estimation of the extent of population reduction, a conventional population assessment model was used to provide an illustration of the extent of possible reduction relative to the criteria. A conventional deterministic age-structured model with an age at first capture (“recruitment”) and an age at first reproduction, and linear density-dependence was applied to the North Pacific, North Atlantic, and Southern Hemisphere regions separately. Based on the above information, fitted population sizes for the aged 1+ population size were 12,000 in 1989 in the North Atlantic, 35,000 in 2011 in the North Pacific and 10,000 in 1983 in the Southern Hemsiphere.<br/><br/>The results are provided in the Supplementary Materials, which constitute an integral part of this assessment. Results indicate severe depletion from 1948 to a minimum in the 1970s, followed by gradual recovery such that the global population of mature animals in 2018 is predicted to be around 30% of the 1948 level and to be increasing.</p>",Increasing,"<p>The Sei Whale is a cosmopolitan species, with a mainly offshore distribution. The species occurs in the North Atlantic, North Pacific, and Southern Hemisphere, but there are no confirmed records in the northern Indian Ocean (Rice 1998, Afsal <em>et al</em>. 2008, Brownell <em>et al</em>. 2017).<br/> <br/> Sei Whales migrate between tropical and subtropical latitudes in winter and temperate and subpolar latitudes in summer, staying mainly in water temperatures of 8-18°C. Their winter distribution seems to be widely dispersed and is not fully mapped (Horwood 1987, 2017). Sei Whale sightings in the tropics and subtropics can be hard to confirm due to difficulty differentiating them from Bryde’s Whales.<br/> <br/> <em><strong>North Atlantic</strong></em><em></em><br/>In the North Atlantic the summer distribution seems to be quite variable from year to year; however, Sei Whales typically occur north of an arc running from south of Nova Scotia in the west, to the northwestern British Isles and Trondheim (Norway) in the east. They occur as far north as the Davis Strait and the northern end of the Denmark Strait, and to about 70°N in the Norwegian Sea. Occasional incursions into other areas have been noted (e.g., the Gulf of Maine, Schilling <em>et al</em>. 1993). Peaks of catch rates in early and late summer suggested a northward and southward migration through the former Nova Scotia whaling ground (Mitchell 1975). Sei Whales have been scarce in Norwegian and British waters in recent years despite significant catches there in the past. Sei Whales were caught in limited numbers, mainly in late summer, off northwestern Spain (Aguilar and Sanpera 1982). There are very few records from the Mediterranean (Notarbartolo di Sciara and Birkun 2010).<br/><br/>The wintering grounds are poorly known, but some animals occur off the central eastern seaboard of the U.S.A., and they are occasionally seen in winter as far south as the Caribbean Sea and Cap Blanc, Mauritania (Rice 1998, Prieto <em>et al</em>. 2012). Satellite tagging has shown Sei Whale migration from the Azores to the Labrador Sea and to the Canary Islands (Prieto <em>et al</em>. 2014). Winter catches of Sei Whales in an area north of the Cape Verde Islands by the illegal catcher boats Sierra and Tonna in the late 1970s may indicate wintering grounds there (Best 1992).<br/> <br/> <em><strong>North Pacific</strong></em><em></em><br/>In the North Pacific, the Sei Whale summer distribution is mainly north of 40°N, including the offshore North Pacific, the Gulf of Alaska and the Aleutian Islands. They are common only in the southernmost part of the Bering Sea, and have never been recorded in Bering Strait or the Arctic seas. They do not penetrate far into the Okhotsk Sea. Although they are rare in summer south of 40°N in the offshore central and eastern North Pacific (IWC 2018a) the presence of some Sei Whales in Hawaiian waters in both summer and fall has been confirmed (Carretta <em>et al</em>. 2017).<br/><br/>The wintering grounds are poorly known. Surveys in February-March 1993-95 south from Japan to the Philippines, Guam, Northern Mariana Islands, and Ogasawara (Bonin) Islands found no Sei Whales (Miyashita <em>et al</em>. 1996). However, Sei Whales were caught in winter off the Ogasawara Islands during 1923-49. Although Sei and Bryde’s Whales were not routinely distinguished at the time, Omura and Fujino (1954) found that, of a sample of “Sei” Whales examined in detail, those caught during November-April were true Sei Whales whereas those caught in May were Bryde’s Whales. Sei Whales were marked around the Northern Mariana Islands and to the northeast in January-February 1972 and some of them were recaptured in summer in the northeastern and northwestern North Pacific (Masaki 1977). Sei Whales were also sighted on a January-April survey of the waters off Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands in 2007 (Fulling <em>et al</em>. 2011).<br/> <br/> Surveys of the Eastern Tropical Pacific during 1986-2003 showed that Sei Whales were probably rare during the months surveyed (July to November) but there were problems distinguishing them from Brydes Whales (Wade and Gerrodette 1993, Hamilton <em>et al</em>. 2009).<br/> <em><br/> <em><strong>Southern Hemisphere</strong></em></em><em></em><br/>The summer (January–February) distribution in the Southern Hemisphere is mainly in the zone 40–55°S in the South Atlantic and southern Indian oceans, and 45–60°S in the South Pacific (Miyashita <em>et al</em>. 1996), with occasional catches recorded in the high Antarctic (Allison 2017).<br/><br/>Sei and Bryde's Whales were distinguished in Peruvian whaling records from 1973; after that date, Sei Whales were caught or seen on the Peruvian grounds (3°-9°S) mainly, but not exclusively, in the austral winter (Valdivia <em>et al</em>. 1982, 1984).<br/><br/>Sei and Brydes Whales do not seem to have been distinguished in the records of whaling stations in Chile, because only Sei Whales are featured in their catch and sighting records (Maturana 1981, Allison 2017) but Gallardo <em>et al</em>. (1983) found both Sei and Brydes Whales present in summer (February) in most of the range of Chilean whaling operations (32°–38°S). Subsequently, Sei Whales have been observed feeding off Chile (~42°S) during the summer (Galletti <em>et al</em>. 2005). This species is also regularly observed in the Magellan Strait in summer (Acevedo <em>et al</em>. 2017). Sei Whales are also regularly sighted in the Falkland Islands/Islas Malvinas (South Atlantic) with peak occurrence between February and April (Frans and Augé 2016).<br/><br/>Sei Whales were also caught in the austral winter off Costinha, northeastern Brazil (7°S) during 1947-77. Sei and Brydes Whales were distinguished only from 1967; after that date, Sei Whales represented about 90% of the catch of the two species combined (Williamson 1975; da Rocha 1983).<br/><br/>The catches of ""Sei"" Whales recorded off Angola, the Congo, Gabon, and countries in the Gulf of Guinea in the 20th century were probably mainly Bryde's Whales (Weir 2010). Platform-of-opportunity surveys of cetaceans in these waters during 2004-09 resulted in only one Sei Whale sighting out of over 3,000 cetacean sightings, including 88 sightings of Brydes Whales (Weir 2011).

130854611,183848,Atractoscion nobilis,Least Concern,,2020,2019-09-03 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<em>Atractoscion nobilis</em>&#160;is relatively widespread in the Eastern Pacific from Alaska to the Gulf of California. This species has been historically over-fished. The population in the United States is still low relative to historical levels but has increased over the past 30 years due to fishery regulations and a captive breeding program. While management efforts have aided in the recovery of this species, on-going monitoring shows that the species' recovery remains dependent on these conservation efforts. Given the on-going population recovery and its widespread range, this species is listed as Least Concern.&#160;Additional survey work and continued monitoring of this species is required, especially for the disjunct subpopulation in the Gulf of California whose status is unknown, but suspected to be in serious decline from over-fishing.","This demersal fish often occurs in schools over rocky and sandy bottoms, near kelp forests to depths of 120 m and can be found in the surf zone, with young fish found in bays and along sandy beaches (Eschmeyer <em>et al.</em> 1983, Hervas <em>et al.</em>&#160;2010). Adults occur in schools but also as solitary individuals and older juveniles concentrate in shallow areas close to the surf zone (Romo-Curiel <em>et al.</em>&#160;2015). This species feeds on fishes, squids, and crayfish (Hart 1973). Spawning occurs nearshore in spring and summer with a peak in June (Donohoe 1997) and forms spawning aggregations in shallow coastal waters (Aablers and Sepulveda 2012). The maximum recorded length for this species is 160 cm. Males attain sexual maturity at about 42 cm standard length (SL) and females around 54 cm SL (Clark 1930). This species can live to at least 28 years of age (Romo-Curiel <em>et al.</em>&#160;2015). The estimated median mortality rate for wild individuals is 16.5 year<sup>-1</sup>(Lorenzen 2006).","This species has been historically over-fished throughout its distribution. Its population has declined since the early part of this century, corresponding to a decline in landings since the late 1920s. Its range is now probably reduced as few are found regularly north of Point Conception, in northern California. In addition to over-fishing, pollution and habitat destruction have probably contributed to this long-term population decline and range reduction. The subpopulation within the Gulf of California, from approximately Guaymas northward, appears to be completely disjunct and is still heavily fished by gillnet. No population data exists but the species in this region is suspected to be in serious decline.","This species was previously an important fishery species and was moderately exploited in California causing population decline. The population of this species off the coast of California appears to have increased over the past two decades due to improved management efforts (Leung and Allen 2016). Combined commercial and recreational landings increased slightly from 342 t in 2008 to 364 t in 2010 (California Cooperative Fisheries Investigations 1999, 2011). The stock of this species off California is estimated to be at 27% of its unfished level. The Pacific Fishery Management Council policy recommends a biomass target of at least 40% with a minimum threshold of 25%, below which a stock is considered overfished (Valero and Waterhouse 2016). Total recreational and commercial harvest for the 2016-2017 season was about 198 t, equivalent to 33% of the total allowable catch (Department of Fish and Wildlife 2018). Commercial landings for the 2015-2016 and 2016-2017 seasons were 27% and 24% less, respectively than the previous 5-season running averages, meeting the overfished criterion for the commercial fishery. CPUE for juvenile recruit decreased in 2017 by 17% from the previous 5-year average (Department of Fish and Wildlife 2018).&#160;<br/><br/>There is a single breeding population of <em>A. nobilis</em>&#160;that is centred off Baja California, Mexico (Moser <em>et al</em>. 1983, Vojkovich and Reed 1983).&#160;Annual catches of this species in the Gulf of California declined from more than 110 t in 2001 to fewer than 15 t in 2007. Catches subsequently increased to a peak in 2013, dropped dramatically in 2014 and increased to 2013-levels in 2015 with no significant trends observed in CPUE between 2001 and 2015 (Cota-Nieto <em>et al.</em>&#160;2018).",Stable,"This species is endemic to the Eastern Pacific, and is found from Juneau, Alaska south to Magdalena Bay, Baja California, Mexico (Thomas 1968, Hervas <em>et al.</em>&#160;2010). This species occurs from the surf zone to 245 m depth (Donohoe 1997, Romo-Curiel <em>et al.</em>&#160;2015, Aalbers and&#160;Sepulved 2015).","This is an important commercial and recreational species in the United States and Mexico. Fisheries and various regulations (gear restrictions, bag limits, closed seasons, minimum size limits etc) have been in place in the U.S. since the 1930s with the fishery in Mexican waters established since the 1950s (Vojkovich and Reed 1983). Up until 1982, this species comprised as much as 89% of the annual catch landed by the U.S. commercial fleet (CalCOFI 2009). Populations are recovering due to fishery regulations along the coast of California that have placed restrictions on recreational fisheries and banned further commercial catch of this species (gill nets are prohibited). No population information exists for the subpopulation in the Gulf of California, but it is suspected to be in decline due to continued intensive fishing with gill nets.",Marine,"There is a captive breeding program in California for this species, and numerous fishery regulations now in place to help restore this species population, including restrictions on recreational fisheries and further commercial catch of this species (gill nets are prohibited). In March 2004, legislation was enacted to prohibit increased fishing production of the species (Legislation number: NOM-009-PESC-1993).&#160;Research is needed to determine the status of the subpopulation of this species in the Gulf of California. Mexico does not have a specific management strategy for&#160;<em>A. nobilis&#160;</em>but is management by non species-specific regulations (Romo-Curiel <em>et al.</em>&#160;2015). There are currently a number of regulations in place for this species including a minimum landing size of 71 cm TL, bag limits, gear restriction, and closure during the spawning season (mid March to mid June) (Kent <em>et al.</em>&#160;1995, Hervas <em>et al. </em>2010).&#160;<br/><br/>The large numbers of small individuals of this species caught in recent years suggests that the warm water period beginning with the 1982-1983 El Niño event helped to increase young fish survival. Young fish surveys conducted in southern California as part of Ocean Resources Enhancement and Hatchery Program (OREHP), showed a dramatic increase in the number of fish taken in research gillnet sets. During research work in 1997 over 600 juvenile fish were captured, in 1998 approximately 700 individuals were taken, and in 1999 slightly over 1,300 juveniles were captured. from 1986 to 2006, over 1.13 million cultured individuals of <em>A. nobilis</em>&#160;were released on to coastal waters off southern California (Hervas <em>et al.</em>&#160;2010).&#160;Anecdotal evidence from commercial and sport fishers also suggests a dramatic increase in juvenile <em>A. nobilis</em>; however, it is unknown whether this increase in juveniles will subsequently enhance the adult spawning population (Vojkovich and Crooke 2001).","",,false,false,Global

It is common and locally abundant in parts of its range. The species' close association with kelp in addition to its limited dispersal due to viviparity make impacts from kelp loss likely. Declines in kelp biomass have been directly observed in several parts of its range, including declines off Vancouver since about 2009 and severe declines in Northern California since about 2011. The primary driver of this decline is warming waters due to climate change, both natural and anthropogenic-influenced. Overgrazing by abnormally large populations of sea urchin is also a significant stressor. The impact of these declines on the global population of this species is poorly understood due to the lack of direct population studies, but some research is currently underway. At least one localized experimental study observed recruitment and density declines of this species following kelp removal. Due to the documented declines in kelp within this species' range, which has a close association with kelp for habitat and food, but high level of uncertainty regarding the impact of this potential major threat, <em>Brachyistius frenatus</em> is listed as Data Deficient.

It is also often quite abundant among eelgrass and surfgrass, and occasionally over boulders and even sand channels (M. Love pers. comm. 2019). Juveniles tend to aggregate in schools directly below the kelp canopy, while older individuals are less gregarious and more uniformly distributed along the kelp columns to the bottom (Anderson 1994, Hobson and Chess 2001). This species plays an important role in the maintenance of its habitat because it feeds on small, mobile invertebrates on and around kelp (Davenport and Anderson 2007).&#160;</p><p>This species gives birth to live young. During the Fall, between September and December, adults mate and females store the sperm in their ovarian cavity for several months. Fertilization, maturation and hatching takes place in the ovarian cavity, and from June to August, embryos are born as juveniles. Its fecundity is lower than most oviparous teleosts, but relatively large compared to other surfperches, where it produces 2-50 young (Baltz 1984, Wang 1986). It attains sexual maturity within one year of age, longevity is no more than 2 or 3 years (Hubbs and Hubbs 1954, Anderson 1994, Wang 1986) and generation length is approximately one year (Tocts <em>et al.</em> 2016). Its maximum total length is 21 cm (Hobson and Chess 2001).</p>","This species is probably&#160;impacted by declines in kelp,&#160;which is caused primarily by anomalous warm water events influenced by both natural and anthropogenic-driven climate change, including especially a marine heatwave that occurred between 2013-2016 (Catton&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2016,&#160;Bell<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2018, Starko&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2019). A secondary stressor includes overgrazing of the kelp by abnormally large Purple Sea Urchin (<em>Strongylocentrotus purpuratus</em>) populations, which was predicated by the loss of their sea star predator via disease (Catton&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2016,&#160;Starko <em>et al. </em>2019). A harmful algal bloom that occurred off Sonoma in 2011 was an additional stressor leading to declines in Northern California (Catton&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2016).

An experimental removal study of Giant Kelp&#160;(<em>Macrocystis pyrifera</em>) conducted at three sites off&#160;Santa Catalina Island, California recorded a significant decline in both recruitment and density of Kelp Perch (<em>Brachyistius frenatus</em>). In live-bearing species such as this, losses in the adult population reduces its ability to quickly recover even when kelp has recovered (O’Connor and Anderson 2010). Studies are currently underway to elaborate its current population status, including a full-genome analysis of genetic diversity across its range (J. Toy pers. comm. 2019).&#160;<br/><br/>Kelp has declined in a large part of this species' range. Off Vancouver, Canada, kelp cover and diversity has declined over time (as compared to abundance in 1993-1995), with the most significant decline occurring&#160;between 2009 and 2017. Kelp abundance in the Southern California Bight is stable or has slightly increased (Krumhansl&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016), but severe declines have been documented in Northern California in recent years (Catton&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2016). Kelp abundance in California naturally fluctuates on a decadal-scale per the North Pacific Gyre Oscillation as well as periodic El Niño events, but is also probably&#160;impacted by anthropogenic-driven climate change at some level. Giant Kelp canopy biomass from San Francisco to San Diego increased on average over the past 34 years, but recent large-scale warming events such as the 2014 North Pacific warming event and the 2015–2016 El Niño have caused the biomass trends to decline (Bell<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2018).

It is a highly commercial species throughout much of its range and supports some of the largest global fisheries. Data from available assessments  (spawning stock biomass, survey catch rates, landings data, etc.) show some indication of decline over the past 10 years (3 generation lengths); however, this species naturally exhibits large and drastic fluctuations which can be attributed to long-term, regional climatic and environmental conditions and therefore, it is difficult to infer declines based on the available time series. Although this species abundance is currently at historic lows in some regions (e.g., the U.S.; southern Africa; and Japan), it appears to be moderately exploited and is well managed throughout its global range. Therefore, <em>Sardinops sagax</em> is globally assessed as Least Concern. However, overall declines in abundance may be exacerbated by heavy fishing pressure during periods of high abundance, which can result in extended periods of low abundance and subsequent range contractions in areas which generally have viable fisheries. This risk, identified over decades of research and monitoring of the world's major <em>S. sagax</em> fisheries, is now well recognized by regulators and managed accordingly, though localized caution is warranted in areas with consistently high fishing pressure.","<p>This is a marine, pelagic and migratory species forming large shoals that may spread over several kilometres (Whitehead 1985). Observed variations in the geographical distribution of sardine stocks associated with changes in population size show a similar pattern in all subpopulations (Parrish <em>et al</em>. 1989, Alheit <em>et al. </em>2009) and are thought to be closely influenced by prevailing winds, currents and local phytoplankton and zooplankton concentrations (Munroe 2016). For example, spawning grounds have been completely abandoned as subpopulations decrease in size, or colonized as the subpopulation size increases, or both (Parrish <em>et al.</em> 1989). Similarly, the diets of all five subpopulations show some variation but are generally similar throughout; this species primarily feeds on zooplankton, mostly small crustaceans (i.e., copepods, ostracods, euphausiids and mysids), but also feeds on mollusc larvae and phytoplankton (i.e., diatoms: Whitehead 1985). Individuals reach maturity between 1 – 2 years of age; it is thought that a majority spawn at age 2 (Whitehead 1985). Spawning changes geographically within and between regions but is generally in the winter and spring months of the geographic region with the period extending into summer months in some regions (e.g., off Australia and New Zealand: Whitehead 1985). </p>  <p>Geographic variations in some biological characteristics have also been observed within and between subpopulations, such as maximum size, longevity and depth, as well as preferred spawning habitat. In general, this species is known to a maximum of 36 cm standard length, but is more commonly found to be about 18 - 25 cm; subpopulations in the eastern Pacific are typically larger than the others (Whitehead 1985). Funamoto (2018) reports the subpopulation in the northwestern Pacific (sometimes referred to as <em>S. melanostictus </em>or <em>S. sagax melanostictus</em>) has a maximum longevity of 7 years; Whitehead (1985) reported the northeastern Pacific subpopulation (sometimes referred to as <em>S. caeruleus </em>or <em>S. sagax caeruleus</em>) has a maximum longevity of about 25 years. This species is known from depths up to 40 – 200 m (Whitehead 1985, Munroe 2016). Available information related to spawning habitat from each geographically separated subpopulation is variable, but suggests that this species uses either inshore (bays and coastal waters) and/or offshore (~ 80 km offshore with depths up to 5,000 m) areas to spawn (Whitehead 1985, Oozeki <em>et al.</em> 2007). </p>    <p><strong><u>Subpopulation-specific information</u></strong></p>  <p>The northeastern Pacific subpopulation (sometimes referred to as <em>S. caeruleus </em>or <em>S. sagax caeruleus</em>) has the longest estimated maximum longevity (20 – 25 years) and the largest measured maximum standard length (36 cm), but is usually found to 20 cm SL (Whitehead 1985). This subpopulation mainly matures within 1 - 2 years and breeds in late winter to early summer months (January – June) with peak spawning in April – May (Whitehead 1985). This subpopulation migrates northward during summer months between California and British Columbian waters, and returns southward in autumn and winter months to spawn off the southern California coast (~ 80 km offshore), between the Point of Conception and San Diego (Whitehead 1985), possibly extending to southern Baja, California (Kramer 1970, Parrish <em>et al. </em>1989). Spawning takes place during the night and individuals produce pelagic eggs (Whitehead 1985). </p>    <p>The southeastern Pacific subpopulation (sometimes referred to as <em>S. sagax sensu stricu </em>or <em>S. sagax sagax</em>) is known to a maximum standard length of 30 cm, but is more commonly found to 20 cm SL (Whitehead 1985). This species can be found down to depths of at least 40 m (Whitehead 1985). It is known to breed twice in one season (at least off Chile), mostly between July – September (Whitehead 1985). The spawning period can extend between February – March, though this is less common (Whitehead 1985). This species forms large schools in the Peru Current (Whitehead 1985). Large southward geographical range shifts of this subpopulation have been observed in association with El Niño event (Parrish <em>et al. </em>1989). Evidence available from years not affected by El Niño events suggest an abundance of sardines in northern Chile have a seasonal pattern, with peak abundances occurring during the winter spawning season and much lower abundances during summer and fall (Serra and Tsukayama 1988, Parrish <em>et al. </em>1989). </p>    <p>The northwestern Pacific subpopulation (sometimes referred to as <em>S. melanostictus </em>or <em>S. sagax melanostictus</em>) has a maximum known standard length of 32 cm based on an individual collected from the Shimane Prefecture, Japan (H. Hata <em>pers. comm. </em>2018), but is more commonly found to 15 – 20 cm SL (Whitehead 1985). Individuals in this region reach maturity at age 2 and breed in winter and spring months from about November to the beginning of May; in the southern portion of the northwestern Pacific range, this species spawns in the earlier months of the spawning period (Whitehead 1985). Peak spawning is thought to take place in February (Oozeki <em>et al. </em>2007); eggs are most abundant between February and March (Oozeki <em>et al. </em>2007). Spawning mainly takes place along the Pacific coast of Japan and has been observed inshore in protected bays, in the surface waters of open seas and in offshore waters over bottom depth of up to 5,000 m (Whitehead 1985, Oozeki <em>et al. </em>2007). This migratory species tends to move northward and inshore in the summer months, returning southward and more offshore in the winter months (Whitehead 1985). </p>    <p>The southeastern Indian and southwestern Pacific subpopulation (sometimes referred to as <em>S. neopilchardus </em>or <em>S. sagax neopilchardus</em>) has a maximum known standard length of 21.3 cm, but is more commonly found to 18 cm SL (Whitehead 1985). This subpopulation reaches maturity between 8 – 13 cm standard length throughout most of its range; individuals off New Zealand are reported to reach maturity at 12 cm SL or above (Whitehead 1985). It is thought that the subpopulation off Australia breeds throughout its entire geographical range, but at different times (Parrish <em>et al. </em>1989); in the southern parts of its range, spawning takes place in the spring and summer months (September – February), whereas in the northern parts of its range, spawning takes place in the winter months (June – August: Whitehead 1985). In contrast, off New Zealand spawning is concentrated in the area between the North and South Islands (Parrish <em>et al. </em>1989). This species forms large school at the surface during the spawning periods and when juveniles leave sheltered bays to join adult schools (i.e., southern New South Wales: Whitehead 1985). </p>    The southeastern Atlantic and southwestern Indian subpopulation (sometimes referred to as <em>S. ocellatus </em>or <em>S. sagax ocellatus</em>) is known to maximum standard length of 28 cm, but is more commonly found to 25 cm (Whitehead 1985). This is a highly migratory species (though the northern stock perhaps rarely moves south of the Orange River) that prefers the cooler, coastal waters of the southwestern African shelf (Whitehead 1985). This subpopulation primarily spawns between September – April and is known to breed either offshore (January – March) or inshore (September – December: Munroe 2016).","The larger subpopulations of this species seem to naturally undergo drastic population fluctuations due to inter-annual, annual and long-term climactic changes resulting in large range contractions and expansions over time (Whitehead 1985, Parrish <em>et al. </em>1989, Alheit <em>et al. </em>2009). Observed variations in the geographical distribution of subpopulations show a similar pattern in each isolated region where this species has been heavily exploited (Parrish <em>et al. </em>1989, Barange <em>et al. </em>2009); overall declines in abundance may be exacerbated by heavy fishing pressure during times of high abundance. Periods of low abundance and subsequent range contractions result in fishery collapse in areas which generally have viable fisheries (Parrish <em>et al</em>. 1989). Given this species has an anti-tropical geographical distribution and prefers cooler waters, a global increase in average sea surface temperature (SST) may result in prolonged or permanent range contractions in all isolated regions, though more research is needed to determine the extent this may affect this species.","Landings of <em>Sardinops sagax</em> are reported to the FAO as three nominal species: <em>S. sagax</em>, which represents subpopulations off Australia, and in the eastern Pacific off the western coasts of North and South America; <em>S. ocellatus</em>, which represents the subpopulation off South Africa; and <em>S. melanostictus</em>, which represents the subpopulation off Japan. Globally, combined landings of the three nominal species average just over 6.5 million tonnes annually between 1950 and 2014 with a peak of 25 million tonnes in 1985 (FAO 2016). Catch reconstructions are available for <em>Sardinops sagax</em> (1950 - 2010) which appear to encompass global catches and report lower annual catches, averaging just over 3.7 million tonnes annually, but otherwise track very closely with landings reported to the FAO (Pauly and Zeller 2015).<br/><br/>Landings reported to the FAO and reconstructed catches show a sharp increasing trend between 1970 and the mid-1980s followed by peak landings between about 1984 - 1988; a maximum of about 25 million tonnes was reported to the FAO in 1985 (FAO 2016). Following 1988, landings and reconstructed catches declined to quantities similar to historical values (&lt; 5 million tonnes) by the late 1990s, and continued to decline below historical catches until the end of the available time series (2010 for reconstructed catches and 2014 for reported landings: FAO 2016, Pauly and Zeller 2015).<br/><br/>According to Parrish <em>et al.</em> (1989), previous theoretical considerations and attempts to find discrete genetic stocks suggest it is unlikely that this species can be subdivided into genetically definable stocks within the individual current systems. However, more recent work has been completed (e.g., Schwartzlose <em>et al.</em> 1999, Miller 2006, Ohshimo <em>et al.</em> 2009, Baldwin <em>et al.</em> 2012, Roux <em>et al.</em> 2013,&#160; Demer and Zwolinski 2014, van der Lingen <em>et al. </em>2015, Izzo <em>et al.</em> 2017) to suggest otherwise; at least two or three stocks are recognized in each current system where this species occurs (Izzo <em>et al.</em> 2017).<br/><br/><strong>Subpopulation-specific information</strong><br/><em><br/>Northeast Pacific</em> - This subpopulation (sometimes referred to as <em>S. caeruleus</em> or <em>S. sagax caeruleus</em>) is further subdivided into three units: northern (northern Mexico to southern Alaska), southern (Baja Peninsula  to southern California) and Gulf of California (Baldwin <em>et al. </em>2012,  Demer and Zwolinski 2014, Izzo<em> et al.</em> 2017). The northern and southern units appear to move north and south along the coast in  synchrony, but spawn in separate localities and seasons (Garcia-marales  <em>et al.</em> 2012, Izzo <em>et al.</em> 2017). It is an important commercial fishery for Canada, the U.S. and Mexico (Demer and Zwolinski 2017). Current subpopulation information is limited. Previously, the subpopulation collapsed in the 1950s and early 1960s resulting in a large contraction of its geographical range; it was virtually absent from waters north of Point Conception (34°N) until the 1980s. A minor recovery of the subpopulation increased its range as far north as San Francisco (Parrish <em>et al. </em>1989). A recent trawl survey (2001) indicated that this species was largely concentrated offshore between San Francisco and the Point of Conception (33 and 38°N: Demer <em>et al.</em> 2013). In April of 2011, total biomass of the subpopulation was estimated to be ~ 0.494 million metric tonnes (Demer <em>et al.</em> 2013). Independent surveys conducted by the U.S. and British Columbia have reported a significant decrease in sardine biomass (DFO 2011) and spawning stock biomass since 2006 (Hill <em>et al.</em> 2017). Spawning stock biomass has reached historically low levels in recent years (2014 - 2017: Hill <em>et al.</em> 2017). Total coast wide biomass in has declined by ~57% and ~ 79% between 2006 and 2010 in U.S. and Canadian waters, respectively (DFO 2011). The observed decrease in biomass coincided with unusual ocean conditions which may have affected overall abundance and distribution (DFO 2011), similar to other global subpopulations of this species. Recruitment in U.S. waters has also declined since 2005 - 2006 with the exception of a brief period of modest recruitment in 2009 - 2010; a small increase in recruitment was observed in 2016 but the estimate is highly variable and based off limited data (Hill <em>et al.</em> 2017). The 2001 - 2015 year classes have been among the weakest observed in recent history (Hill <em>et al</em>. 2017). Exploitation rates of this species in U.S. waters have averaged about 11 % since 2005 with peak of 13% in 2013; both the U.S. and total exploitation rates of this species in northern U.S. were less than 1%&#160; in 2016 (Hill <em>et al.</em> 2017).<br/><br/><em>Southeast Pacific</em> - This subpopulation (sometimes referred to as<em> S. sagax sensu stricu</em> or <em>S. sagax sagax</em>) is further subdivided into three units: northern (southern Ecuador to central Peru), central (southern Peru to northern Chile), and southern (off Chile: Schartzlose <em>et al.</em> 1999). In this region, this species is a dominant small pelagic resource along with the engraulid, <em>Engraulis ringens </em>(Passuni <em>et al. </em>2018) where it is known to undergo periods of high and low abundance, similar to other global subpopulations. Landings reported to the FAO (1950 - 2014) from the southeast Pacific are presumably referring to this subpopulation and are driven by landings from Peru and Chile with an average of 1.1 million tonnes (FAO 2016). The trend in reported landings tracks very closely with the global trends in landings of this species and is represented by a sharp increase between 1970 and the early 1980s followed by a peak in 1985 (~6.5 million tonnes) and a sharp decline until 2014, the most recent year available in the time series (936 tonnes: FAO 2016).<br/><br/><em>Northwestern Pacific </em>- This subpopulation (sometimes referred to as <em>S. melanostictus </em>or <em>S. sagax melanostictus</em>) is further subdivided into two units: one which occupies the Sea of Japan and East China Sea, and another which occurs along the Pacific coast (Ohshimo <em>et al</em>. 2009, Izzo <em>et al.</em> 2017). In this region, this species is important to fisheries and has experienced wide fluctuations similar to other global subpopulations (Parrish <em>et al</em>. 1989). Declines in landings were reported in the 1940s and the fishery was greatly reduced in the northern portion of its range (e.g., Honshu and Hokkaido) and was primarily restricted to the western Sea of Japan and East China Sea (Parrish <em>et al.</em> 1989). The contraction of spawning grounds was also observed during this time (Parrish <em>et al.</em> 1989). The subpopulation reportedly recovered in the 1970's and expanded its spawning habitat to encompass grounds around southern Kyushu (Parrish <em>et al. </em>1989), specifically including Tanegashima Island, Osumi Islands (H. Hata <em>pers. comm. </em>2018). The population in the NW Pacific has shown a continuous decline from about 1987 - 2003 (Nishida <em>et al.</em> 2005, Nishida <em>et al.</em> 2007). Biomass decreased from ~14 - 19 million tons in the 1980s to less than 1 million tons in the late 1990s; biomass remains at very low levels in the most recent years available (2005: Nishida <em>et al.</em> 2007). Additionally, egg abundance has declined by at least an order of magnitude from the 1980s to the early 2000s; juvenile abundance has also declined since the mid-1990s (Nishida <em>et al.</em> 2005, Nishida<em> et al.</em> 2007).<br/><br/><em>Southeastern Indian and southwestern Pacific</em> - This subpopulation (sometimes referred to as <em>S. neopilchardus</em> or <em>S. sagax neopilchardus</em>) is further subdivided into at least four units with some degree of overlap: southwestern coast (off Western Australia), Great Australian Bight and Spencer Gulf, Bass Strait and Port Phillip Bay (off Victoria and Tasmania), and eastern Australia; additional evidence exists for the subdivision of units off Western Australia and the east coast (Izzo <em>et al.</em> 2017). This species is important to fisheries off Australian and New Zealand waters. Catches have increased since the beginning of the available time series (1975) with some fluctuation (Ward <em>et al. </em>2014a, Izzo <em>et al.</em> 2017). Catches peaked off Western Australia in the 1990s (Izzo <em>et al.</em> 2017) but have remained at low levels over the last two decades following two mass mortality events which impacted the entire population in the mid - late 1990's (Ward <em>et al.</em> 2001, Whittington <em>et al.</em> 2008). A recent stock assessment off South Australia was conducted and indicated that catch and effort has increased between the years 1990 – 2016 after the establishment of a large fishery in 1991 (Ward <em>et al.</em> 2017); it is possible that the increase in catch is also associated with high abundance years in this region. For example, the Total Allowable Commercial Catch (TACC) has increased over the last decade from 30,000 t in 2007 - 2009, to 42,750 t in 2017; total annual catches in South Australian waters have also increased (~30,000 t in 2007 to ~38,000 t in 2016: Ward <em>et al.</em> 2017). Significant catches in Australia have been taken from New South Wales, Victoria and in Commonwealth waters (Ward&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014b), though a large majority of catch in this region is taken from South Australia (specifically Spencer Gulf), which represents only a small portion of this species total range (Izzo <em>et al.</em> 2017); there is concern regarding the potential local depletion in the Spencer Gulf (Izzo <em>et al. </em>2017).&#160;The fishery in South Australia (Spencer Gulf) was established in 1991 and is currently the largest fishery by volume in the country (Total Allowable Catch in 2016 was 38,000 t: Izzo <em>et al</em>. 2017). Effort has been relatively stable since 2007, ranging from ~760 to 1100 net-sets per year (Ward <em>et al.</em> 2017). Mean annual CPUE have risen from ~30 t/set-net in 2007 to over 40 t/set-net in 2015 and 2016 (Ward<em> et al.</em> 2017). The estimated spawning stock biomass for 2017 was estimated to be between 236,00 t - 305,000 t and is the largest obtained for the southern stock of sardine in Australian waters; the southern stock is classified as sustainable as the spawning biomass for 2017 exceeds the target reference point of 150,000 t in the harvest strategy for the South Australian Sardine Fishery (SASF: Ward <em>et al. </em>2017). <br/><br/><em>Southeastern Atlantic and southwestern Indian</em> - This subpopulation (sometimes referred to as <em>S. ocellatus</em> or <em>S. sagax ocellatus</em>) is further subdivided into at least two units: northern (Namibia) and southern (South Africa); additionally, the southern unit is broken down further into three subunits: east of Agulhas Bank, west of Agulhas Bank, and off KwaZulu-Natal (Miller <em>et al.</em> 2006, Izzo <em>et al</em>. 2017, Okomadu 2017). Limited information is available related to this subpopulation, though it is commercially important and reported to follow similar boom-bust patterns of the other four global subpopulations. This species supports a major fishery in African waters and has largely experienced major fluctuations in catches (Okumadu 2017). Off Namibia, the biomass of this unit crashed in the late 1960's; a slight recovery was observed in the 1990's but various stresses (e.g., heavy fishing pressure and abnormal environmental conditions such as hypoxia and the Benguela El Niño) caused a further decline in biomass and catches (Okumadu 2017). Presently, low sardine biomass can only allow limited fishing activity (Okumadu 2017). Within South Africa, the small pelagic fishery which targets this unit is the largest commercial fishery by volume and the second largest in net value (Okumadu 2017). The South African Sardine purse seine fishery has been concentrated along the western coast since the 1940's (Okumadu 2017). This species has undergone wide fluctuations in abundance since the beginning of industrial-scale fishing (Okumadu 2017). Similar to Namibia, high sardine catches taken in South Africa in the early 1960s were followed by drastic declines (Okumadu 2017); a slow recovery followed after management measures were put in place in the mid - 1980s (Okumadu 2017). A slight increase in biomass and catches between 2001 and 2005 (~ 4 million tonnes) resulted from good recruitment; however poor recruitment in 2004 has led to another substantial decrease in biomass in recent years (~ 250,000 tonnes in 2007 - 2008: Okumadu 2017) and has remained at a low biomass since about 2006 (DAFF 2016). In 2015, the Total Allowable Catch for this species was set below 90,000 t for the first time since 1997 which represents its depleted state in South African waters (DAFF 2016). <br/><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span style=""""><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>",Unknown,"<em>Sardinops sagax </em>exhibits an antitropical distribution with five geographically isolated subpopulations that were given taxonomic names at some time in their history. Based on Whitehead (1985) and Parrish <em>et al.</em> (1989), the distributions of these five subpopulations are as follows. In the eastern Pacific, this species occurs from southeastern Alaska, south to Baja California, including the Gulf of California (sometimes referred to as <em>S. caeruleus</em> or <em>S. sagax caeruleus</em>), and from Peru to Chile including the Galapagos Islands (referred to as&#160;<em>S. sagax sensu strictu</em> or <em>S. sagax sagax</em>). In the northwestern Pacific, it occurs from Peter the Great Bay, Russia, south to at least Taiwan; H. Hata (<em>pers. comm.</em> 2018) reports it to be widely distributed throughout Japan from Hokkaido to Kyushu, but does not occur off the Ryukyu Islands (sometimes referred to as <em>S. melanostictus </em>or <em>S. sagax melanostictus</em>). In the southeastern Indian and southwestern Pacific, this species occurs from Shark Bay, Western Australia to the Great Barrier Reef, Queensland and New Zealand (referred to as <em>S. neopilchardus</em> or <em>S. sagax neopilchardus</em>). In the southeastern Atlantic and southwestern Indian, this species occurs from Baia dos Tigres, Angola to Durban, South Africa&#160; (referred to as&#160;<em>S. ocellatus</em>&#160;or&#160;<em>S. sagax ocellatus</em>); more recent records report this species from Madagascar (Fricke <em>et al.</em> 2018) and the Macarenes (Fricke 1999).&#160;This species occurs in coastal waters to a depth of about 200 m<span style=""""> (Munroe 2016)<span style=""font-style: italic;"">.&#160;</span>","<p>In general, this species is one of the most important commercial fishes throughout a large portion of its range. It is caught with purse seine, trawls, gill nets and beach seines. Pilchards are marketed fresh, frozen or canned and used for fish meal and fish oil (Munroe 2016). Historically, the five subpopulations contributed about one-quarter of all clupeoid fishes caught making this the most productive out of all clupeoid genera (more than 8 million tonnes in 1983: Whitehead 1985). </p>  <p><strong><u>Subpopulation-specific information</u></strong></p>    <p>The northeastern Pacific subpopulation (sometimes referred to as <em>S. caeruleus </em>or <em>S. sagax caeruleus</em>) is fished by Canada, the United States and Mexic<span style="""">o (Demer and Zwolinski 2017). Landings declined and a fishing moratorium was put in place in the late 1960s (Whitehead 1985) which was reopened in the 1980s. More recently, catches decreased by approximately 95% (1.8 million mt – 86,000 mt) off the U.S. coast between the years 2006 – 2017 warranting current fishery closures in this region (Hill <em>et al.</em> 2017).</span> </p>  <p>The southeastern Pacific subpopulation (sometimes referred to as <em>S. sagax sensu stricu </em>or <em>S. sagax sagax</em>) undergoes large southward geographical range shifts during El Niño years; Ecuadorian and Peruvian fisheries can experience drastic declines as this species migrates out of available fishing zones (Parrish <em>et al. </em>1989). It is not uncommon for total catch to exceed 1 – 2 million tons annually (Whitehead 1985). A majority of catch (~90%) is utilized for fishmeal for fish oil, ~ 4% is canned and the remaining quantity is marketed fresh or frozen (Whitehead 1985). </p>  <p>The northwestern Pacific subpopulation (sometimes referred to as <em>S. melanostictus </em>or <em>S. sagax melanostictus</em>) is one of the most commercially important fishes in Japan with record catches exceeding 4 million tons (Whitehead 1985). Observed catches declined sharply in the 1940s; however catches in this geographical region, as in others, generally show notable fluctuations (Whitehead 1985, Parrish <em>et al. </em>1989). </p>  <p>Compared to other subpopulations, no globally significant fishery has existed for the southeastern Indian and southwestern Pacific subpopulation (sometimes referred to as <em>S. neopilchardus </em>or <em>S. sagax neopilchardus</em>) off Australia and New Zealand (Whitehead 1985, Parrish <em>et al. </em>1989). However, based on a recent stock assessment off southern Australia, catch and effort for this species has increased between the years 1990 – 2016 (Ward <em>et al. </em>2017) to be regionally important. It is commonly used as fishing bait and fodder for aquaculture, and is taken with purse seine nets (Whitehead 1985, D.

Gaughan <em>pers. obs. </em>2001).</p>",Marine,"No known species-specific conservation measures are currently in place globally, though its total distribution overlaps with existing marine protected areas (IUCN and UNEP-WCMC 2018). Regional fishery management initiatives (i.e., yearly monitoring, stock assessments, quotas, limited entry fisheries and seasonal closures) are in place and implemented to a varying degree (Barange <em>et al. </em>2009) throughout most of it range, especially in Australia (Ward <em>et al.</em> 2017) and the United States (Hill <em>et al.</em> 2017, Pacific Fishery Management Council 2018). Off California, fishing moratoriums have been put in place for this species during the 1960s - 1980s (Whitehead 1985), and more recently in 2015 - 2017 (Hill <em>et al.</em> 2017, Pacific Fishery Management Council 2018).","",,false,false,Global
145357488,18596,Pseudorca crassidens,Near Threatened,A2d,2018,2018-07-23 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<p>False Killer Whales are widely distributed in tropical, subtropical, and warm temperate waters of the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans, but they are not common anywhere. They occur at highest densities in tropical areas, but even there are generally among the less common delphinids. The sum of existing abundance estimates is 59,157 animals, although the two largest estimates (accounting for approximately 94% of the total number) are more than 25 years old. No abundance estimates are available for a substantial part of the range of the species, and therefore total abundance is likely much higher than 60,000. Because of these whales’ low density, abundance estimates are imprecise, and thus there is no ability to assess trends in most areas.<br/><br/>False Killer Whales feed on fish species that are targeted by major high-value fisheries, including tunas and billfishes, and they regularly engage in depredation on both catch and bait in hook-and-line fisheries. This makes them both more vulnerable to bycatch in hook-and-line fisheries and to reductions in available prey than most species of cetaceans with similar distributions, as these other species tend to feed on small mesopelagic fish and squid or on deep-water prey such as squid.<br/><br/>The primary threats to False Killer Whales are incidental mortality (“bycatch”) in fisheries and, in some areas, directed hunting or culling. Generation length has been estimated at 25 years. Because of their life history, even low levels of bycatch or directed takes could result in population declines. Numbers taken in directed hunts in Japan have likely been great enough to reduce nearshore populations, and False Killer Whales are at least occasionally targeted in direct hunts in a few other parts of their range (Indonesia and West Indies). Bycatch is greatest in longline and other hook-and-line fisheries, but some mortality also occurs in gillnet and seine fisheries. In Hawaii, one area where they have been studied extensively, there is strong evidence of multiple subpopulations, and these have been recognized under U.S. law as separate stocks. Bycatch of the Hawaii pelagic stock in the U.S. longline fishery has been at a level thought to be high enough to limit population growth for most years since bycatch rates and abundance estimates have been available. This is a transboundary stock and foreign fleets account for the majority of longline effort in surrounding international waters, thus total bycatch levels are likely much higher than indicated by the U.S. observer program. Bycatch is known to occur in other areas but limited or no observer coverage in most fisheries and lack of abundance estimates precludes quantitative assessment of bycatch levels in relation to abundance. The only stock that has been quantitatively assessed (the main Hawaiian Islands insular stock) was estimated to have had a &gt;50% decline in abundance in less than two generations (Oleson <em>et al</em>. 2010), with fishery interactions (primarily hooking and entanglement) thought to be the most important threat.<br/><br/>False Killer Whales were listed as Data Deficient on the IUCN Red List in 2008, and the species remains data-poor for most of its range. The Red List Guidelines (Version 13, 2017) note that a taxon that comes close to qualifying for the Vulnerable (VU) category based on the Vulnerable thresholds qualifies for the Near Threatened (NT) category. This consideration combined with biological susceptibility and threat strengthens the case for a NT listing. A 30% or greater decline in three generations based on category A2(d) – a population reduction observed, estimated, inferred, or suspected, based on actual or potential levels of exploitation – qualifies a taxon for the Vulnerable category. The False Killer Whale comes close to meeting the criteria for VU for the following reasons: 1) there has been an estimated population decline of &gt;50% in two generations in the one population that has been quantitatively assessed, with the primary cause thought to be fishery interactions; 2) bycatch is a widespread threat at levels suspected to be large enough to result in population reduction throughout much of the taxon’s range, and levels of fishing effort are unlikely to decline substantially in the near future; 3) levels of directed take in some areas are likely high enough to have reduced local populations; and 4) biological susceptibility to population-level effects of bycatch exists given the life history of these whales, the overlap of their diet with the target species of high-value commercial fisheries, and their tendency to engage in depredation on catch and bait in hook-and-line fisheries. Given the above, False Killer Whales are therefore assessed as NT. Although the rangewide decline could be large enough for the species to qualify for VU, collecting the data necessary to quantify the extent of decline for a globally distributed, pelagic species is very difficult. Risk levels could be better assessed at the subpopulation level and efforts should be made toward that end.</p>","<p>While False Killer Whales occur in tropical, sub-tropical, and at least occasionally in warm temperate waters worldwide (Stacey <em>et al</em>. 1994, Odell and McClune 1999), their density is highest in the tropics (Ferguson and Barlow 2003). They are generally found in relatively deep, offshore waters, but individuals do approach close to shore around oceanic islands (e.g., Hawaii). Individuals from the main Hawaiian Islands resident subpopulation use both shallow (&lt;100 m) and deep (to 4,700 m) waters around the Hawaiian archipelago (Baird 2016). Some animals may move into shallow and higher latitude waters seasonally (e.g., off New Zealand; Zaeschmar 2014) or periodically (including some semi-enclosed seas such as the Red Sea and the Mediterranean). Individuals have been documented spending extended periods of time (two to three months) in shallow water areas of the Timor and Arafura seas (Palmer <em>et al</em>. 2009, 2017). Individuals and groups have been reported to enter rivers on the Chinese mainland (Zhou <em>et al</em>. 1995), but it was not clear whether these occurrences might have represented pre-stranding behaviour.<br/><br/>False Killer Whales eat primarily relatively large fish and cephalopods (Alonso <em>et al</em>. 1999). They have been known to attack and consume small dolphins that have been injured or disoriented when released from tuna purse seine nets, but this behavior may be more akin to learning to take advantage of opportunistic food sources than to a predilection to feed on other species of marine mammals (Baird 2018). They eat some large species of fish, such as Mahimahi (also called Dorado or Dolphinfish), Yellowfin Tuna, Skipjack Tuna, Albacore Tuna, Opah, Wahoo, pomphrets, Broadbill Swordfish and Sailfish (Oleson <em>et al.</em> 2010). In Hawaiian waters observational studies suggest that large pelagic game fish (Mahimahi, tunas, billfishes) form the majority of their diet (Baird <em>et al</em>. 2008, Baird 2016). Depredation data on longline-caught fish suggest a preference for billfishes, Wahoo and tunas over Mahimahi, pomfrets, Walu, sharks or lancetfishes (Oleson <em>et al.</em> 2010).</p><p></p>","<p>False Killer Whales are long-lived, slow to reproduce, upper-trophic level predators, and as such are subject to effects of a number of different anthropogenic stressors. The overlap of their diet with species targeted by fisheries, in particular high-value species such as tunas and billfishes, results in a number of types of interactions that can reduce local populations, although the sparseness of observer coverage in most hook-and-line and other fisheries within the range of False Killer Whales limits the information available. In addition, the False Killer Whale is one of several species known to mass strand (Caldwell <em>et al. </em>1970, Alonso <em>et al.</em> 1999, Liebig <em>et al.</em> 2007), with the largest known mass stranding of 835 individuals in Argentina in 1946 (Caillet-Bois 1948). Such mass strandings have the potential to affect local populations.<br/><br/>False Killer Whales are hooked in longline fisheries as they engage in depredation on both the catch and bait (Hernandez-Milian <em>et al</em>. 2008, Thode <em>et al</em>. 2016). The U.S. Hawaii-based deep-set longline fishery has had approximately 20% observer coverage since 2001, and has provided detailed information on bycatch rates. In this fishery, False Killer Whales are the most frequently recorded species of cetacean hooked as bycatch (Forney and Kobayashi 2005, Bradford and Forney 2014). The first abundance estimates became available for the Hawaii pelagic stock in 2003 (Barlow 2006, Bradford <em>et al</em>. 2014b), and documented mortality and serious injury inside the U.S. EEZ surrounding the Hawaiian Archipelago exceeded the potential biological removal (PBR) level for 10 of the 12 years from 2003-2015 (Carretta <em>et al</em>.&#160;2013,&#160;2017). Rates of hooking or entanglement are approximately 1.5 individuals for every 1 million hooks set. This is a transboundary population and non-U.S. fisheries outside the U.S. EEZ surrounding the Hawaiian Archipelago represent the majority of longline effort, thus bycatch rates for the entire Hawaii pelagic stock are likely much higher than estimated. Non-lethal but potentially significant injuries (such as those that compromise health and ability to reproduce) may also occur if animals are hooked (Baird and Gorgone 2005, Baird <em>et al</em>. 2014, Alves <em>et al</em>. 2018). The rate of non-lethal line-related injuries is significantly higher in the main Hawaiian Islands insular stock than in the Hawaii pelagic stock (Baird <em>et al</em>. 2014). The main Hawaiian Islands insular stock has only limited overlap with the longline fishery, but there are no observers in the nearshore fisheries, and thus no bycatch estimates are available. Longline fisheries occur throughout the central and western tropical Pacific, and similar interactions with False Killer Whales occur in other regions (e.g., Indian Ocean, Kiszka <em>et al</em>. 2010, Anderson 2014; American Samoa, Bradford and Forney 2014; Mediterranean, Bearzi 2002; western North Atlantic, Waring <em>et al</em>. 2015). Observers on Spanish longline vessels documented two bycaught False Killer Whales off the Azores in 2006 in approximately 810,000 observed hooks (Hernandez-Milian <em>et al</em>. 2008), a rate similar to the Hawaii-based longline fishery. The incidental catch rate (including animals hooked but released alive) was estimated from 1992-2005 from observers in the Spanish longline fleet at 1.464, 1.685, and 0.797 individuals per million hooks for the Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific Oceans, respectively (Ramos-Cartelle and Mejuto 2008.) Observer programs to monitor bycatch in fisheries in most parts of the world are limited (if they exist at all), but given what is known regarding both the abundance of False Killer Whales and their predilection to take fish off lines, there is certainly potential for bycatch to result in population declines.</p>  <p>Based on observer reports, False Killer Whales were the most frequently reported species of cetacean killed in the tropical western and central Pacific purse seine fishery in 2009, with an estimated mortality of 281 (SPC-OFP 2010). Interactions with this fishery were observed within the EEZs of Papua New Guinea, Kiribati, the Federated States of Micronesia, and Nauru, and in international waters. Mortality of False Killer Whales has been documented in Chinese purse seine fisheries in the western Pacific (Dai <em>et al</em>. 2017). By contrast, the only mortality documented in the eastern tropical Pacific purse seine fishery since 2001 was in 2010 (IATTC 2011).<br/><br/>Incidental takes of small numbers of False Killer Whales in gill nets have been documented off northern Australia, Sri Lanka, India, Ghana, Brazil, Venezuela, Peru, Japan, Republic of Korea, and China (Perrin <em>et al</em>. 2005, Reeves <em>et al.</em> 2014, Song 2018). Wang <em>et al</em>. (2013) noted that entanglement in large-mesh drift gillnets is likely responsible for most False Killer Whale fishery-related mortality off eastern Taiwan. Yang <em>et al</em>. (1999) reported on cetacean bycatch rates in Chinese coastal fisheries (trawl, gill, and stow nets), which may number in the hundreds per year for False Killer Whales alone.<br/><br/>False Killer Whales have been taken in drive and harpoon fisheries in a number of areas, either for meat or oil, or to reduce populations due to real or perceived fishery conflicts. At least in some areas, the numbers taken have likely reduced local populations. False Killer Whales are occasionally taken at Saint Vincent in the Caribbean for meat and cooking oil (Caldwell and Caldwell 1975). Considerable numbers of False Killer Whales have also been killed in a past drive fishery in the Penghu Islands of Taiwan (Zhou <em>et al</em>. 1995). Official catch records were not recorded until 1972, but from 1958 to 1960, 900 individuals were killed in drive fisheries off northern Kyushu (Kasuya 2017). From 1972 to 2008, 2,643 were reported killed in all fishery types (including bycatch) in Japan, with the highest number in one year of 637 in 1978 (Kasuya 2017). Abundance for coastal Japan was estimated at 2,029 (Kasuya 2017), so this one-year take would have represented approximately 31% of the coastal population as estimated from 1983 to 1991. Over 1,500 were killed in drive fisheries off northern Kyushu between 1972 and 1993, with peak mortality occurring from 1978 to 1983 when 1,358 were reportedly taken (Kasuya 2017). Smaller numbers (171) were killed in a drive fishery at Izu on the east coast of Honshu from 1978 to 1996 with 123 taken in 1978 (Kasuya 2017), and 79 were killed in a crossbow fishery in Okinawa between 1993 and 2011 (Kasuya 2017). False Killer Whales have also been killed in the drive fishery at Taiji on the west coast of Honshu, with 586 killed between 1982 and 2011 and up to 91 killed in a single year (Kasuya 2017). Quotas are in place in Japan for drive and crossbow fisheries although those quotas have only rarely been reached in recent years (Kasuya 2017). Some of the animals caught in the Japanese and Taiwanese drive fisheries have been kept alive and sold to oceanaria (Reeves <em>et al</em>. 2003). Deliberate shooting in response to depredation may also occur in a number of areas. Oleson <em>et al</em>. (2010) noted, for example, that in Hawaii fishermen have reported shooting at False Killer Whales or other dolphins in response to depredation. Anderson (2014) noted that False Killer Whales are likely being shot by tuna longline fishermen in the Indian Ocean.<br/><br/>Although there is considerable controversy regarding the absolute extent of declines, there is good evidence of large-scale reductions in many predatory fish populations (e.g., Baum <em>et al</em>. 2003, 2005, Sibert <em>et al</em>. 2006, Polacheck 2006), including Yellowfin and Bigeye Tuna in the western and central Pacific (Harley <em>et al</em>. 2009; Langley <em>et al</em>. 2009). In addition to overfishing, expansion in the extent of unproductive areas and other ecosystem changes (e.g., Polovina <em>et al</em>. 2008, Coll <em>et al</em>. 2008, Koslow <em>et al.</em> 2015) have the potential to influence fish populations at multiple trophic levels. The effects of such reductions of fish populations and subsequent ecosystem changes on populations of False Killer Whales worldwide are unknown but could have resulted in population declines.<br/><br/>Studies of persistent organic pollutants in the main Hawaiian Islands insular population have revealed that all adult males and a number of adult females sampled from the population have levels of PCBs that exceed thresholds thought to cause immunosuppression (Ylitalo <em>et al</em>. 2009, Foltz <em>et al</em>. 2014). Evidence from stranded individuals of several similar species indicates that they have swallowed discarded plastic items, which may eventually lead to death (e.g. Scott <em>et al</em>. 2001); False Killer Whales may also be at risk from this threat.</p><p></p>","<p>Density of False Killer Whales is highest in low latitudes; in the eastern North Pacific, for example, density drops by an order of magnitude north of approximately 15°N (Ferguson and Barlow 2003). Abundance estimates are available for a number of areas, and in general False Killer Whales are among the least abundant delphinids even in their highest density areas (Wade and Gerrodette 1993, Ballance and Pitman 1998). In the eastern tropical Pacific, in an area of 19.1 million km², False Killer Whale abundance was estimated as 38,900 (coefficient of variation (CV) 0.64) based on line-transect surveys from 1986-1991 (Wade and Gerrodette 1993). In the western North Pacific, in an area of 2.9 million km², abundance was estimated as 16,668 (CV 0.26) based on line-transect surveys from 1983-1991 (Miyashita 1993). Kasuya (2017) subdivided this estimate based on region, and noted for coastal Japan (30°-42°N and west of 145°E) the abundance was estimated as 2,029 (95% confidence interval (CI) 907-4,541). In the Gulf of Mexico, there are three False Killer Whale abundance estimates based on line-transect surveys: 381 (CV 0.62) for 1991-1994, 1,038 (CV 0.71) for 1996-2001, and 777 (CV 0.56) for 2003-2004 (Waring <em>et al.</em> 2013). For U.S. waters of the western North Atlantic, abundance was estimated as 442 (CV 1.06) based on a survey in 2011 (Waring <em>et al</em>. 2015). In the western Indian Ocean, the False Killer Whale ranked 11th out of 13 species of delphinids in relative abundance (Ballance and Pitman 1998), based on a line-transect survey in 1995. Abundance off New Zealand was estimated as 111 individuals based on mark-recapture analyses of photo-identification data collected during 2005-2012 (Zaeschmar 2014).<br/><br/>The only region where abundance estimates have been apportioned by stock is within the U.S. EEZ around the Hawaiian Archipelago. The abundance estimate for the main Hawaiian Islands insular stock based on mark-recapture analyses of photo-identified animals was 167 individuals (standard error 23) in 2015 (Bradford <em>et al</em>. 2018). This is the only population where trend information is available, and several lines of evidence suggest that abundance in the 1980s was much higher, likely in the 400-700 range (Reeves <em>et al</em>. 2009, Oleson <em>et al</em>. 2010), which would indicate a substantial long-term decline. More recent trend (i.e., 2000s through 2015) is unknown due to the variability associated with recent abundance estimates (Bradford <em>et al</em>. 2018). Abundance of the insular stock in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands, in an area of 0.4 million km², was estimated as 552 individuals (CV 1.09) based on a line-transect survey in 2010 (Bradford <em>et al</em>. 2014b). The abundance of the pelagic stock within the entire U.S. EEZ around the Hawaiian Archipelago (an area of 2.3 million km²) was estimated as 1,540 individuals (CV 0.66) based on a 2010 line-transect survey although vessel attraction was not accounted for and this therefore may have led to overestimation of abundance (Bradford <em>et al</em>. 2014b). Although no abundance estimate was given, Anderson (2014) noted that the numbers of False Killer Whales around the Maldives had decreased over a 20-year period and that it may have been due to interactions with longline fisheries in the area.<br/><br/>The generation length for False Killer Whales was estimated at 25 years by Oleson <em>et al</em>. (2010), thus three generations is 75 years. The only subpopulation with sufficient evidence to assess trends over more than one generation is the main Hawaiian Island insular population, where there is evidence of a greater than 50% decline in less than two generations (Oleson <em>et al</em>. 2010).</p>",Unknown,"False Killer Whales are found in tropical to warm temperate zones, generally in relatively deep, offshore waters in all three major oceans. Densities are much higher in tropical regions and movements into higher latitudes may be associated with warmer currents, or they could be seasonal (Zaeschmar 2014). False Killer Whales do not generally range into latitudes higher than 50° in either hemisphere. They are found in many semi-enclosed seas and bays, including the Sea of Japan, Bohai/Yellow Sea, Timor Sea, Arafura Sea, Red Sea, and Persian Gulf, but they are observed only occasionally in the Mediterranean Sea (Notarbartolo di Sciara <em>et al.</em> 2017, Baldwin <em>et al</em> 1999, Leatherwood <em>et al</em>. 1989). There are a few records for the Baltic Sea, which are considered extralimital (Aguayo 1978).","<p>False Killer Whales are taken in hand-harpoon and drive hunts as well as small-type whaling (with a cannon mounted on a vessel below a certain size limit) in Japan (Kishiro and Kasuya 1993, Kasuya 2017). They are also hunted at least opportunistically in Indonesia (Barnes 1991) and the West Indies (Caldwell and Caldwell 1975). Quotas remain for takes of False Killer Whale in drive fisheries and hand-harpoon fisheries in Japan (Kasuya 2017). Although there is no legal hunting of False Killer Whales in the Republic of Korea, meat from False Killer Whales has been represented in markets at significantly higher rates than expected based on reports of bycaught animals (Baker <em>et al</em>. 2006). Based on their analysis, Baker <em>et al</em>. (2006) suggested that the False Killer Whales must be killed at a rate 10-times greater than the reported bycatch.<br/><br/>Some of the animals caught in the drive hunt or bycaught in Japan have been kept alive and sold to oceanaria (Kasuya <em>et al</em>. 1984) and a few were live-captured in California and Hawaii as recently as the 1970s (Reeves and Leatherwood 1984).</p><p></p>",Marine,"<p>The False Killer Whale is listed in Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES), and under the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS).<br/><br/>The main Hawaiian Islands insular stock (subpopulation) was listed as endangered under the U.S. Endangered Species Act in 2012. A number of “biologically important areas” have been recognized for the main Hawaiian Islands insular stock (Baird <em>et al</em>. 2015). Critical habitat for this stock was designated in 2018 as part of a settlement from a lawsuit. Both the Hawaiian pelagic stock and the main Hawaiian Islands insular stock are subjects of a False Killer Whale Take Reduction Plan as required by the U.S. Marine Mammal Protection Act that went into effect in 2013, in an attempt to reduce bycatch in the Hawaii-based longline fisheries to a level below its calculated potential biological removal. The Take Reduction Plan includes both gear changes (mandating “weak” circle hooks with a maximum wire diameter of 4.5 mm and “strong” branchlines, with a minimum diameter of 2.0 mm) as well as handling guidelines to try to allow hooks to straighten, releasing animals from the gear. In addition, prior to the Take Reduction Plan the longline exclusion area around the main Hawaiian Islands would seasonally contract towards the islands for four months of the year, but the Take Reduction Plan removed that seasonal shift, thus reducing overlap between the longline fishery and the main Hawaiian Islands insular stock. Overall however, as of April 2018, serious injury and mortality rates in the Hawaii-based longline fishery (with the vast majority from the Hawaii pelagic stock of False Killer Whales) had not declined.</p><p></p>",Afrotropical|Australasian|Indomalayan|Nearctic|Neotropical|Oceanian|Palearctic,,false,false,Global

Burrows are dug for breeding under tussock grass, low scrub and on the Snares Islands under <em>Olearia</em> forest. Birds typically do not return to their natal colonies until the age of four. The species feeds on fish, crustacea and cephalopods, which are caught while diving. Short (1-3 days) and long (5-15 days) provisioning trips are made by parents; longer trips allow foraging along the Antarctic Polar Front, reducing competition close to breeding grounds and allowing vast colonies to persist&#160;(Weimerskirch 1998).<p></p><p></p>","<p>The species is at risk from incidental capture in longline, trawl and gill-net fisheries and suffers the additional effects of depletion of prey stocks (Uhlmann 2003). A large number of deaths occur as a result of interaction with fisheries both during the breeding season and the winter migration to the Northern Hemisphere (Uhlmann 2003). The species is also subject to direct persecution, and harvesting of young birds ('muttonbirding') currently accounts for the take of around a quarter of a million birds annually (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992, Heather and Robertson 1997, Newman <em>et al.</em> 2008, 2009), but is unlikely to account for the scale of the observed decline. </p>  <p>Past investigation into the biological impact of climatic trends led to predictions of large-scale shifts in foraging distribution during the boreal summer and/or dramatic reductions in abundance and survival rate (Ainley <em>et al.</em> 1995, Veit <em>et al.</em> 1996, 1997, Spear and Ainley 1999, Wahl and Tweit 2000, Oedekoven <em>et al</em>. 2001, Hyrenbach and Veit 2003). Climate change is already affecting the foraging distribution of this species along the Californian coast (Veit <em>et al.</em> 1997). Evidence shows that birds are still visiting many of the same foraging areas, but are taking new routes to avoid altered current systems (Veit <em>et al</em>. 2003).

In Australia, there are colonies on 17 islands, all of which contain fewer than 1,000 pairs. In southern Chile, some colonies number up to 200,000 pairs, with the largest colony of up to 4 million individuals on Isla Guafo (Reyes-Arriagada <em>et al.</em> 2007). In the Falklands (Malvinas), 10,000-20,000 pairs have been recorded. New Zealand supports more than 180 colonies. The global population totals at 4.4 million pairs, roughly equating to 19.0–23.6 million individuals (Newman <em>et al.</em> 2009, Waugh <em>et al. </em>2013). In 1970-1971, the colonies on the Snares Islands were estimated to support 2,750,000 breeding pairs (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992, Heather and Robertson 1997). Although this is an extremely numerous species, there are persistent signs of a current decline (Brooke 2004). In New Zealand, the number of burrows in the largest colony on the Snares Islands declined by 37% between 1969-1971 and 1996-2000, and burrow occupancy may also have declined, indicating that an overall population decline may have occurred (Warham and Wilson 1982, Scofield and Christie 2002, Scott <em>et al.</em> 2008). Some colonies on mainland New Zealand have declined, and several colonies on offshore islands, especially in northern New Zealand, have not responded to predator control (Gaze 2000, Jones 2000, Waugh <em>et al.</em> 2013). However, other colonies in southern New Zealand have responded to sustained pest management with increasing numbers (Newman <em>et al.</em> 2009).&#160;<br/><br/>The species migrates to the northern hemisphere during the austral winter (Shaffer<em> et al.</em> 2006, Hedd <em>et al.</em> 2012), and in the California Current, Sooty Shearwater numbers have fallen by 90% in the last 20 years (Veit <em>et al.</em> 1996).

On Henderson Island, has been recorded nesting in woodland behind beaches or in low fern scrub close to the island’s cliffs. Nesting is seasonal, with egg-laying between late May and early July. 50-day incubation period is completed in three stints. The male takes the first stint, averaging 19.3 days, following a similar stint by the female, and then the male for the second time. Egg-hatching normally occurs towards the end of the male’s second stint (Brooke 2010). Off-duty incubating birds can travel over 4,800 km from Henderson towards the coast of Peru (Clay <em>et al. </em>2017).

For this reason, the species is assessed under criterion A1, not under A2, A3 or A4. Assuming a 31-year generation time, the 3-generation window for criterion A is the period 1926-2018. The global mature population size in 1926 was probably around 140,000. The current global mature population size is uncertain but likely to be in the range 5,000-15,000. This corresponds to a reduction of 89%-97%, which overlaps the boundary of Critically Endangered and Endangered with respect to past reduction under the A1 criterion (90% reduction over three generations). Given the evidence of increase in those regions where the species was most depleted (Antarctic and North Atlantic), Endangered (A1abd) seems the most appropriate category at this time, taking into account both the current population level and the likely global trend. The dominant contribution to the reduction in the global population was the massive reduction of the formerly very large Antarctic population. The Antarctic subspecies (<em>B. m. intermedia</em>)&#160;is included in this assessment, but is also separately listed as Critically Endangered.</p>  <p></p>  <p></p>","<p>Blue Whales feed almost exclusively on euphausiids (krill), with a variety of species being taken by different Blue Whale populations, such as <em>Euphausia superba</em> in the Antarctic, <em>Nyctiphanes australis</em> off southern Australia (Gill 2002), <em>Euphausia recurva</em> off Western Australia (J. Bannister pers. comm. 2007), <em>Nyctiphanes simplex</em> off the Galápagos (Palacios 1999), <em>Euphausia pacifica</em> and <em>Thysanoessa</em> spp. in the North Pacific (Fiedler <em>et al.</em> 1998), and <em>Meganyctiphanes norvegica </em>and <em>Thysanoessa </em>spp. in the North Atlantic (Visser <em>et al.</em> 2011, McQuinn <em>et al.</em> 2016). They feed both at the surface and at depths of up to 300 m (Sears and Calambokidis 2002, Calambokidis <em>et al.</em> 2007).<br/><br/>The migration patterns of Blue Whales are not well understood, but appear to be diverse. Although there is evidence of migratory behaviour in most of the populations studied, both wintering and summering areas appear to be occupied at some level throughout the year. Some individuals may reside year-round in habitats of year-round high productivity, while others undertake long migrations from tropical waters to high-latitude feeding grounds, but possibly stopping to feed in areas of high productivity on route, while yet others may undertake more limited migrations (Branch <em>et al.</em> 2007b, Gill <em>et al.</em> 2011, de Vos <em>et al.</em> 2014, Silva <em>et al.</em> 2013, Torres 2013, Lesage <em>et al.</em> 2017).</p>","<p>The main threat to Blue Whales in the past was direct exploitation, which only became possible on a regular basis in the modern era using deck-mounted harpoon cannons. Modern Blue Whale hunting started in the North Atlantic in 1868 and spread to other regions after the northeastern Atlantic population had been severely reduced, and whaling was temporarily banned in Norway from 1905 and in Iceland from 1915 (Tønnessen and Johnsen 1982). The Antarctic and North Atlantic populations were each probably depleted to the low hundreds by the time whaling ceased in the 1960-1970s, but have increased since. Blue Whales have been legally protected worldwide since 1966, although they continued to be caught illegally by former USSR fleets until 1972. The last recorded deliberate catches were off Spain in 1978 (Allison 2017).<br/><br/>Blue Whales in a calving ground off southern Sri Lanka appears to be especially subject to ship strikes, as indicated by both direct observations of strikes and strandings that exhibit blunt trauma (Ilangakoon 2012, de Vos <em>et al</em>. 2016) and observations of living animals that appear to have injuries that prevent normal swimming (IWC 2018b). The large volume of ship traffic around the southern coast of Sri Lanka makes it one of the busiest ocean-going shipping lanes in the world, but Priyadasharnha <em>et al.</em> (2016)&#160;showed that the expected frequency of ship strikes on Blue Whales would be greatly reduced by moving the lanes slightly further offshore.<br/><br/>Nine deaths of Blue Whales plus some serious injuries were attributed to ship strikes on the west coast of North America during 2007-13 (Carretta <em>et al</em>. 2017). Of 21 carcasses of Blue Whales found off California during 1988-2007, eight were found to have been killed by ship strike (Berman-Kowalewski <em>et al.</em> 2010).&#160;This suggests that ship strikes represent a substantial addition to natural mortality (Rockwood <em>et al.</em> 2017).&#160;Monnahan <em>et al</em>. (2015), on the other hand, argued that ship strikes have only a small effect on this population.&#160;As of 2018 this issue had not been resolved.<br/><br/>Of the Blue Whales in the Gulf of Saint Lawrence photo-identification catalogue, 16% appear to have scars or wounds resulting from ship strikes (Sears and Calambokidis 2002).<br/><br/>McKenna <em>et al.</em> (2015) concluded from tracking data that Blue Whales do not demonstrate effective avoidance behaviour when ships are near.&#160;However, Priyardashana <em>et al.</em> (2016) showed, based on densities of whales and shipping, that the expected frequency of ship strikes off southern Sri Lanka would be an order of magnitude higher than current estimates if the Blue Whales took no evasive action.<br/><br/>Incidental catches of Blue Whales in fisheries appear to be rare. The only reported cases this century were one in the northeastern Pacific in 2015 and one in the Gulf of Saint Lawrence in 2002. Blue whales in cold waters often have marks or scars caused by contact with ice, which can make it harder to identify scars caused by contact with fishing gear.<br/><br/>The main food of Antarctic Blue Whales, <em>Euphausia superba</em> and <em>E. crystallorophias</em><em>,</em> are predicted to decline during the 21<sup>st</sup> century due both to reduced ocean productivity associated with warming (Piñones and Fedorov 2016) and to increasing ocean acidity that limits their shell-building (Kawaguchi <em>et al.</em> 2013).&#160; Comparable changes are likely in other oceans.</p>","<p><strong><em>North Atlantic</em></strong><br/>Nearly 11,000 Blue Whales were specifically recorded as taken in the North Atlantic since the start of modern whaling in northern Norway in the 1860s, but an additional 13,000 unspecified large whales were recorded as caught in the late 19th and early 20th centuries (Allison 2017), of which perhaps 30% could have been Blue Whales based on specified catches in the same areas in the same and following years. In addition, whaling in the earlier years (pre-1916) is thought to have involved substantial struck-and-lost rates (IWC 2010, 2017b) such that the total number of Blue Whales killed in the North Atlantic was probably in the range 15-20,000.<br/><br/>Catches started off the coast of Finnmark, northern Norway, where it is likely that over 3,000 Blue Whales were taken before whaling was banned from mainland Norway in 1905. Operations spread to Svalbard, where over 1,000 Blue Whales were taken, and to Iceland where probably over 5,000 were taken before whaling was banned for about 20 years starting in 1916 due to noticeably declining abundance. Over 2,000 Blue Whales were taken off Newfoundland, about 500 in the Gulf of St Lawrence and nearly 1,000 around the Faeroes, Scotland, and Ireland. Very few Blue Whales were caught off Spain and Portugal. After the main period of whaling, low-level catches throughout the range probably impeded recovery until catches all but ceased around 1960. The last recorded directed catches  were six Blue  Whales taken off Spain in 1978,  three by pirate whaling vessels, and three  by catchers boats working for land stations (Allison  2017).<br/><br/>Post-whaling abundance estimates for the central and eastern North Atlantic (Iceland, Denmark Strait, southeastern Greenland, Jan Mayen, Faeroes and the British Isles and the Norwegian and Barents Seas) rose from 298 (coefficient of variation (CV) 0.25) in 1987 to 1,012 (CV 0.23) in 2001 (Pike <em>et al</em>. 2009). The increasing trend is consistent with a previous trend detected in sighting rates from Icelandic whaling vessels during 1969-88 (Sigurjónsson and Gunnlaugsson 1990). The Blue Whales in these surveys were most abundant west of Iceland, but with a shift to the northeast of Iceland in recent years (Víkingsson <em>et al</em>. 2015) and around Jan Mayen and Svalbard. Blue Whales are now very rare along the coast of Norway despite large catches there in the past. Further surveys of this area were conducted in 2007 and 2014-16 but the data have not yet been analysed to produce updated estimates of Blue Whale abundance (NAMMCO 2017).<br/><br/>Too few Blue Whales were observed in a survey of the Canadian Atlantic in 2007 to estimate abundance (Lawson and Gosselin 2009) and none were seen in US waters in 2011 surveys (Palka 2012).<br/><br/>Only one Blue Whale was seen (west of Cap Finisterre) during the summer 2016 SCANS III surveys which covered UK waters, the North Sea, English Channel, Bay of Biscay, and the Atlantic waters of France and Spain (Hammond <em>et al.</em> 2017). By comparison, over 1,000 Fin Whales (<em>Balaenoptera physalus</em>) were seen. These results suggest a Blue Whale summer abundance in the area only in the tens. A separate survey of waters south-west of Ireland in 2013 (Baines <em>et al.</em> 2017) recorded16 Blue Whales (including resightings), and the data suggest that about 10-20 individuals were present. A Blue Whale seen in southeastern Biscaya in 2016 was the first live sighting off Spain since the last catches in the 1970s (Covelo <em>et al.</em> 2017). <br/><br/>About 500 individual Blue Whales were photo-identified in the Gulf of Saint Lawrence during 1979-2015 (Sears <em>et al.</em> 2015). In view of the long time period, many of the animals in the catalogue are likely no longer alive. The Northeast Atlantic photo-id catalogue contained over 500 individuals by 2015, including 125 collected off Iceland during 1995-2005 and 335 in the Azores during 2002-15. The catalogues have not yet yielded estimates of abundance.<br/><br/><strong><em>North Pacific</em></strong><br/>About 9,000 Blue Whales were recorded as caught in the North Pacific, in addition to over 7,000 unspecified whales, some of which would have been Blue Whales (Allison 2017). The Blue Whale was protected by the International Whaling Commission (IWC) from 1966, but a further 760 Blue Whales were taken illegally by USSR fleets until 1972 (Doroshenko 2000, Ivashchenko <em>et al</em>. 2017)<br/><br/>The best estimate of abundance for the eastern North Pacific population, from&#160;photographic capture-recapture with an allowance for heterogeneity, is 1,647 (CV 0.07) (Calambokidis and Barlow 2013). Using the estimated catch history, including the assignment of a portion of the past catches in the Gulf of Alaska to the eastern North Pacific population, Monnahan <em>et al. </em>(2015) concluded that the eastern North Pacific population had recovered to near its pre-whaling abundance, estimated to be 1,750-2,500 whales. The population seems to have been roughly stable since the early 1990s (Carretta <em>et al.</em> 2017).<br/><br/>The international POWER (Pacific Ocean Whale and Environment) surveys covered the North Pacific east of 170°E and north of 40°N up to the Aleutian chain and the Alaska coast during 2010-12 (IWC 2018a). A total of 16 Blue Whales were seen. No abundance estimate has been calculated but the survey results suggest an abundance in the range 500-1,500, but which possibly includes some of the animals that are included in the above mark-recapture estimate. Only one Blue Whale was seen during the 2013-16 POWER surveys which covered the area between 20°N and 40°N. No Blue Whales were sighted in surveys of coastal British Columbia waters during 2004-08 (Best <em>et al.</em> 2015).<br/><br/>In the northwestern Pacific, Hakamada and Matsuoka (2016) estimated the late summer abundance in 2008 west of 170°E and north of 35°N at about 1,000 whales (CV ~0.5). The survey did not include the waters within the Russian Exclusive Economic Zone along the Kuril chain and Kamchatka, where Blue Whales also occur in summer (Miyashita 2006).<br/><br/>Blue Whales remain rare or absent in the Bering and Okhotsk Seas (Miyashita <em>et al.</em> 1996, Miyashita 2006, Friday et al. 2013), and very few historical catches are recorded from these areas.<br/><br/>Although over 2,000 Blue Whales were taken by coastal whaling in Japan until the 1960s, no Blue Whales were seen around Japan and in the North Pacific west of 155°E in extensive scouting vessel surveys during 1964-90 (Miyashita <em>et al.</em> 1996).&#160; Blue Whales were seen from 145°E eastward in surveys conducted during 1994-2015, but not near the coast of Japan (Matsuoka <em>et al.</em> 2016). <em><br/><br/><strong>Eastern South Pacific and eastern equatorial Pacific</strong></em><br/>A total of 5,276 Blue Whales were reported as caught in the eastern South Pacific including equatorial waters in the 20<sup>th</sup> century (Allison 2017). Allowing for some Blue Whales among the unspecified catches and for some level of struck and lost animals, and a lack of catch records for some whaling operations, the likely total kill is in the range 6,000-7,000. However, about 1,000 animals which were taken in equatorial waters during the austral summer/northern winter may have consisted partly of animals from the North Pacific populations. Furthermore, in the first half of the 20<sup>th</sup> century, Antarctic Blue Whales were much more abundant than today, hence a significant portion of early catches off Peru and Chile, especially in the austral winter, may have been of Antarctic Blue Whales.<br/><br/>For the first 60 years of modern whaling, catches of Blue Whales off Chile and Peru averaged only 60 per year but catches increased from 1964 for meat exports, and 964 whales were taken during 1964-67, between 19°-39°S. Following a recommendation by the Comisión Permanente del Pacífico Sur (the international body responsible for regulating whaling in the southeastern Pacific at the time) (CPSS 1966) catching of Blue Whales were suspended in Peru after the 1966 season and in Chile after the 1966/67 season. Clarke <em>et al</em>. (1978) cited the high catches off Peru and Chile at a time when the Antarctic Blue Whale stock was reduced to less than 1,000, as evidence that the Chilean and Peruvian whales were not from the Antarctic population, an observation that was later confirmed (see <em>Geographic Range</em> above). Sighting rates of Blue Whales from Peruvian and Chilean whaling vessels apparently remained reasonably high after catches of this species ceased (Valdivia <em>et al</em>. 1984, Maturana 1982), but the high catches of the mid-1960s would probably have been unsustainable if they had been allowed to continue.<br/><br/>A survey conducted under the IDCR (International Decade of Cetacean Research) programme in November-December 1982 between 10°S and 10°N from the coasts of Peru and Ecuador out to 110°W resulted in 16 Blue Whale sightings, all within 100 nm of the coast (Donovan 1984), but the survey coincided with the onset of an especially severe El Niño event.<br/><br/>A survey conducted under the international SOWER (Southern Ocean Whale and Environmental Research) programme during December-January 1997/98 covered the area between 12-200nm off the Chile coast between 18°S and 38°S and resulted in an abundance estimate of 303 Blue Whales (95% confidence interval (CI) = 176-625) for this area (Williams <em>et al.</em> 2011). Most Blue Whale sightings were between 27°S-33°S.&#160; A mark-recapture estimate using photo-id data collected around Chiloé Island (42°S) during 2004-11 yielded an estimate of 450 whales (CV 0.17) in 2008 with no significant trend (Cooke and Jackson 2017) but it is unclear what population this estimate pertains to because it includes both resident and transient individuals. Only one match was found between the 23 “individuals” (actually: left or right sides) identified on the SOWER cruise and the 563 “individuals” identified around Chiloé Island&#160;(IWC 2017a), which suggests that the whales either belong to distinct groups or to quite a large common population. Likewise, only one match was found between the Chiloé whales and the Blue Whales individually identified off Chañaral (29°S) (Galletti Vernazzani <em>et al</em>. 2017). The overall abundance and trend of Chilean Blue Whales is currently uncertain. Williams <em>et al</em>. (2011 revised 2017) show possible population trajectories from the early 20<sup>th</sup> century to the present<span class=""MsoCommentReference"">. <em><br/><br/><strong>Southern Indian Ocean and Southwest Pacific</strong></em><strong><br/> </strong>No comprehensive estimate of the population of Pygmy Blue Whales is available. From a survey in December 1996, Best <em>et al.</em> (2003) estimated the abundance of Pygmy Blue Whales in a survey area south of Madagascar to be 424 (confidence limits about 190-930) and suggested, based on the distribution of past catches, that the total population in the southwestern Indian Ocean was about three times that in the survey area. The Western Australia population has been estimated&#160;at 662-1,559 based on acoustic recordings during 2000-2006 (McCauley and Jenner 2010), and 712-1,754 based on photo-identification during 2000-2005 (Jenner <em>et al.</em> 2008). However, these estimates do not cover the full range of the species in the southeastern Indian Ocean, and updated estimates based on photo-identification and genetic recapture are in preparation (IWC 2017a). A total of 31 distinct blue whales were identified in New Zealand waters during 2004-2014 (Olson <em>et al</em>. 2015) and a population estimate is currently in preparation. The catch of over 9,500 Pygmy Blue Whales in the southern Indian Ocean in the period 1960-72 (Allison 2017) suggests that the initial population was at least this size, and hence that the current population is still depleted, but not as severely as that of the Antarctic Blue Whale.<em><br/><br/><strong>Northern Indian Ocean</strong></em><br/>Mikhalev (2000) documented 1,294 Pygmy Blue Whales caught illegally by Soviet fleets in the northern and equatorial Indian Ocean during 1963-66, mainly in the Gulf of Aden, north of the Seychelles, off the Maldive Islands and Laccdive Islands, and west of southern India and Sri Lanka. Priyadarshana <em>et al</em>. (2016) estimated a population size of 270 whales (CV 0.09) in a 7,500 km² area off southern Sri Lanka, which probably does not cover the full extent of this area of occurrence. No other abundance estimates in the Northern Indian Ocean are available.<em><br/><br/><strong>Antarctic</strong></em><br/>Catch records did not distinguish between subspecies until biologists accompanying Japanese and Russian whaling fleets started recording them separately from the 1960s (Ichihara 1966, Doroshenko 2000). Branch <em>et al.</em> (2009) concluded that virtually all of the Blue Whales taken south of 52°S in the southern Indian Ocean sector were Antarctic Blue Whales. The catch history of the various subspecies can be approximately reconstructed by assuming that Blue Whales not specified to subspecies taken south of 52°S or in the South Atlantic were <em>B. m. intermedia</em>, that Blue Whales taken off the west coast of South America were Chilean Blue Whales, and that Blue Whales not specified to subspecies taken in the northern Indian Ocean or in the Indian Ocean or the western South Pacific north of 52°S in the austral summer were Pygmy Blue Whales (understood here to include both <em>B. m. brevicauda</em> and <em>B. m. indica</em>). This leaves just a few hundred early catches in the southern Indian Ocean of doubtful identity.<em> </em>Allowing for some of the unspecified (to species) catch to have been Blue Whales, and for some struck and lost whales in the early years, the estimated total historical kill is about 350,000 Antarctic Blue Whales and 14,000 Pygmy Blue Whales (<em>B .m. brevicauda</em> and/or <em>B. m. indica</em>). These figures include the approximately 9,400 Blue Whales taken illegally by Soviet fleets in the 1960s and early 1970s that were not reported at the time (Ivashchenko <em>et al.</em> 2011), of which about 80% were Pygmy Blue Whales based on the above criteria.<br/><br/>The most recent circumpolar estimate of abundance for Antarctic Blue Whales agreed by the IWC Scientific Committee is 2,280 (CV 0.36) in 1998, based on sightings south of 60°S in summer, with an estimated annual increase rate of 8.1% (95% CI 1.6%-14.9%) (Branch 2007). A recalculation of the increase rate using more years of data is in progress (IWC 2017a).<br/><br/>An estimate from Japanese surveys covering just half of the Antarctic (35°E to 145°W) south of 60° S is 1,223 (CV 0.35) in 2008, with an estimated annual increase rate reported as 8.3% (95% CI 3.9% - 12.5%) (Matsuoka and Hakamada 2014). However, the annual increase rate implied by the presented data is 6.6% with a wide confidence interval (95% CI 0.0%-13.2%).<br/><br/>Photo-identification of Antarctic Blue Whales during 1991-2016 yielded 441 distinct individuals of which 14 were re-sighted in different years (Olson <em>et al.</em> 2016).&#160; The number of inter-annual re-sightings is too small for reliable estimation of abundance and trends, but is broadly consistent with the above circumpolar abundance estimate.</p><p><br/><strong><em>Assessment</em></strong><br/>The IWC Scientific Committee in 2008 accepted a stock assessment of Antarctic Blue Whales by T. Branch (IWC 2009). However, the assessment is redone here because the Committee's assessment did not use an age-structured model and thus could not estimate the numbers of mature individuals that are required for the IUCN Red List assessment. The historical catch data have also been revised since then (Allison 2017).<br/><br/>The age at first reproduction is not well-known for Blue Whales in general, but Sears <em>et al.</em> (2013) found a youngest age of 11 years for first known calvings of female Blue Whales in the eastern North Pacific. This agrees with the estimate of 11 years  by Taylor <em>et al.</em> (2007) from inter-specific comparisons. The generation time was estimated by Taylor <em>et al.</em> to be 30.8 years, which corresponds to a 3-generation period from 1926-2018 for application of the A criterion for the Red List.<br/><br/>Plausible rates of natural increase, taking into account the age at maturity and reproductive rates have been estimated to be 4.1% per year (Branch 2008a) for Antarctic Blue Whales and 2% per year for Pygmy Blue Whales, which appear to have a lower reproductive rate (Branch 2008b). Taylor <em>et al.</em> (2007) inferred an intrinsic increase rate of 5% for Blue Whales and estimated the proportion mature to be 72% for a stable population or 48% for a population increasing at the intrinsic rate.    </p><p>For Antarctic Blue Whales, a 5% intrinsic increase rate with logistic density-dependence, and&#160;assuming a 5 year mean age at recruitment, as for Fin Whales, an annual natural survival rate of 0.975 (Ramp <em>et al.</em> 2006, Taylor <em>et al.</em> 2007), and a total population size of 2,280 whales in 1998, would imply a mature population size in 1926 of 125,000 or a total population size of 189,000, declining to a minimum of less than 1,000 in the late 1960s, and increasing to about 3,000 mature or 6,500 total by 2018 (see Supplementary Information).<br/><br/>As discussed above, there are no complete estimates of recent or current abundance for the other regions, but plausible total numbers would be 1,000-3,000 in the North Atlantic, 3,000-5,000 in the North Pacific, and possibly 1,000-3,000 in the eastern South Pacific. The number of Pygmy Blue whales is very uncertain but may be in the range 2,000-5,000. Taken together with a range of 5,000-8,000 in the Antarctic, the global population size in 2018 is plausibly in the range 10,000-25,000 total or 5,000-15,000 mature, compared with a 1926 global population of at least 140,000 mature. The current mature population would therefore be between 3 and 11% of the 1926 level. This overlaps the boundary (90% decline or 10% remaining) between the Endangered and Critically Endangered categories under criterion A1.<br/><br/>There is evidence of increasing abundance, at least up to around the year 2000, in the Antarctic and North Atlantic, and at least stability in the North Pacific. There is as yet no evidence of trend in the abundance of Pygmy Blue Whales or of Chilean Blue Whales, but it is likely that the global population of Blue Whales has increased in recent decades.</p>",Increasing,"<p>The Blue Whale is a cosmopolitan species, found in all oceans but absent from some regional seas such as the Mediterranean, Okhotsk, and Bering seas. Until the 1960s, evidence of Blue Whale distribution came primarily from commercial catches, subsequently from whaling vessels sightings, then in the 1980s and 1990s from dedicated sighting surveys and platforms of opportunity, and since the 2000s also from acoustic detections, especially of males.<br/><br/><strong><em>North Atlantic</em><em><br/> </em></strong>In the North Atlantic the summer distribution of Blue Whales extends in the west from the Scotian Shelf to the Davis Strait (Canada/Greenland) and into the Gulf of Saint Lawrence (Sears and Calambokidis 2002, Waring <em>et al</em>. 2010). Blue whales occur in the Denmark Strait, around Iceland and north to the ice edge, and in the northeast to and around Svalbard (Norway), but not far into the Barents Sea. Historically, Blue Whales were commonly caught along the coasts of northern and western Norway, the Faeroes, and to the north and west of Scotland and Ireland. Small numbers were caught off northwestern Spain&#160;and near the Strait of Gibraltar, but the species does not occur in the Mediterranean (Reeves and Notarbartolo di Sciara 2006).<br/><br/>The winter distribution is poorly known but Blue Whales may have been dispersed over much of the tropical and subtropical North Atlantic (Reeves <em>et al</em>. 2004). There have been winter sightings off the coast of Mauritania (Baines and Reichelt 2014).&#160; Blue Whales are regularly observed around the Azores in spring and at least some migrate northward from there (Silva <em>et al</em>. 2013). Blue Whales have been tracked from the Gulf of Saint Lawrence to the New England Seamounts and to the coasts of North and South Carolina (34°N) in winter (Lesage <em>et al</em>. 2017). There are virtually no records from the Gulf of Mexico or the Caribbean.<br/><br/>Photo-identification data show that there are two largely separate populations in the North Atlantic: the northwest Atlantic population occurs in summer in the Gulf of Saint Lawrence, on the Scotian Shelf, and around Newfoundland and west of Greenland. The northeast Atlantic population occurs in summer east of Greenland, around Iceland, Jan Mayen and Svalbard, and west of Ireland; in spring it occurs around the Azores and in winter off northwest Africa. About 500 individuals have been identified to date in each of the two populations, but so far only one crossover (from the Gulf of Saint Lawrence to the Azores) has been documented through photographic matching (Sears <em>et al</em>. 2015.<em><br/><br/><strong>North Pacific</strong></em><strong><br/></strong><em></em>Blue Whales occur in summer north of 35°N in the western North Pacific, and north of 40°N in the central North Pacific and Gulf of Alaska, but not in the Bering or Okhotsk Seas. In the eastern North Pacific, they occur year-round off Baja California, Mexico, and the California coast (Calambokidis and Barlow 2004). Analysis of song types suggest that Blue Whales in the eastern North Pacific are a separate population from those in the central and western North Pacific, but that whales from the eastern population mingle with whales from the western population in the Gulf of Alaska in summer (Monnahan <em>et al</em>. 2014). While some Blue Whales remain off California in winter, some of the Californian Blue Whales, including females with or without calves, migrate into the Gulf of California in winter (Sears <em>et al</em>. 2013). Some North Pacific Blue Whales migrate in winter to the Costa Rica dome (Mate <em>et al</em>. 1999)&#160; and perhaps further south into Peruvian waters (Le Duc <em>et al</em>. 2017).<em><br/><br/><strong>Eastern tropical Pacific (ETP) and eastern South Pacific</strong></em><br/>Blue Whales are present year-round on the Costa Rica Dome but it is unclear whether any animals are resident there, or whether it is sequentially occupied by whales wintering from the northeastern and southeastern Pacific (Reilly and Thayer 1990).<br/><br/>Sightings recorded by whalers taking other species show that Blue Whales were quite abundant during 1976-82 in the waters west of northern Peru (exact locations not given), especially in January-March, but with much reduced presence during the severe El Niño event of 1982-83 (Valdivia <em>et al</em>. 1984, Donovan 1984). Their presence in November-December from the coast out to well beyond the Galápagos Islands was also shown by sightings from Japanese scouting vessels during 1979-82 (Miyashita <em>et al</em>. 1996). Their presence in the waters of Ecuador and Peru was shown by tuna vessel surveys during October-March 1975-88 (Reilly and Thayer 1990) and later by dedicated cetacean surveys in July-December during 1986-2003 (Hamilton <em>et al</em>. 2009).<br/><br/>Blue Whales have been hunted in the past from several locations on the Chilean coast from 20°S to 42°S in all seasons (Allison 2017). Current areas of regular summer abundance include Chañaral (29°S) and Chiloé Island (42°-44°S) (Hucke-Gaete <em>et al</em>. 2004, Vernazzani <em>et al</em>. 2012). A summer survey in December-January 1997/98 of offshore waters 12-200 nm from the coast between 18°S and 38°S showed presence from 20°S southward, with most sightings between 27°S and 33°S (Williams <em>et al</em>. 2011).<br/><br/>Based on morphology, genetics and migration, Branch <em>et al</em>. (2007a) proposed that Chilean Blue Whales are a separate subspecies from <em>B. m. intermedia </em>and <em>B. m. brevicauda</em>. However, while Chilean Blue Whales are clearly distinct from the other Southern Hemisphere subspecies, the division between Chilean and North Pacific Blue Whales is not yet clear. LeDuc <em>et al</em>. (2017) found that most Blue Whales biopsy sampled during July-November on the Costa Rica Dome were genetically closer to whales sampled in the North Pacific, while most Blue Whales biopsy sampled in the same months off Ecuador and the Galápagos were genetically closer to whales sampled in Chilean waters, but there was a high degree of uncertainty in individual assignments to the two groups. There is movement between the two grounds, with individual whales matched or tracked between California and the Costa Rica Dome, between the Costa Rica Dome and the Galápagos, and between the Galápagos and southern Chile (IWC 2017a, Huecke-Gate <em>et al</em>. 2016). In Chilean waters, the seasonal distribution of acoustic detections suggests a migration to northerly tropical latitudes in winter, but calls typical of Chilean Blue Whales were also recorded year-round in the ETP (Buchan <em>et al</em>. 2015). Calls typical of Antarctic Blue Whales are detected in the ETP during the austral winter (Stafford <em>et al</em>. 1999, IWC 2017a). Clearly more research is needed to clarify the seasonal presence and distribution of the different groups of Blue Whales in the ETP, as the area is used by North Pacific, Chilean, and Antarctic Blue Whales, and there may also be resident individuals.<br/><br/>Calls typical of Antarctic Blue Whales have also been detected from January to June near Chiloé Island, but appeared to be from individuals making only brief visits to the area (Buchan <em>et al</em>. 2018).<em><br/><br/><strong>Southern Indian Ocean and southwestern Pacific</strong></em><br/><br/>Pygmy Blue Whales (<em>B. m. brevicauda</em>) occur north of 52°S, with very few or no individuals south of this latitude (Branch <em>et al</em>. 2007a, 2009). They occur off northwestern Madagascar (Cerchio <em>et al</em>. 2016), on the Madagascar plateau (Best <em>et al</em>. 2003), in the offshore waters of Kenya (Barber <em>et al</em>. 2016) around and north of the Seychelles (Mikhalev 2000), across the pelagic southern Indian Ocean, and off South Australia and Western Australia, where they form part of a more or less continuous distribution from Tasmania to Indonesia. The Blue Whales observed around New Zealand also appear to be Pygmy Blue whales, based on genetics (Sremba <em>et al</em>. 2015) and morphology (Olson <em>et al</em>. 2015). Blue Whales appear to be rare or absent in the central South Pacific between the New Zealand and Chilean areas of occurrence (Branch <em>et al</em>. 2007b).<br/><br/>Based on acoustic detections, Antarctic Blue Whales (<em>B. m. intermedia</em>) occur in the tropical and subtropical Indian Ocean only in winter and spring, while Pygmy Blue Whales occur year-round but with a tendency to move southward in the austral summer (Samaran <em>et al</em>. 2013). Other data are also broadly consistent with a lower-latitude distribution in the austral winter and a more southerly distribution in summer (Zemsky and Sazhinov 1982, cited by Best <em>et al</em>. 2003): Pygmy Blue Whales were present at the Seychelles in November but not April (Mikhalev 2000), and off Kenya in September and October but not during November to January (Barber <em>et al</em>. 2016). Foetuses found in the Pygmy Blue Whales taken by Soviet whalers near the Seychelles and in the southern Indian Ocean indicated that calves are born in the austral winter (Mikhalev 2000).<em><br/><br/><strong>Northern Indian Ocean</strong></em><strong> </strong><br/>Blue Whales are found year-round in the northern Indian Ocean, especially around Sri Lanka, and seasonally around the Maldive Islands and in the Gulf of Aden (Alling <em>et al</em>. 1991, Mikhaelev 2000, Stafford <em>et al</em>. 2011, Anderson <em>et al</em>. 2012). They occur virtually year-round off southern Sri Lanka but are most abundant during December to May and least abundant during July to September (Randage <em>et al</em>. 2014). Analyses of fetuses in Blue Whales taken by Soviet fleets in the Northern Indian Ocean (Mikhalev 2000) revealed no clear seasonality of reproduction, being consistent either with year-round reproduction or perhaps a bimodal pattern.<br/><br/>Anderson <em>et al</em>. (2012) considered that there is some east-west migration within the northern Indian Ocean, with peak occurrence in the western Arabian Sea in May-October, followed by dispersal eastward after the end of the southwest monsoon, past Sri Lanka and into the Bay of Bengal, with peak abundance northeast of Sri Lanka occurring in February and March. However, Samaran <em>et al</em>. (2013) found that call types detected off Sri Lanka were also heard in the southern Indian Ocean in December and January, at least as far south as 43°S, which suggests that some Blue Whales may migrate between Sri Lanka and the temperate southern Indian Ocean.<br/><br/>Although Blue Whales in the northern Indian Ocean are tentatively considered to be the distinct subspecies <em>B. m. indica</em>, their distinction from <em>B. m. brevicauda</em> is unclear. Mikhalev (2000) found the maximum body length, body length at maturity, and ovulation rate of Arabian Sea Blue Whales to be similar to Pygmy Blue Whales in the Southern Indian Ocean.<br/></p><strong><em>Antarctic and Southern Ocean</em></strong><br/>The Antarctic form <em>B. m. intermedia</em>, occurs throughout the Antarctic in summer, from the Antarctic Polar Front up to and into the sea ice, and in the subantarctic South Atlantic including the South Georgia area (Branch <em>et al</em>. 2007b). The winter distribution is not well known, but at least some and possibly most of the population migrates to lower latitudes in winter. Evidence for this comes from past catches of Antarctic-sized Blue Whales off Angola, Namibia, and South Africa in winter only (Branch <em>et al</em>. 2007b) and more recently from acoustics: call types characteristic of Antarctic Blue Whales have been recorded in the austral winter just north of the equator in the mid-Atlantic (Samaran <em>et al</em>. 2017),&#160; in the southeastern Atlantic on the west coast of South Africa (Bell 2016 ), in the tropical Indian Ocean and southwest Pacific Ocean (Balcazar <em>et al</em>. 2017), and near the Galápagos Islands (Stafford <em>et al</em>. 2004). However, there is also at least some winter presence in high latitudes (Ŝirović <em>et al</em>. 2009, Thomisch <em>et al</em>. 2016) and perhaps some summer presence in mid-latitudes of the Indian Ocean (Samaran <em>et al</em>. 2013) and southeastern Pacific (Buchan <em>et al</em>. 2018).","The Blue Whale was the subject of major commercial hunting in the past, which ceased in the 1970s.",Marine,"<p>Blue Whales have been protected from commercial hunting by the International Whaling Commission since 1966, although illegal catches by USSR fleets continued until 1972.

Where distinct ecotypes are known, the inshore form frequents estuaries, bays, lagoons and other shallow coastal regions, occasionally ranging far up into rivers. The offshore form tends to be less restricted in range and movement. Some Common Bottlenose Dolphins are residents around oceanic islands (Baird 2016). In many inshore areas Common Bottlenose Dolphins maintain definable, long-term, multi-generational home ranges, but in some locations near the extremes of the species’ range they are migratory. Off the coasts of North America, they tend to inhabit waters with surface temperatures ranging from about 10°C to 32°C (Wells and Scott, 1999). Black Sea Bottlenose Dolphins are common over the shelf of this semi-enclosed basin; they sometimes occur far offshore (Birkun 2006).<br/> <br/> Common Bottlenose Dolphins are commonly associated with many other cetaceans, including large whales and other dolphin species (Wells and Scott 1999). Mixed schools with Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphins have been observed, for instance, in the Taiwan Strait (J. Wang pers. comm.).<br/> <br/> Bottlenose Dolphins consume a wide variety of prey species, mostly fish and squid (Barros and Odell 1990, Barros and Wells 1998, Blanco <em>et al</em>. 2001, Santos <em>et al</em>. 2001). They sometimes eat shrimp and other crustaceans.</p>","<p>In many places Common Bottlenose Dolphins are found in coastal waters, bringing them into contact with human activities. Conservation problems are known or suspected for at least: (a) the Critically Endangered Fiordland Bottlenose Dolphin subpopulation in New Zealand (Currey <em>et al</em>. 2013), (b) the Endangered Black Sea Bottlenose Dolphin subspecies (Birkun 2012), (c) the Vulnerable Mediterranean Sea subpopulation (Bearzi <em>et al</em>. 2008, 2012), and the dolphins in (d) Sri Lanka (Leatherwood and Reeves 1989); (e) Peru, Ecuador, and Chile (Read <em>et al</em>. 1988, Van Waerebeek <em>et al</em>. 1990, Sanino <em>et al</em>. 2005, Mangel <em>et al</em>. 2010); (f) Taiwan (Wang <em>et al</em>. 1999 pers. comm.); (g) Japan (Kasuya 2017) and (h) Gulf of California, Mexico (Segura-García <em>et al.</em> 2018).&#160;</p>  <p>Dolphin catches for bait, for human consumption, or to reduce competition with fisheries have been reported worldwide (Wells and Scott 1999, 2018). In a global review of the use of cetaceans as bait in fisheries, Common Bottlenose Dolphins were among the most frequently used (Mintzer <em>et al.</em> 2018). They were reported as being used for bait in Ghana, Italy, Mexico, Nigeria, Venezuela and Spain. In Peru, some coastal artisanal fisheries from at least one port take <em>Common Bottlenose Dolphins</em> for bait, using harpoons, while about 57% of Common Bottlenose Dolphins caught in gillnets as bycatch are discarded at sea; the extent to which such takes occur elsewhere along the Peruvian coast is not known (Mangel <em>et al</em>. 2010). This species is taken opportunistically by harpoon in Sri Lanka (Ilangakoon 1997). In Taiwan, Common Bottlenose Dolphins comprised a major part of the small cetaceans taken by harpoon in the past (J. Wang, pers. comm.). Although little evidence has been collected and reported since the 1990s, illegal hunting of cetaceans still occurs in Taiwan as evidenced by periodic news reports of police confiscations of cetacean parts. Directed hunting of cetaceans, including Common Bottlenose Dolphins, for local consumption occurs in St. Vincent and the Grenadines (Caldwell and Caldwell 1975) and in West Africa (Van Waerebeek <em>et al</em>. 2008). The Common Bottlenose Dolphin is reported to be one of several species targeted by hunters in Indonesia (Mustika 2006). <br/> <br/> The only Mediterranean area with quantitative historical information is the northern Adriatic Sea, where Common Bottlenose Dolphins likely have declined by at least 50% over the past 50 years, largely as a consequence of historical killing in extermination campaigns to reduce competition for fish, followed by habitat degradation and overfishing. The extermination campaigns were conducted until the early 1960s (Bearzi <em>et al</em>. 2004, 2008, Bearzi and Fortuna 2006). For the northwestern Mediterranean, the available information suggests similar trends (Bearzi and Fortuna 2006). There continues to be substantial incidental mortality in fishing gear, and overfishing of dolphin prey, disturbance by marine traffic, and high levels of contamination by pollutants are of concern in much of the Mediterranean Sea (Bearzi <em>et al</em>. 2012).<br/> <br/> Drive hunts of small cetaceans, including Common Bottlenose Dolphins, exist in the Faroe Islands and Japan. Up to 308 are taken annually in the Faroe Islands drive hunt (dating back to 1803), often with Long-finned Pilot Whales (Reyes 1991, Bloch 1998). Drive and harpoon hunts in Japan catch Common Bottlenose Dolphins for human consumption and to remove perceived competition with commercial fisheries (Wells and Scott 1999, Kasuya 2017). Average catch from 1995–2004 was 594 per year (Kasuya 2017). Since 2000, the catch at Taiji in Japan has declined to fewer than 200 Common Bottlenose Dolphins per year, after a peak of 1,670 in 1987 (Kasuya 2017).<br/> <br/> The Endangered Black Sea subspecies was hunted extensively to obtain commercial products including oils, lubricants, food, meal, glue, and leather goods (Tomilin 1957, Buckland <em>et al</em>. 1992). An estimated 24,000 - 28,000 were taken in the Black Sea off Turkey during 1946–1983. However, the total number killed was certainly much greater (probably by tens of thousands) as these figures do not include, or only partially include, catch statistics from other Black Sea countries (Birkun 2006, 2012).<br/> <br/> The Common Bottlenose Dolphin is the most common cetacean species in captivity worldwide (Fisher and Reeves 2005). Live captures of Common Bottlenose Dolphins for public display, research, and military applications have occurred in several parts of the species' range. There is no worldwide estimate of the scale of these removals, but more than 1,500 were live-captured in United States, Mexican, and Bahamian waters through 1980 (Leatherwood and Reeves 1982, Fisher and Reeves 2005). Up to 1983 at least 198 Common Bottlenose Dolphins were reported to have been live-captured for European aquaria (Collet 1984). More recently, eight were collected illegally in the Dominican Republic in 2002 (Parsons <em>et al.</em> 2010) and live-capture efforts in Senegal in 2003 led to the death of at least five dolphins (Van Waerebeek <em>et al</em>. 2008). At least 238 Common Bottlenose Dolphins were live-captured in Cuba in 1986–2004 (Van Waerebeek <em>et al</em>. 2006), and 15 in the Solomon Islands in 2013 (Oremus <em>et al</em>. 2015). Some Common Bottlenose Dolphins captured during drive hunts in Japan are collected alive for marine parks in Japan and internationally (Butterworth <em>et al</em>. 2013). The cumulative live-capture removals of Black Sea Bottlenose Dolphins, not counting mortality during capture operations, is estimated to be from several hundred up to around 1,000 since the mid-1960s for military, academic, and display purposes, including swim-with-dolphins programs (Birkun 2002). Live-captures through 2002 took 10-20 animals annually from a small area in the Kerch Strait, Russia (Birkun 2002, 2006, 2012). According to Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) statistics, at least 92 individuals were removed from the Black Sea region during 1990-1999 (Reeves <em>et al</em>. 2003), and Russia reportedly exported at least 66 for travelling shows from 1997-2005 (Fisher and Reeves 2005). <br/> <br/> Incidental mortality of Common Bottlenose Dolphins is known to occur throughout the species’ range in set gillnets, drift gillnets, purse seines, trawls, and longlines, and on hook-and-line gear used in commercial and recreational fisheries, but the level of mortality is poorly documented from most range states (Wells and Scott 1999, Wells <em>et al.</em> 2008). Set gillnet, purse-seine and drift gillnet fisheries off Peru continue to take an unknown but potentially large number annually (Van Waerebeek <em>et al.</em> 2017b, Alfaro-Shigueto <em>et al</em>. 2010), and some of those taken as bycatch or directly were being sold in fish markets at least through 2007, as determined by molecular evidence (Tzika <em>et al</em>. 2010). Prior to 2001, the estimated annual incidental mortality of Common Bottlenose Dolphins in the eastern tropical Pacific purse seine fishery for tuna ranged up to almost 200 per year, but during 2001-2016, the average mortality declined to 2.9 per year (Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission data, M. Scott pers. comm.). Incidental catches in Chinese fisheries reached several hundred per year in the 1990s (Yang <em>et al</em>. 1999). Bottom trawls and sink gillnets in the mid-Atlantic region of the U.S. take on average 27 offshore Common Bottlenose Dolphins annually, pelagic longlines take 12 Common Bottlenose Dolphins on average each year (Hayes <em>et al</em>. 2017), and shrimp trawls take an unknown number each year (Greenman and McFee 2014). Common Bottlenose Dolphins were the third most frequently caught cetaceans in gillnets in Sri Lanka (Ilangakoon 1997). Taiwanese coastal and distant-water longline fisheries for tunas and sharks take Common Bottlenose Dolphins incidentally, as do a variety of Taiwanese gillnet (including driftnets and trammel nets) and purse-seine fisheries in coastal and distant (e.g., Western Tropical Pacific) waters (Wang and Yang 2002, J. Wang pers. comm.). <br/> <br/> Annual Black Sea Bottlenose Dolphin incidental mortality in bottom-set gillnets from 1946 through the 1980s was roughly estimated as being in the hundreds. The scale of this mortality almost certainly increased in the 1990s-2000s owing to the rapid expansion of illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing (Birkun 2006, 2012). According to Öztürk (1999) at least 200 Bottlenose Dolphins may have been taken incidentally per year in Turkish fisheries in a variety of fishing nets, especially bottom-set gill nets.&#160;</p>  <p>Common Bottlenose Dolphins in coastal areas are exposed to a wide variety of threats in addition to direct and incidental takes (Vollmer and Rosel 2013). Threats that are cause for concern include: 1) the toxic effects of xenobiotic chemicals; 2) reduced prey availability caused by environmental degradation and overfishing; 3) direct and indirect disturbance and harassment (e.g., boat traffic and commercial dolphin watching and interactive programs); 4) marine construction, including demolition, dredging, and land reclamation, and 5) other forms of habitat destruction and degradation (including anthropogenic noise). Although these and other threats are technically challenging to quantify by comparison with removals, their cumulative impact is likely to result in population declines. The contribution of anthropogenic factors to an increasing number of Unusual Mortality Events involving Common Bottlenose Dolphins remains to be determined (Spradlin <em>et al</em>. 2005).</p>  <p>The Critically Endangered Fiordland (New Zealand) Bottlenose Dolphin subpopulation faces threats from boat-based tourism, increased freshwater discharge from hydroelectric power generation, and reduced prey availability from environmental degradation and overfishing (Currey <em>et al</em>. 2013). </p>  <p>Environmental contaminants likely impact health and reproductive success of the Common Bottlenose Dolphins in parts of its range. Lahvis <em>et al</em>. (1995) correlated concentrations of PCBs and DDT in the blood of inshore Bottlenose Dolphins with decline in immune system function. Males in some areas such as Florida accumulate levels of PCBs more than an order of magnitude greater than the threshold for adverse health effects identified by Kannan <em>et al</em>. (2000). A risk assessment relative to PCB burdens suggested elevated probabilities of first-born mortality at several sites in the U.S. (Schwacke <em>et al</em>. 2002, Wells <em>et al</em>. 2005). Jepson <em>et al.</em> (2016) reported that Common Bottlenose Dolphins in Europe had mean PCB concentrations that greatly exceeded all known marine mammal PCB toxicity thresholds. The spatial patterns of PBDEs and the ΣDDTs/ΣPCBs detected in Common Bottlenose Dolphin blubber have been shown to vary significantly with adjacent watersheds and land use associations in the southeastern United States (Adams <em>et al.</em> 2014). </p>  <p>The <em>Deepwater Horizon</em> oil spill in 2010 was one of the worst environmental catastrophes in the history of the United States. The oil spill adversely impacted the health, reproduction, and survival of Common Bottlenose Dolphins along much of the northern coast of the Gulf of Mexico (Schwacke <em>et al</em>. 2014, Lane <em>et al</em>. 2015). For the stock in Barataria Bay, Louisiana, where oiling was heavy, the spill resulted in an estimated 30,347 lost cetacean years (the difference between baseline and injured population size, summed over the modeled time period) (95% CI: 11,511-89,746), and models suggested the time to recovery of the population would be 39 years (95% CI: 24 to 80) (Schwacke <em>et al</em>. 2017). Similar recovery timelines were predicted for other nearby stocks. There is concern that planned large-scale diversions of fresh water from the Mississippi River into Barataria Bay may hamper the recovery of this stock.</p>  <p>&#160;Common Bottlenose Dolphins sometimes forage around fish-farm cages or take fish from gillnets (e.g., Reeves <em>et al</em>. 2001, Read <em>et al</em>. 2003), commercial trawling gear, crab traps, or recreational fishing gear (Wells and Scott 1999). This can result in incidental mortality through entanglement, hooking, and ingestion of gear (Powell and Wells 2011, Wells <em>et al</em>. 2008, Baird 2016, Stolen <em>et al.</em> 2013). Common Bottlenose Dolphins conditioned to receive food items are more likely to be injured by human interactions than unconditioned dolphins, leading to decreased survival and potentially to consequences at the population level (Donaldson <em>et al</em>. 2010, Christiansen <em>et al</em>. 2016). Developments in recreational fishing line technology include microfilament braided twine that is more damaging to dolphin tissues than simple monofilament (Barco <em>et al</em>. 2010). Dredging and demolition associated with marine construction have been demonstrated to at least temporarily displace Common Bottlenose Dolphins from their normal range (Buckstaff <em>et al.</em> 2013, Pirotta <em>et al.</em> 2013).</p>  <p>Morbillivirus has been responsible for several documented epizootic events involving deaths of hundreds to thousands of Common Bottlenose Dolphins in the western North Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico (Rowles <em>et al</em>. 2011). During an outbreak along the U.S. Atlantic coast in 1987-88, more than 740 Common Bottlenose Dolphins died between New Jersey and Florida. During 2013-2015, more than 1,800 Common Bottlenose Dolphin carcasses were recovered during a morbillivirus event along the Atlantic coast from New York to Florida (NOAA/NMFS 2015). In each of these cases, it should be noted that only a fraction of the actual mortality is generally documented as stranded carcasses, so the number of deaths from the disease are likely much higher (Williams <em>et al</em>. 2011, Wells <em>et al</em>. 2015). It is not known if anthropogenic factors increase susceptibility to the disease.</p>","<p></p><p>Abundance of Common Bottlenose Dolphins has been estimated for several parts of the species' range. Summing available estimates, a minimum world-wide abundance estimate would be 750,000, acknowledging that most of the range of the species has not been surveyed for abundance estimation, and some of the estimates included in the summation are out of date.<br/> <br/> <a name=""_Hlk523388145"">Recent surveys by the U.S. National Marine Fisheries Service (Hayes <em>et al</em>. 2017) have estimated 97,964 Bottlenose Dolphins in the northern Gulf of Mexico <strong>(</strong>5,806 (coefficient of variation (CV) = 0.39) in oceanic waters beyond the shelf edge, 51,192 (CV = 0.10) on the outer continental shelf, 39,734 in coastal waters, and 1,232 in bays, sounds, and estuaries. There are approximately 110,000 Common Bottlenose Dolphins off the east coast of North America (including 77,532 (CV = 0.40) in offshore waters, 31,212 in coastal waters, and 1,209 in bays, sounds, and estuaries. For both regions, current estimates are not available for most of the bays, sounds, and estuaries (Hayes <em>et al</em>. 2017). Recent stock assessment reports for U.S. Pacific waters indicated that there are 453 (CV = 0.06) Common Bottlenose Dolphins in coastal California waters, and 1,924 (CV = 0.54) in the offshore waters of California, Oregon, and Washington (Carretta <em>et al.</em> 2017). These stock assessments include abundance estimates for individual stocks in Hawaiian waters: Kauai/Niihau, 147 (CV = 0.11), Oahu, 594 (CV = 0.54), 4-Islands, 153 (CV = 0.24), Hawaii Island, 102 (CV = 0.13), and Hawaii Pelagic, 5,590 (CV = 0.59) (Carretta <em>et al.</em> 2017). Surveys of the Eastern Tropical Pacific resulted in an estimate of 243,500 (CV = 0.29) (Wade and Gerrodette 1993), but this estimate should be considered with caution given the fact that it is more than 25 years old. No recent abundance estimates for Common Bottlenose Dolphins in Japanese waters are available (Kasuya 2017). Japanese surveys prior to 1993 resulted in estimates of 168,000 (CV = 0.26) in the Northwestern Pacific west of 180ºE, including 36,791 (CV = 0.25) in Japanese coastal waters (Miyashita 1993). In the eastern Sulu Sea, Dolar <em>et al.</em> (2006) estimated 2,628 Common Bottlenose Dolphins 1994-1995 (CV = 0.40). </a></p>  <p>A large-scale survey (SCANS-III) of European Atlantic waters from the Strait of Gibraltar in the south to 62°N in the north and extending west to the 200 nm limits of most European Union Member State Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZ) was conducted in 2016 (Hammond <em>et al</em>. 2017). The final surveyed area excluded offshore waters of Portugal and to the south and west of Ireland (surveyed by the Irish ObSERVE project), and included coastal waters of Norway north to Vestfjorden. In total, 27,700 (CV = 0.23) Common Bottlenose Dolphins were estimated (Hammond <em>et al.</em> 2017). As part of the ObSERVE aerial surveys of the Irish EEZ, 8,700 km of line transect aerial surveys were conducted in Beaufort sea state ≤4 in both the summer (May-June 2016) and winter (November-February) of 2016/2017. There were clear seasonal differences in habitat use and abundance of Common Bottlenose Dolphins, which showed an approximate 2.5 fold increase in density during winter (0.626 individuals/km<sup>2</sup>) compared to summer (0.257 individuals/km<sup>2</sup>). The summer abundance estimate was 87,330 (CV = 0.21) (Rogan <em>et al.</em> 2017). In Scottish waters, abundance was estimated as 195 (95% highest posterior density intervals (HPDI): 162–253) from the Moray Firth to Fife and 45 (95% HPDI: 33–66) in the Hebrides, leading to the conclusion that 200-300 Common Bottlenose Dolphins inhabit the inshore coastal waters of Scotland (Cheney <em>et al</em>. 2013). A community of 420 dolphins (95% confidence interval (CI) = 331–521) was documented in the Normano-Breton Gulf of the English Channel (Louis <em>et al</em>. 2015). Photo-identification surveys of Common Bottlenose Dolphins in the Shannon Estuary of western Ireland in 2010 resulted in an abundance estimate of 107 (CV = 0.12; 95% CI = 83 to 131)) (Berrow <em>et al</em>. 2012).</p>  <p>Total abundance for the Mediterranean Sea Common Bottlenose Dolphin subpopulation, listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List, is unknown but thought to be in the low 10,000’s and decreasing (Bearzi <em>et al.</em> 2008, Bearzi and Fortuna 2006). Surveys of 86,000 km<sup>2</sup> of the northwestern Mediterranean off Spain in 2002 estimated 7,654 (CV = 0.45) Common Bottlenose Dolphins (Forcada <em>et al</em>. 2004). Based on surveys in 2000-2003 an estimated 584 (CV = 0.28) individuals occur in the Alboran Sea of Spain (Cañadas and Hammond 2006). Abundance estimates for other parts of the Mediterranean Sea include 148 (95% CI = 132 to 180) in the Amvrakikos Gulf, western Greece (Bearzi <em>et al</em>. 2008), 1,676 (95% CI = 804-3,492) in the Pelagos Sanctuary of the western Mediterranean (Lauriano <em>et al</em>. 2014), 517 (95% CI = 406-658) in the Balearic Islands (Gonzalvo <em>et al</em>. 2014), and 42 (95% CI = 42.0 to 43.1)<strong> </strong>off northeastern Tunisia (Benmessaoud <em>et al.</em> 2013). A decline in the resident Common Bottlenose Dolphin population inhabiting the Kvarnerić area of the northern Adriatic Sea, Croatia during 1995-2003 appears to have been reversed, with about 200 individuals currently using the area (Pleslić <em>et al.</em> 2013). Bottlenose dolphins near Lampedusa Island, Italy, have increased significantly since 1998 to 249 (95% CI = 162 to 449) (Pulcini <em>et al</em>. 2014). Mediterranean Bottlenose Dolphins exhibit subpopulation structure, based on behavior, toxicology, diet, and genetics (Borrell <em>et al</em>. 2005, Natoli <em>et al</em>. 2005, Bearzi <em>et al</em>. 2008).</p>  <p>The total population size of the Black Sea Bottlenose Dolphin subspecies, currently listed as Endangered, is unknown. However, there are abundance estimates for parts of the range suggesting that population size is at least several thousand individuals (Birkun 2006, 2012).</p>  <p>Off South America, 83 (95% CI = 73 to 112) Common Bottlenose Dolphins were estimated in Bahía San Antonio, Argentina in 2006-2008 (Vermuelen and Cammareri 2009). Further to the south in Patagonia, in Golfo San José and adjacent areas, Common Bottlenose Dolphin abundance has declined since the 1970s from at least 53 to 34 dolphins (CV = 0.20) and range shifts have been observed; the causes of these changes could not be conclusively determined (Coscarella <em>et al</em>. 2012). Investigations into possible short-term declines in Common Bottlenose Dolphin abundance due to bycatch in Patos Lagoon, Brazil, found the population to be stable over the period 1998-2012, with an estimate in 2012 of 78 animals (95% CI = 70-86) (Fruet <em>et al</em>. 2011, 2015). &#160;</p>  <p>Off New Zealand, the Fiordland Bottlenose Dolphin subpopulation is listed as Critically Endangered, with only 205 (95% CI: 192-219) individuals in 2008, of which 123 were mature (Currey <em>et al. </em>2009). Elsewhere in New Zealand, there are an estimated 211 Common Bottlenose Dolphins (95% CI = 195 to 232) in the Marlborough Sounds (Merriman <em>et al</em>. 2009) and 92 (95% CI = 80 to 111) near Stewart Island (Brough <em>et al</em>. 2015). Common Bottlenose Dolphins in the Bay of Islands, New Zealand showed a 7.5% annual rate of decline from 1997-1999 to 2003-2006 (Tezanos-Pinto <em>et al</em>. 2013). </p>  <p>Around the island of São Tomé, off the west coast of Africa, Common Bottlenose Dolphins were the most commonly sighted cetaceans during a total of 226 surveys between 2002 and 2006, and in 2012. In total, 140 individuals were photo-identified, and the high rate of discovery of new individuals suggested that these were part of a much larger population (Pereira <em>et al</em>. 2013). In 2011-2013, during 13,694 km of visual survey transects in continental shelf and slope waters off Northwest Africa, between Tangier and Conakry<em>, T. truncatus</em> were (after the Common Dolphin <em>Delphinus delphis</em>) the second-most frequently encountered cetaceans, accounting for 9.6% of total sightings (Djiba <em>et al.</em> 2015). In offshore waters of the Western Indian Ocean, Bottlenose Dolphins, the majority of which appeared to be <em>T. truncatus</em>, were among the most common cetaceans observed (Ballance and Pitman 1998).</p><p></p>",Unknown,"Common Bottlenose Dolphins occur worldwide through tropical and temperate inshore, coastal, shelf, and oceanic waters (Leatherwood and Reeves 1990, Wells and Scott 1999, Reynolds <em>et al</em>. 2000). They range poleward of 45° in northern Europe (as far as the Faroe Islands 62°N 7°W; Bloch and Mikkelsen 2000) and southern New Zealand (Brough <em>et al</em>. 2015), and the species was recently reported as far south as 53-55<sup>o</sup>S in South America (Olavarría <em>et al</em>. 2010, Goodall <em>et al</em>. 2011). In the eastern Pacific they have been seen as far north as British Columbia (50<sup>o</sup>N) but their typical range is up to 41<sup>o</sup>N (Halpin <em>et al</em>. 2018). Common Bottlenose Dolphins are rare in the Baltic Sea (best considered extralimital there) and are vagrant to Newfoundland and Norway (Wells and Scott 1999). They occur regularly in the Red Sea (Notarbartolo di Sciara <em>et al</em>. 2018) and the Arabian Sea (Baldwin <em>et al.</em> 1999).","<p>Common Bottlenose Dolphins are hunted in some areas (St. Vincent, Sri Lanka, Japan, Indonesia, West Africa) for human consumption, and as bait in fisheries. In addition, Common Bottlenose Dolphins are sometimes removed from the wild and maintained under human care for public display, research, and training to support specific military and civilian functions at sea. They are increasingly the objects of dolphin watching (tourism) activities.</p>",Marine,"<p>The Common Bottlenose Dolphin is listed in Appendix II of CITES.

Commercial hunting of Black Sea cetaceans including Bottlenose Dolphins was banned in 1966 in the former USSR, Bulgaria and Romania, and in 1983 in Turkey.

It is a highly desirable&#160;species, with a long history of exploitation. This exploitation resulted in significant decreases in stock size off Canada and the United States. Management measures undertaken in response to these declines led to improved stock status. Off the U.S. west coast, this species is not overfished and overfishing is not occurring. The substantial reduction in the allowable catch beginning in 1997, such that no directed fishery was conducted, showed signs of improving the stock status by the mid-2000s. Recent stock assessments are not available for the subpopulation in Canadian waters.&#160;At present, the stocks are thought to be in recovery from record low levels of abundance. Therefore, this species is listed as Least Concern.&#160;Further monitoring of the population size and harvest levels of this species is needed to ensure that current management measures result in a sustainable population. Additionally, monitoring of recruitment success is also advised, since interannual variation in recruitment has been observed.","This demersal species inhabits soft substrates of the continental shelf and slope (Hart 1973, Kravitz and Pearcy 1976, Mecklenburg <em>et al</em>. 2002, Love <em>et al</em>. 2005, Haltuch <em>et al.</em> 2013). Individuals have been taken at depths from shallow-water to 550 m, but some seasonal and ontogenetic differences in depth of occurrence have been documented. Off British Columbia, Canada, adults undergo seasonal movements to deeper waters (310-460 m) in winter and shallower depths (73-128 m) during the rest of the year. Juveniles (age 1 and 2 years) have been collected at 18-71 m, but this is not necessarily the regular habitat (Hart 1973). Duffy-Anderson&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;(2015) indicated that the inner shelf serves as a nursery for juveniles based on Pearcy <em>et al</em>. (1977).<br/><br/>Spawning occurs at deep-water localities (270-460 m), with the timing dependent upon locality. For example, off the U.S. west coast, spawning occurs from winter to early spring (November to April), with a peak from December to February (Wetzel 2019), whereas, off British Columbia, Canada, spawning occurs from from late winter to early spring (Hart 1973). Females spawn once a year and fecundity increases with fish size, and can range to as many as 1.5 million eggs (Porter 1964, Wetzel 2019).&#160;<br/><br/>The diet consists of benthic crustaceans and fishes (Kravitz and Pearcy 1976, Link&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2015). Off British Columbia, Canada, the most important food items include euphasids, sand lance, herring, and shrimps (Hart 1973). <br/><br/>Size and age at maturity varies with latitude. Off British Columbia, males reach 50% maturity at around 38 cm and age 7 and females around 44 cm and age 8 (Hart 1973). In contrast, off central Oregon, females were 50% mature at 33 cm and age 5 (Hannah <em>et al</em>. 2002).&#160;Females attain larger sizes than those of males&#160; (Best 1963, Pedersen 1975). The maximum length reported is 70 cm (Eschmeyer and Herald 1983, Mecklenburg&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2002, Love&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2005).<br/><br/>Maximum longevity has been reported at 31 years for fish taken off California (Haltuch&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2013), and possibly to 34 years (Wetzel 2019), whereas Hart (1973) reported longevities of 25 for females and 19 for males taken off Canada. When applying the equation recommended by the IUCN Red List methods: 1/adult mortality + age of first reproduction, the generation length is estimated to be about 12 years.","This species is commercially exploited throughout its range. Historically, overexploitation has led to documented declines in the population size (e.g., Wetzel 2019). Much of the landings result from exploitation of spawning aggregations during winter months (see summary in Wetzel 2019). The exploitation of pre-spawning or spawning individuals may have a more negative impact than would harvesting during other seasons. However, current levels of exploitation are relatively low compared to historical levels and some rebuilding of the stocks has occurred (Wetzel 2019).&#160;<em></em>","Limited information is available regarding the population structure of this species. At least two stocks were thought to exist off Vancouver Island previously (Pedersen 1975) but the most recent stock assessment (Starr 2009) includes a single stock. Off the U.S. west coast, previous assessments included two separate stocks (e.g., Lai <em>et al</em>. 2005); however, more recent molecular analyses and tagging studies suggested that only a single, coast-wide stock occurs in these waters, and thus only one stock is assessed (Wetzel 2019).<br/><br/><strong>Canada</strong>: Off British Columbia, substantial declines in annual catches were noted as early as 1948 (Alverson and Chatwin 1957), and the stocks remained at apparently low abundance through the mid-1990s (Starr 2009). A total allowable catch was set at 479 tonnes (t) in 1997, and increased to 600 t in 2004; as a result, no directed fishing for this species is permitted and trawl fishers are limited to incidental harvests only. The proportion of small sized individuals entering the fishery had increased over the period of 1998-2002 (Starr and Fargo 2004). Starr and Fargo (2004) found that the population has been increasing in abundance in recent years and current stock status seems to be at or above the level of maximum yield, and noted an increase in bycatch rates of this species had been recorded by fishermen.&#160;Similarly, Starr (2009) determined that the population continued to increase through 2007. More recent stock assessments have been not been published.&#160;&#160;<br/><br/><strong>United States</strong>: Wetzel (2019) provided a succinct summary of the historic and current population trajectory - Petrale Soles were lightly exploited during the early 1900s, but by the 1950s, the fishery was well developed with the stock showing declines in biomass and catches (Wetzel 2019). The rate of decline in spawning biomass accelerated through the 1970s reaching minimums generally around or below 10% of the unexploited levels during the 1980s through the early 2000s. The spawning stock biomass is estimated to have increased in recent years due to reduced catches during rebuilding and in response to above average recruitment in 2006, 2007, and 2008. Currently, the relative spawning biomass is estimated to be at approximately 39% of unfished spawning biomass, which is above the target of 25%. According to the most recent analyses, the stock is not overfished nor is overfishing occurring (Wetzel&#160;2019).",Stable,"<em></em>This species is distributed in the eastern Pacific Ocean from the Gulf of Alaska to Coronado Islands, Baja California, Mexico (Hart 1973, Mecklenburg <em>et al</em>. 2002, Haltuch <em>et al. </em>2013, Pietsch and Orr 2015). The presence of this species in the eastern Aleutian Islands and Bering Sea is based on a single historical record according to Mecklenburg <em>et al</em>.

It is common and abundant throughout its range. It is not directly targeted, but is taken in mixed-species flatfish fisheries, where among the species of <em>Citharichthys</em>, it constitutes 90% of the landings.&#160;Based on the assessment of the U.S. stock (Washington, Oregon, and California), the spawning stock biomass and recruitment have more than doubled since the mid-2000s; the stock is considered healthy and not overfished. Limited information is available regarding landings, discards, or population size in Canada, Alaska, and Mexico. Given the wide distribution, local abundance, and healthy status of the U.S. stock off Washington, Oregon, and California, this species is listed as Least Concern. Further research and monitoring on specific-specific population and harvest trends is recommended, particularly in areas where such monitoring is not presently occurring.","This marine species is mainly benthic over a variety of substrata, including gravel, sand, shelly and silty bottoms, but it can also be found in the water column (Allen and Leos 2001, He <em>et al.</em> 2013, Kells <em>et al</em>. 2016). Juveniles are typically found at shallower depths, occasionally entering intertidal or brackish water (Mecklenburg <em>et al</em>. 2002). Adults are not highly migratory, but movements are influenced by prey availability, seasonal temperature changes, and substrate (Rackowski and Pikitch 1989 and references therein).<br/><br/>Diets of adult Pacific Sanddabs (85-211 mm standard length) are varied, including euphausid and mysid crustaceans, polychaetes, razor clams, and fishes. Based on these prey items, this species is likely an opportunistic feeder with limited digging ability (Hulberg and Oliver 1978, Rackowski and Pikitch 1989). Pacific Sanddabs are, in turn, preyed upon by numerous fishes, seabirds, and marine mammals (He <em>et al</em>. 2013).&#160;<br/><br/>Mature individuals may congregate for spawning as has been documented for Speckled Sanddabs (Ford 1965). Spawning typically takes place from July-September, with a peak in August (Arora 1951, Rackowski and Pikitch 1989), though it may last through January in some areas (e.g., in Monterey Bay: He <em>et al</em>. 2013) or even until February in Puget Sound (Hart 1973).<br/><br/>Historically, females attained sexual maturity at about 3 years old, at approximately 19 cm total length (Arora 1951); more recently, female maturation is estimated to occur at smaller sizes (~ 13 cm) than those estimated previously for females collected in the same area (He <em>et al</em>. 2013, Lefebvre <em>et al</em>. 2016). Batch fecundity is estimated to range from 810-17,400 (mean = 6,350) eggs released per spawn, with a linear increase in batch fecundity with length (He&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2013, Lefebvre&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2016). Spawning occurs more than once per season (Hart 1973, Matarese<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;1989, Donohoe 2000, Allen and Leos 2001), with some females spawning daily.<br/><br/>Females live longer, grow faster, and attain larger sizes than males (Rackowski and Pikitch 1989, He <em>et al.</em> 2013). Maximum longevity has been reported at 12-13 years (He <em>et al</em>. 2013). The maximum reported size is 40.6 cm (Arora 1951, Chamberlain 1979, Rackowski and Pikitch 1989).<br/><br/>In a recent stock assessment, natural mortality was estimated to be 0.32 for females and 0.37 for males (He <em>et al</em>. 2013). Applying the equation: 1/adult mortality + age of first reproduction, where the mortality is 0.32 and age at first reproduction is 2 years,&#160;the generation length is estimated to be 5.1 years.","<span id=""docs-internal-guid-1513c950-7fff-b60a-87d7-1f3647f0572f"">No major threats to this species are known.&#160;As a rapidly growing and early maturing species, Pacific Sanddab is considered to have low vulnerability to overfishing (He&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2013). Small juveniles occur in inshore waters and would be subject to anthropogenic activities occurring in these areas.","<p>This species is common and abundant, and commercial landings indicate populations are in good condition (Allen and Leos 2001) and all biomass models indicate a healthy stock status (He <em>et al. </em>2013). The entire population is considered to be a single stock that was stable until the mid-1990s, declined continuously to the mid-2000s, but then increased at least to 2012 (He&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2013). Presently, the stock is considered not overfished and not approaching an overfished condition; however, whether or not overfishing is occurring is unknown (NOAA 2020, Summary of Stock Status for FSSI Stocks).</p>  <p><span style="""">Estimated annual commercial landings for this species in U.S. waters include single species landings and aggregated landings (combining catches of four sanddab species), of which this species is estimated to contribute more than 90% of total aggregated landings (Pearson&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2008). Total landings from all four U.S. fishery sectors (California and Oregon/Washington commercial trawl, recreational, and mink fisheries) have fluctuated throughout the available time series (1969-2012), with peak landings in the late 1990s and early 2000s (Pearson&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2008, He&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2013). Over the most recent 15-year time series (1998-2012), thought to represent a period of three generation lengths for this species, landings have declined from just under 800 metric tons in 1998 to just over 220 metric tons in 2012 (He&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2013).&#160;Total catch, which includes landings and estimated discards&#160;for this species between 2004-2012, have remained less than half of the Allowable Catch Limit (He&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>201</span>3).</p><p>Estimated spawning stock biomass (SSB) decreased between 1995-2008, but SSB has increased in the most recent years for which data are available (2009-2013), where estimates mirrored the high values from the mid-1990s (&gt; 8,500 metric tons: He <em>et al. </em>2013).</p>",Increasing,"This species is widely distributed in the eastern North Pacific where it occurs from the western Gulf of Alaska to Cabo San Lucas, Baja California Sur, Mexico (Miller and Lea 1972, Hart 1973, Arora 1951, Rackowski and Pikitch 1989, Mecklenburg <em>et al</em>. 2002, He <em>et al.</em> 2013, Robertson and Allen 2015). Mecklenburg <em>et al</em>. (2002) stated that records from teh eastern Bering Sea are uncertain. Similarly, Stevenson and Hoff (2009) reported low confidence in the identification of specimens purportedly of this species during the annual surveys of the eastern Bering Sea continental shelf conducted by the Alaska Fisheries Science Center from 1982-2009. It occurs at depths between 10-549 m, but is rarely found deeper than 183 m (Allen and Leos 2001, Mecklenburg <em>et al</em>. 2002).","This species is taken by commercial and recreational fisheries (He <em>et al</em>. 2013). Despite never being a primary target of commercial fisheries, the Pacific Sanddab is highly prized in U.S. markets and commonly taken by bottom trawlers (He <em>et al.</em> 2013). It is relatively more important in California, where it is regarded as a delicacy, than in Canada (Hart 1973).<br/><br/>In the U.S., especially in central and northern California waters, Pacific Sanddab&#160;is the most abundant sanddab species (Allen and Leos 2001). A complex of four species of sanddabs is managed as part of the flatfish complex and is included in the Federal Groundfish Management Pla<span style="""">n (He&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2013</span>).&#160;It is considered as a single stock that is taken in four main fishery sectors: 1) commercial trawl fisheries of California, 2) commercial trawl fisheries of Oregon/Washington, 3) recreational fisheries mainly using hook and line, and 4) a trawl fishery in which they are taken to be used for mink food (He <em>et al. </em>2013).&#160;<br/><br/>Most landings (of mixed catches of species of <em>Citharichthys</em>, of which <em>C. sordidus</em> represents approximately 90% of the catches) are recorded in the U.S., especially in Washington, Oregon and California. The earliest reported commercial catch dates from 1892; peak landings of approximately 900 mt were recorded in the late 1910s. Landings were relatively low at about 400 mt from 1930-1970, increased from 1970 to the late 1990s and early 2000s, and then declined to about 200 mt in 2013 (Rackowski and Pikitch 1989, He <em>et al</em>. 2013). Recreational fisheries averaged 7% of total U.S. landings of this species between 1981-2012, but these recreational landings increased to 30% between 2010-2012, ranging between 20-80 mt per year (He&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2013). In Canada, most catches are discarded, but a small, steady demand for this species exists in British Columbia (Hart 1973). Historical landings from Canadian fisheries are not considered reliable (Hart 1973), but more recent estimates of&#160;annual catches range from 4.3 mt-101.1 mt between 1996 and 2012. In Mexico, no published information is available on fisheries for Pacific Sanddab, but there is some evidence of recreational fishers catching this species (He&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2013).",Marine,"The landings of Pacific Sanddab are controlled by a variety of federal and state management measures, including gear restrictions, size and bag limits, area and seasonal closures, and discard regulations (see detailed discussion of fisheries management activities in He <em>et al</em>. 2013).

It primarily consumes Walleye Pollock, shrimp and euphausiids (Yang and Livingston 1986, Orlov and Mukhametov 2003). The maximum total length is approximately 110 cm (Mecklenburg <em>et al</em>. 2002, Kells<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2016). The largest individuals occur in the deeper slope areas, while smaller individuals occur in shelf areas (Laman <em>et al</em>. 2018).

When applying the equation recommended by the IUCN Red List methods: 1/adult mortality + age of first reproduction, the generation length is estimated to be about 19 years.",Fishing activity is not expected to be driving population declines approaching levels at which the species would qualify even for Near Threatened status at this time.,"<strong>Russia:</strong>&#160;In Russian waters, this species is abundant off Pacific Kamchatka and the Kuril Islands, also the Olyutorsky-Navarin region in the northwestern Bering Sea, but it is rare in the Sea of Japan (Datsky&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014,&#160;Orlov and Tokranov 2019). Biomass of this species off the northern Kuril Islands and southeastern Kamchatka increased significantly from 1989 to 2009 and then exhibited a slight decline from 2009 to 2018&#160;(Savin <em>et al.</em> 2019). Based on trawl surveys conducted from 1996-2012, abundance increased in the Olyutorsky-Navarin region since 2004 (Datsky <em>et al.</em> 2014). In fisheries catches, Kamchatka Flounder (<em>Atheresthes evermanni</em>)&#160;is lumped with three other species that are categorized by fishers as 'halibut', including Arrowtooth Flounder (<em>Atheresthes stomias</em>), Pacific Halibut (<em>Hippoglossus stenolepis</em>) and Greenland Halibut (<em>Reinhardtius hippoglossoides</em>).<em>&#160;</em>The Pacific Halibut and Greenland Halibut constitute the majority of the halibut catches with Kamchatka Flounder and Arrowtooth Flounder contributing only a very small quantity to these catches. Total annual halibut catches were stable around an average of 15,000 tons per year for the period 2008-2019 with a decreasing trend since 2016. Catch per unit effort of halibuts has declined since 2012. According to Russian scientific trawl surveys conducted over the past 42 years (since the late 1970s), the catch per unit effort of this species has been stable with no noticeable trend over time (I. Volvenko pers. comm. 2020).<br/><br/><strong>Japan:</strong> This species is common from off Hokkaido to the continental slope off the Tohoku region, Pacific coast of Honshu, Japan (Yamamura 2003, Hattori&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2010). It is taken in commercial fisheries there, but no formal stock assessment is conducted (Hattori&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2010).<br/><br/><strong>United States: </strong>In U.S. waters, this species is most abundant in the Aleutian Islands, where abundance decrease from east to west. It is also present and relatively common in Bering Sea slope waters to Chirikof Island (Zimmermann and Goddard 1996, Bryan&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018, D. Stevenson pers. comm. 2020).<strong>&#160;</strong>According to the most recent full assessment of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands stock, this species is not overfished, and overfishing is not occurring (Bryan <em>et al.</em> 2018). The 2019&#160;interim update also concluded that this species is not overfished nor approaching an overfished condition, and that overfishing is not occurring&#160;(Bryan&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2019). Prior to 2011, catches of Kamchatka Flounder were combined with those of Arrowtooth Flounder (<em>Atheresthes stomias</em>), and prior to 2010, the fishery was managed as a complex.&#160;Kamchatka Flounder constituted 10% of the catch from 1991-2007, and its contribution increased to 31% in 2008, 45% in 2009 and 55% in 2010, which is the same year when a directed fishery for Kamchatka Flounder (separate from Arrowtooth Flounder) began. From the 1960s to 1991, catches were not consistently reported as separate species, and earlier years included the Kamchatka and Arrowtooth flounders as well as the Greenland Turbot (<em>Reinhardtius hippoglossoides</em>). Effort in this fishery increased during the 1970s, and then declined upon implementation of the Magnuson–Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act in 1976 when catch restrictions and the exclusion of foreign fishing fleets from U.S. waters began. From 1977-2008 catches of Kamchatka and Arrowtooth flounders remained around 12,000 to 13,000 tons, with Kamchatka Flounder representing less than 10% of the catch. Catches of Kamchatka Flounder peaked in 2010 and have declined thereafter. Three scientific surveys quantified Kamchatka Flounder biomass off Alaska over the past few decades: 1) the eastern Bering Sea slope survey recorded declining biomass between 2012 and 2016 (this area has not been surveyed since 2016); 2) the shelf survey documented a stable biomass trend over the entire time period (since 1991); and 3) the Aleutian Islands survey recorded a small increase in biomass from 2016 to 2018. According to fishery independent scientific surveys and stock assessment models generated for data from 1991-2018, or over about the past 30 years (about one and a half generations), biomass of this species in the eastern Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands&#160;has not fluctuated widely over time, and has been increasing&#160;since 2013-2014. A 15% decline that occurred from 2009-2013 is attributed to increased fishing mortality, but this did not result in overfishing. Biomass in the most recent year of available data, 2018, was 148,847 t, which is 97% of the 153,965 t peak&#160;in 2009. The recent increasing trend in biomass is attributed to strong recruitment cohorts&#160;(Bryan&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018,&#160;2019).",Increasing,"This species is distributed from central Japan, across the North Pacific Ocean to the Aleutian Islands, Alaska, with strays occurring in the Gulf of Alaska, off British Columbia and to as far south as Davenport, Santa Cruz County, California (Mecklenburg <em>et al</em>. 2002, Lea 2013, Nakabo 2013, Tokhairin&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2015, Parin&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014, Kells<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2016).

On the Pacific coast, this species ranges from off Honshu (from Aomori to Ibaraki) to off Hokkaido, Japan. Off Russia, it occurs from the Commander Islands to the Bering Sea, including the southern Gulf of Anadyr, and the Aleutian Islands. The depth range is 1-1,320 metres (I. Volvenko pers. comm. 2020).","This species is captured by commercial trawl fisheries in Russian waters, but&#160;is a low-value species taken as bycatch in fisheries that target <em>Reinhardtius hippoglossoides</em> and <em>Hippoglossus stenolepis</em>&#160;(Tokranov <em>et al</em>. 2005, Datsky <em>et al.</em> 2014, Parin&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014). It is targeted by commercial fisheries operating in U.S. waters in the eastern Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands, with catches sold to both domestic and foreign markets (Bryan <em>et al</em>. 2018).

It is commercially exploited throughout much of its range and is also taken as bycatch. The estimated total biomass in the Gulf of Alaska has declined by 32% since 2006, or over one past generation length, but it is not categorized as overfished and overfishing is not occurring. The cause of this decline is not well understood. The Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands stock is also not overfished, and biomass of this stock has been mostly increasing over the past three generation lengths and is not expected to decline in the future. Spawning biomass in the U.S. West Coast stock has increased over the past three generation lengths. Comprehensive fisheries management has been in place in U.S. waters since 1976, and conservation measures related to this are expected to remain in place. Fisheries management and monitoring are also in place in Canadian waters, but uncertainty associated with current stock assessment models is high. Estimates of female spawning biomass and recruitment since 1996, however, do not report any significant declines, and appear to be either stable or increasing. According to Russian scientific trawl surveys conducted over the past 42 years (since the late 1970s), the catch per unit effort of this species was stable with no noticeable trend over time. Fishing activity is not expected to be driving population declines approaching levels at which the species would qualify even for Near Threatened status at this time. No major threats are known and conservation measures are expected to remain in place; therefore, it is listed as Least Concern.&#160;Research on the genetic structure of populations across its range is highly recommended. In addition, investigation on the cause of the recent decline of this species in the Gulf of Alaska is needed.&#160;<br/><br/>The findings and conclusions in this document are those of the authors, and do not necessarily represent the views of the National Marine Fisheries Service.","This demersal species occurs on soft bottoms on the continental shelf and continental slope (Mecklenburg <em>et al</em>. 2002). Large individuals inhabit deeper parts of the depth range, and water temperature, which can fluctuate year to year, dictates depth preference (Doyle<em> et al</em>. 2018). This batch spawner moves to depths deeper than 400 m along the continental shelf break in winter to spawn (Blood <em>et al. </em>2007). Females reach a maximum total length of 100 cm and males 54 cm (Spies&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2019). <br/><br/>Natural mortality of this species in the Gulf of Alaska is estimated at 0.2 for females and 0.35 for males (Spies <em>et al.</em> 2019). Age and length at first maturity are 7.6 years and 48 cm (Stark 2011). Longevity is 23 years for females and 20 years for males, but individuals have been aged to 36 years&#160;(Spies <em>et al. </em>2019). When applying the equation recommended by the IUCN Red List methods: 1/adult mortality + age of first reproduction, the generation length is calculated to be about 13 years.","This species is targeted by commercial trawl fisheries, is retained as bycatch in a hook-and-line fishery for Pacific halibut, and also is taken in the bycatch of demersal trawl fisheries. Fishing activity is not expected to be driving population declines approaching levels at which the species would qualify even for Near Threatened status at this time. Nor is it expected that fishing activities will be driving declines approaching a Near Threatened status in the near future.","Connectivity between subpopulations of this species is poorly understood (Spies<em>&#160;et al</em>. 2019), but some studies have concluded that there is likely some flow of propagules from the eastern (U.S.) to the western side (Russia) of the Bering Sea (Orlov 2004). On a global level, the largest abundance of this species is in the eastern Pacific, or in Alaskan waters (Orlov 2004).<strong><br/><br/>Russia: </strong>This species is naturally rare in Russian waters, including off the Kuril Islands and Kamchatka (Orlov and Tokranov 2007,&#160;Parin<em>&#160;et al</em>. 2014). Before 1994, it was only rarely captured in the northern Kurils and off southeastern Kamchatka, but a noted increase in catch occurred after 1997. This increase was likely driven by spillover from the biomass increase that began in the Aleutian Islands in the 1960s and continued throughout the 1990s (Orlov 2004).&#160;In fisheries catches, Arrowtooth Flounder (<em>Atheresthes stomias</em>)&#160;is lumped with three other species that are categorized by fishers as 'halibut', including Kamchatka Flounder (<em>Atheresthes evermanni</em>), Pacific Halibut (<em>Hippoglossus stenolepis</em>), and Greenland Halibut (<em>Reinhardtius hippoglossoides</em>).<em>&#160;</em>The Pacific Halibut and Greenland Halibut constitute the majority of the halibut catches with Kamchatka Flounder and Arrowtooth Flounder contributing only a very small quantity to these landings. Total annual halibut catches were stable around an average of 15,000 tons per year for the period 2008-2019 with a decreasing trend observed since 2016. The proportion of halibut catches landed in all Russian fisheries combined has declined from 0.4 to 0.7% over time. Catch per unit effort of halibuts has declined since 2012. According to Russian scientific trawl surveys conducted over the past 42 years (since the late 1970s), the catch per unit effort of this species was stable with no noticeable trend over time (I. Volvenko pers. comm. 2020).<br/><br/><strong>United States:&#160;</strong>This species is more abundant in the Gulf of Alaska than it is in the Bering Sea. It experienced a significant increase in biomass from the 1960s to mid-2010s and was the most abundant groundfish in the Gulf of Alaska during 2000-2010. Biomass has declined since 2010, but the species remains common in the Gulf (Barnes <em>et al.</em> 2018, Spies&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2019). Abundance is highest in the central and western parts of the Gulf as compared to west Yakutat and east Yakutat/Southeast, with the highest fishing effort occurring in the central part of the Gulf. Prior to 1990, all flatfish species were combined in catch statistics in Gulf of Alaska fisheries. The bottom trawl fishery, which is the primary fishery sector that lands Arrowtooth Flounder, primarily targets Rock Soles (<em>Lepidopsetta </em>spp.), Rex Sole (<em>Glyptocephalus zachirus</em>) and Dover Sole (<em>Microstomus pacificus</em>). Arrowtooth Flounder is a lower-value flatfish species, but is directly targeted, and retention of this species in flatfish catches increased from less than 10% in the early 1990s to over 70% in 2010-2013 and 90% or more since 2013 in part due to improvements in product processing that allowed for a better quality meat. Estimated total biomass in the Gulf of Alaska stock for the time period from 1977 to 1984 was stable around 1,250,000 t before increasing to an overall peak by 2006 of 1,966,630 t, but then biomass declined thereafter by 32% to 1,333,540 t in 2019, which represents the past 14 years or about one generation. According to trawl survey data, estimated biomass in the central part of the Gulf alone declined since 2003 by 62% from 2,819,095 t to 1,076,727 t in 2019. The most recent assessment of the Gulf of Alaska stock&#160;concluded that overfishing is not occurring, and it is not overfished nor approaching an overfished condition.&#160;Catches have not exceeded catch limits for the entire period during which limits have been implemented (since 1991), but fishing mortality increased concurrent with decreasing biomass and recruitment has declined since peaking in 2000 (Spies&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2019). The cause of the current decline (since 2006) is uncertain but is not thought to be driven by changes in environmental conditions. The larvae of this species consume a specific type of copepod and further investigation is needed on abundance trends of this prey item to determine if this has any impact on the subpopulations of Arrowtooth Flounder&#160;(I. Spies pers. comm. 2020).<span style=""""><br/></span><br/>According to the most recent assessment of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands stock, overfishing is not occurring and this stock is not overfished nor approaching an overfished condition. Biomass models for this stock are available for the 44-year period from 1976 to the current day. A continuous and significant increase in biomass was observed with landings of 239,708 t&#160;in 1982 to a peak of 943,717 t in 2009. A 14%&#160;decline occurred from 2009 to 2016, but landings have been increasing since then, and the projected 2021 biomass is estimated at 934,008 t, which represents 99% of the 2009&#160;peak (Spies and Palsson 2019).<br/><br/>According to the most recent assessment of the West Coast stock, which includes landings from the states of Oregon, Washington and California, spawning biomass of this species declined rapidly in the 1970s, increased through the 1980s, peaked at 75,630 mt in 1991, then declined to 29,626 mt in 2010, and has been steadily increasing since that time. As of 2017, biomass reached 87% of the unfished level. Over the past three generations, or since about 2005, spawning biomass has increased overall. The exploitation rate is relatively low (Sampson <em>et al</em>. 2017).<br/><br/><strong>Canada: </strong>Until improvements in product preservation occurred, especially the introduction of freezer trawlers, most catch of this species by Canadian fisheries was discarded at sea prior to the mid-2000s, at times in large quantities. Fishing effort and catch has increased since 2010 off British Columbia. According to the most recent stock assessment for British Columbia, there is a large amount of uncertainty associated with the stock status due to the lack of reliable data on catch and discards prior to 1996, and it is not definitively known if the stock is overfished or approaching overfishing. The female spawning biomass trend has either been increasing or stable since 1996 and recruitment has been relatively stable (Grandin and Forrest 2017; see Table 7 page 28). Prior to the Grandin and Forrest (2017) assessment, this stock had not been assessed since Fargo and Starr (2001).",Stable,"This species is distributed in the North Pacific&#160;from Cape Navarin and the Commander Islands of Russia, the eastern Sea of Okhotsk, eastern Kamchatka and the northern Kuril Islands to the northern Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands of Alaska south to San Simeon, California in the United States (Mecklenburg <em>et al</em>. 2002). The depth range is 1-1,146 metres (Parin<em> et al</em>. 2014, Kells<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2016, I. Volvenko pers. comm. 2020), but this species is most abundant between 100-300 m (Spies <em>et al.</em> 2019).","This species is directly targeted by commercial fisheries in U.S. and Canadian waters and is primarily taken in bottom trawls, and it is also retained as bycatch in other flatfish fisheries, including the hook-and-line fishery that targets Pacific Halibut. It is sold to both domestic and foreign markets (Grandin and Forrest 2017, Spies&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2019). According to Hart (1973), catches landed in Canada were used for mink feed.",Marine,"The Alaska Fisheries Science Center conducts annual stock assessments of this species in U.S. waters of the Gulf of Alaska, Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands. The subpopulation is monitored through data collected in both fishery dependent (catch trends) and annual fishery independent scientific surveys conducted throughout this area.

A coastwide stock assessment process is in place for the coast of British Columbia and catch limits are also implemented in Canadian waters&#160;(Grandin and Forrest 2017). <br/><br/>Genetics research is needed throughout this species' range to determine stock boundaries (Spies<em> et al</em>. 2019). Grandin and Forrest (2017) recommend genetic analyses as well as ageing archived otolith samples and developing catch reconstruction methods to reduce uncertainty currently associated with stock assessment models for Canadian waters.

It is an important component of flounder fisheries in Japan and Korea and is retained as bycatch in Russian waters. In Chinese waters, it also likely contributes to the flounder catches, though no specific data are available to monitor changes in abundance. The population structure across this species' range remains poorly understood, but it is considered to have a naturally low abundance in Russian waters, parts of the Sea of Japan, and in the eastern Pacific (from Alaska to California, where relatively few captures have been recorded). Since it is considered common and abundant in Korean waters and off the northern Pacific coast of Japan, the largest proportion of its global population (for the purposes of this Red List assessment) is inferred to occur in these areas.&#160;According to scientific survey data collected since the late 1970s, catch per unit effort (CPUE) of this species in Russian waters has been stable with no noticeable trend. On the Pacific coast of the Tohoku area of Japan, CPUE declined by about 62% over the past three generations (since about 1983) and the stock remains at a low level compared to those observed in the 1970s and early 1980s. A recovery plan is in place and CPUE has been gradually increasing over the past one and half generations (since about 2000). Data are not available for this species in South Korea, but catches of the flounder fisheries that take this species have been in decline since the 1970s, and demand has increased; as such, it is likely that the abundance of this species has declined in South Korean waters. Based on data from the western Pacific, where the majority of its global population occurs, it is suspected that this species has undergone a global-level decline of 30-50% over the past three generations due to overfishing; therefore, it is listed as Vulnerable A2bd.

Most commercial fish stocks, including flatfishes, are heavily overexploited in the Yellow Sea (Xu and Jin 2005). Flatfish stocks in the Bohai Sea have been in decline since the 1960s to at least the 1990s due to overfishing (Shuozeng 1995b). Overfishing, marine pollution, and the destruction of spawning grounds have negatively impacted other pleuronectid species (i.e.&#160;<em>Pleuronichthys </em>spp.) in Chinese waters (Zhu <em>et al</em>. 2012).

In addition, previous confusion with <em>Hippoglossoides elassodon</em> may have confounded survey data for the 1980s and 1990s. It is common and abundant in Russian waters and the flounder stock is in stable condition in the Sea of Okhotsk. It is recommended to increase scientific survey effort in the northern Bering Sea in U.S. waters to investigate shifts in the distribution.<span style=""""> Although some uncertainty is associated with the possible decline in biomass in the eastern Bering Sea, it is listed as Least Concern.&#160;<br/><br/></span>The findings and conclusions in this document are those of the authors, and do not necessarily represent the views of the National Marine Fisheries Service.","This demersal species occurs over soft bottoms from the intertidal zone to the continental slope. It appears to prefer mud as compared to coarser substrates (Mecklenburg <em>et al</em>. 2007). It attains a maximum total length of 52 cm (Mecklenburg <em>et al</em>. 2002, Tuponogov and Kodolov 2012). <br/><br/>According to work by the Alaska Fisheries Science Center, it has been aged to a maximum of 33 years (https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/alaska/commercial-fishing/fish-species-maximum-age-data).&#160;The natural mortality rate is estimated to be 0.2 (McGilliard&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2019).&#160;Age and length at first maturity of this species are 8.7 years and 24 cm in the eastern Bering Sea (Stark 2011, McGilliard&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018).&#160;When applying the equation recommended by the IUCN Red List methods: 1/adult mortality + age of first reproduction, the generation length is estimated to be about 14 years.","Fishing activity is not expected to be driving population declines approaching levels at which the species would qualify even for Near Threatened status at this time. The preference of this species for cold water may cause it to be particularly susceptible to periods of extended warming (Stark 2011), and therefore it may be negatively impacted by climate change and the related increasing water temperatures. Preliminary data suggest that this species may have shifted its distribution northward in response to increasing water temperatures (D. Stevenson pers. comm. 2020).","This species has a similar morphology to the Flathead Sole (<em>Hippoglossoides elassodon</em>) and their distributions overlap in the&#160;northern half of the Bering Sea and the Sea of Okhotsk, but not in the Gulf of Alaska (Turnock<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2017)<em>.</em>&#160;<em>Hippoglossoides elassodon&#160;</em>is more abundant and generally inhabits warmer water than<em>&#160;H. robustus&#160;</em>at least in the eastern Pacific<em>&#160;</em>(McGilliard&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018). Studies are needed to examine the genetic structure throughout its range (Turnock&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017, Vinnikov <em>et al</em>. 2018).&#160;<br/><br/><strong>Russia:</strong>&#160;This species is common and abundant in the Sea of Okhotsk, off western and northeastern Kamchatka, in Aniva Bay, off the northern Kuril Islands and in the Chukchi Sea (Li <em>et al</em>. 2017, Lukyanova <em>et al</em>. 2018, Dyldin <em>et al.</em> 2018, Saveliev <em>et al. </em>2019, Orlov <em>et al</em>. 2020). Its abundance increased on the Chukchi shelf in the Russian EEZ in 2012 (Gavrilov and Glebov 2013). The stock of flounders in the Sea of Okhotsk, where this species is taken in commercial fisheries, is considered stable (Ovchinnikov <em>et al</em>. 2017). According to Russian scientific trawl surveys conducted over the past 42 years (since the late 1970s), the catch per unit effort of this species has been stable with no noticeable trend over time (I. Volvenko pers. comm. 2020).<br/><br/><strong>United States: </strong>This species is abundant in the Chukchi Sea off Alaska<strong>&#160;</strong>(Norcross<em> et al</em>. 2013). Annual stock assessments are conducted for this species in the Gulf of Alaska and Bering Sea/Aleutian Islands. According to the most recent assessment of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands stock, overfishing is not occurring, and this stock is not overfished nor approaching an overfished condition. The exploitation level has been light in recent decades. This species composed only 0.5% of the total commercial catch in 2017 and 2018, and the highest catch proportion was 6% in 1980. It is naturally uncommon in the Aleutian Islands. Fishery-independent scientific surveys have been conducted annually in the eastern Bering Sea since 1983, or over the past 36 years. Survey biomass&#160;peaked in 1991 at 27,630 t and then declined&#160;to a low of 2,092 t in 2019, which represents a 92% decline over the past 29 years (McGilliard&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2018, 2019a). In the southeastern Bering Sea, water temperature was relatively warm from 2001 to 2005 before undergoing a distinct shift to relatively cold from 2006 to 2010. This environmental change corresponded with changes in fish catches in the Bering Sea shelf trawl survey (Stevenson and Lauth 2012). The preference of this species for cold water may cause it to be particularly susceptible to periods of extended warming (Stark 2011). <br/><br/>There are several sources of uncertainty associated with the survey biomass trend. During the 1980s and 1990s, this species could have been easily confused with <em>H. elassodon</em>, and this causes the biomass estimates at the beginning of the decline (1991) and just prior to be uncertain. Availability of this species to the surveys also introduces uncertainty. It is suspected the species is more common in the western Pacific as it is more frequently captured in the U.S. surveys conducted near the Russian EEZ boundary. In addition, it is suspected this species has shifted its distribution northward beyond the current survey extent (D. Stevenson pers. comm. 2020).",Stable,"This species is distributed in the North Pacific and Arctic oceans, from the northern Sea of Japan and Sea of Okhotsk, in the Bering Sea, the Arctic Ocean and south to the Aleutian Islands (Mecklenburg<em> et al</em>. 2002<span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">, Parin&#160;</span><em>et al</em><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">. 2014</span>).

It is highly valued by commercial and recreational fisheries throughout its range and has been exploited since the 1800s. Abundance is higher in the eastern Pacific than in the west. Biomass in Russian waters experienced declines by the early 1970s due to high fishing mortality but increased from the mid-1980s to 2000s as fishing pressure was reduced. Catch per unit effort in scientific surveys conducted since 1976 has been stable over time. In the western Bering Sea and Karaginskaya, biomass fluctuated widely in some years from 1996 to 2017 but these stocks are currently considered stable and exploited at a sustainable level. Biomass in Petropavlovsko-Komandorskaya, however, has declined since 2007 with some stabilization at lower levels in recent years. Fishing is regulated and managed by catch limits, including vessel monitoring.&#160;<br/><br/>Spawning biomass in the U.S. and Canada over the past three generations, or since about 1964, has fluctuated. Since increasing to a peak in 1997, biomass declined by about 70% to 2010 and has been stable at that lower level since then. The primary cause of this most recent decline is a decline in size-at-age of individuals since the 1970s, the cause of which is not clearly understood. Suspected contributing factors include size-selective fishing, increasing abundance of competing predators, changing water temperatures and reduced availability of high-energy prey items. As water temperatures are projected to continue increasing as climate change progresses, there is concern for impacts to this species related to future biomass decline or shifts in distribution. Though high fishing mortality contributed to past declines, fishing effort is now stringently managed and is not likely a driver of decline.&#160;<br/><br/>On the global level, this species is listed as Least Concern with a recommendation to improve the application of total allowable catch limits in the western Pacific and to continue research on declines in size-at-age in the eastern Pacific.&#160;<br/><strong><br/></strong>The findings and conclusions in this document are those of the authors, and do not necessarily represent the views of the National Marine Fisheries Service.","This demersal species occurs on soft and hard bottoms from coastal bays to the continental shelf and slope (Tokranov <em>et al</em>. 2005, Kells<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2016, Hurst 2016). Post-larvae feed on small zooplankton. One- to three-year-old fish feed on small shrimp and other small crustaceans (e.g. crabs), as well as small fishes (IPHC 2014, Lajus <em>et al.</em> 2019). Adults feed on both benthic and pelagic prey, especially cod, sablefish, Walleye Pollock, rockfishes, sculpins, smelt, sand lance, capelin, and flatfishes (including smaller Pacific Halibut), but also relatively high amounts of hermit crabs (IPHC 2014, Webster 2014, Lajus <em>et al.</em> 2019). To a lesser extent, adults also feed on cephalopods, larger crabs, and clams (Hart 1973, Lajus <em>et al</em>. 2019).&#160;<br/><br/>During its life history, this species undergoes ontogenetic and long-term movements, though these movements typically decrease with age and size (IPHC 2014). It conducts annual feeding and spawning migrations (Webster <em>et al</em>. 2013). In the summer, the species typically occurs shallower followed by movement to deep water in the autumn, a secondary movement to an even deeper depth stratum in winter, and a return to shallow water the following spring. Some individuals return to the same feeding grounds in the summer after spawning in winter. Subsequent studies also indicate high rates of interannual homing in conjunction with the potential for basin-scale segregation among spawning groups (Seitz <em>et al. </em>2017).&#160;<br/><br/>Spawning typically occurs between November and March in deeper waters (180-500+) along the continental slope concentrated in submarine canyons (Hart 1973, St. Pierre 1984, IPHC 2014, Drinan <em>et al.</em> 2016). Documented major spawning sites include Cape St. James, Langara Island, and Frederick Island in British Columbia, Yakutat, Cape Suckling – Yakataga, Portlock Bank, and Chirikof Island in Alaska, as well as Middle Canyon near the US/Russia border in the eastern Bering Sea (IPHC 2014, Drinan <em>et al.</em> 2016). It is unclear if individuals return to their natal spawning sites to spawn (Drinan <em>et al</em>. 2016).&#160;<br/><br/>This species batch spawns pelagic eggs that hatch after 15-20 days and the pelagic larval duration is typically 5-6 months, during which time larvae are carried counterclockwise around the northeast Pacific by the Alaskan Stream and/or Alaska Coastal Current (IPHC 2014, Drinan <em>et al.</em> 2016). Settlement of juveniles in shallower nursery areas leads to southerly and easterly (clockwise) migration over an additional 2-3 years and potentially hundreds of miles before reaching the adult stage (IPHC 2014).&#160;<br/><br/>The maximum total length recorded for this species is for a female of 267 cm (Hart 1973). The largest specimen had a live weight of 500 lbs (227 kg). Females grow faster and reach larger sizes than males (Hart 1973, Mecklenburg <em>et al.</em> 2018), but they reach maturity slower than males (IPHC 2014). Males reach maturity at about 72 cm (fork length) and eight years of age, and females mature at about 120 cm and 12 years. Despite substantial size-at-age decreases in recent decades, the average size/age of maturation has not changed in the eastern Pacific (IPHC 2014). The maximum age is approximately 55 years. Recently, female natural mortality is estimated to be 0.15-0.22, although some uncertainty is associated with this estimate (Stewart and Hicks 2020). However, earlier studies (Thompson and Herrington 1930, Myhre 1967) report substantially higher natural mortality rates (around 0.30). When applying the equation recommended by the IUCN Red List methods: 1/adult mortality + age of first reproduction, the generation length is estimated to be about 19 years.","Changes in the biomass of this species are largely driven by changes in size-at-age and variability in recruitment. The recent biomass decline in the eastern Pacific is primarily driven by declines in size-at‐age, and despite several studies, the cause of this is still not fully understood. Projections suggest that further decline is a result of poor recruitment.&#160;Size-selective fishing, which occurs when fishers preferentially capture or retain large individuals, may have contributed to the decline (Sullivan 2016).&#160;A recent modelling study reported the changes in size-at-age could be driven by changes in growth potential related to reduced foraging rates and availability of high-energy prey items, such as Walleye Pollock, which is related to anomalous warm conditions observed in Alaskan waters (Holsman<em>&#160;et al.&#160;</em>2019). For example, according to an examination of the isotopic signatures of Pacific Halibut otoliths, oceanic conditions differed between the Bering Sea and the Gulf of Alaska during the early 1990s (Gao and Beamish 2003). Declines in size-at-age may persist given that water temperatures are projected to increase according to climate change forecasts and that the abundance&#160;of&#160;predators/competitors may continue increasing in the Gulf of Alaska (Holsman<em> et al. </em>2019). A large increase of Arrowtooth Flounder (<em>Atheresthes stomias</em>)&#160;biomass in the Gulf of Alaska that occurred from the 1960s to mid-2010s has been explored as a source of prey competition. A recent study concluded that dietary overlap between these two flatfish species is low, but the potential impact from competitive interactions requires further investigation&#160;(Barnes <em>et al</em>. 2018). Further research is needed on the implications of high trophic-level prey species availability in the eastern North Pacific for the growth of the largest size-at-age Pacific Halibut females, which have a relatively specialized diet (Wolf <em>et al</em>. 2019).","Genetic and spawning unit structuring are present, but are relatively low across the extent of the stock in the eastern Pacific (Drinan&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016, Seitz&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2017).&#160;Low-level genetic differentiation exists between eastern (United States and Canada) and western (Russian) Pacific Ocean sampling locations (Drinan <em>et al.</em> 2016). Connectivity between the western and eastern subpopulations is poorly understood, but studies are underway (Stewart and Hicks 2020). More work is needed to fully understand the genetic population structure of this species.<br/><br/>Overall, this species is more abundant in the eastern Pacific (U.S. and Canada) as compared to in the western Pacific (Russia and Japan) and propagule exchange would be expected to occur from the east to the west (Orlov 2000, 2004). This species has been described as ""abundant"" from the Sea of Japan, the Aleutian Islands, and from the Bering Sea to California, but it is considered ""uncommon"" to ""rare"" in the Artic Ocean (Mecklenburg <em>et al.</em> 2018).&#160;<br/><br/><strong>Russia:</strong> In Russian waters, this species is abundant in the Sea of Okhotsk, the Gulf of Anadyr and the Olyutorsky and Navarinsky regions of the western Bering Sea, but is naturally rare in the Sea of Japan (Batanov<em> et al</em>. 2017, Orlov and Tokranov 2019). In fisheries catches, it is lumped with three other species that are categorized by fishers as 'halibut', including Kamchatka Flounder (<em>Atheresthes evermanni</em>), Arrowtooth Flounder (<em>Atheresthes stomias</em>),&#160;and Greenland Halibut (<em>Reinhardtius hippoglossoides</em>).<em>&#160;</em>The Pacific Halibut and Greenland Halibut represent the majority of the halibut catches with Kamchatka Flounder and Arrowtooth Flounder constituting a very small quantity. Total annual halibut catches were stable around an average of 15,000 tons per year for the period 2008-2019 with a decreasing trend since 2016. Catch per unit effort (CPUE) of halibuts has declined since 2012. According to Russian scientific trawl surveys conducted over the past 42 years (since 1976), the CPUE of this species was stable with no noticeable trend over time. Survey CPUE slightly declined over time in the western Bering Sea, increased in eastern Sakhalin, was stable in western Kamchatka, and declined in eastern Kamchatka and the northern Kurils&#160;(I. Volvenko pers. comm. 2020).<br/><br/>Age structure of the catch in the northwestern Bering Sea did not noticeably&#160;change from the 1930s to the 1960s and did not change in the southern Kuril Islands over the last century. Age composition did change to younger ages in the 2000s in the northern Kuril Islands and southeastern Kamchatka despite suggested relatively low fishing pressure in the western Pacific (Orlov&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2011). From the mid-1980s to the 2000s, biomass of this species increased in the western Bering Sea, the Sea of Okhotsk and eastern Kamchatka. From 1998-2008, catches of this species in the bottom longline fishery operating in the western Bering Sea declined from 1998 to 2000, but increased thereafter. The proportion of the catch that it composed also increased over time (Tuponogov <em>et al</em>. 2013). This species had declined due to high fishing mortality by the early 1970s, but the cessation of targeted fishing effort in 1975-1985 allowed biomass to increase in Russian waters from the mid-1980s to 2000s. In the most recent decade, annual catches exceeded total allowable catch limits in some Russian stocks, and combined with reduced recruitment in recent years, this is cause for concern regarding population status. In the western Bering Sea zone and Karaginskaya subzone, biomass fluctuated widely in some years from 1996 to 2017 but remained above the sustainable total biomass limit. These stocks are currently considered to be stable and exploited at a sustainable level. Biomass in the Petropavlovsko-Komandorskaya subzone has declined since 2007, has remained below the maximum sustainable yield limit since 2012, and is stable at a relatively low level in recent years (Lajus <em>et al</em>. 2019).<br/><br/><strong>United States and Canada: </strong>This species has been commercially fished in North American waters since the 1800s. Large declines occurring through the 1920s may have been a result of increased fishing mortality in the early 1900s. To manage the stock and establish a recovery plan, the International Pacific Halibut Commission (IPHC) was formed in 1923. The stock is assessed as a single unit throughout its known range within the IPHC Convention Area. This known range extends from northern California to the Aleutian Islands and Bering Sea (including Canada but excluding Russia). After improved fishery management and reduced fishing effort, spawning biomass increased overall from about 1930 to 1997. Over the past three generations, or since about 1964, biomass declined somewhat from 1964 to 1980, increased to a peak in 1997, declined by about 70% by 2010 and has been stable at that lower level since then.&#160;<br/><br/>Fluctuations in stock biomass are linked to changes in recruitment, which are related to the decadal changes in productivity of the Northeast Pacific Ocean. The most recent biomass decline is primarily driven by a 50% reduction of individual size-at-age since the 1970s and somewhat weakened recruitment as compared to the 1980s and is not driven by fishing intensity (Stewart and Hicks 2020). Until about 1985, males and females recruited to the fishery in the central Gulf of Alaska at about the same age (males at seven years and females at eight years). As a result, commercial catches were composed of sex ratios relatively similar to underlying abundance (Clark 2004). However, between the mid-1980s and mid-1990s, mean growth rates declined across the population, generating a sex-specific disparity with respect to fishing mortality. Females now enter the central Gulf of Alaska fishery on average at 10 years of age and males at nearly 15 years (Galindo <em>et al</em>. 2011). Size-at-age was also low in the early 1900s. Harvest reductions were made as the modern-day declines were detected. The cause of the reduced size-at-age is unknown (Stewart and Hicks 2020). Size-at-age changes are thought to result from a combination of factors, such as density-dependent competition for food, ocean productivity, size-selective fishing, etc. (see threats section for more details). <br/><br/>The relative spawning biomass has been above the 30% limit since 2015, which indicates fishing intensity is at a sustainable level. In the most recent assessment (2019-2020), it was 32% (Stewart and Hicks 2020). Size-at-age was also low in the early 1900s. Harvest reductions were made as the modern-day declines were detected. The cause of the reduced size-at-age is unknown. Spawning biomass is projected to continue declining through at least the next three years, or until 2023, based on the known strength of cohorts and status quo fishing mortality levels. There are several integral points of uncertainty related to the biology and population dynamics of this species that lead to a high degree of uncertainty in both stock scale and trend (Stewart and Hicks 2020).",Stable,"This species is distributed in the North Pacific Ocean.

This species is of high importance to indigenous peoples of Alaska, British Columbia and the state of Washington. Local management of these fisheries is overseen by the tribal groups and the Northwest Indian Fisheries Commission. The Pacific Halibut sport fishery is substantial in U.S. and Canadian waters and this species is very popular with recreational anglers (IPHC 2014).&#160;<br/><br/>Although this is a highly valuable commercial fish, no specialized fishery exists for this species in Russian waters.&#160;In Russia, it is primarily taken and retained as bycatch in commercial longline, gillnet, Danish Seine, and trawl fisheries (Orlov <em>et al.</em> 2011, Datsky and Maznikova 2017). It is among the dominant species taken in a longline fishery in the western Bering Sea and is also caught by longlines on the shelf in the Sea of Okhotsk and off the Kurils and eastern Kamchatka (Orlov <em>et al.</em> 2011, Tuponogov&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2013, Lajus <em>et al</em>. 2019). <br/><br/>Although interest has been expressed in culturing this species, little progress has been made to rear fish to market siz<span style="""">e (Stickney and Liu 1999).&#160;</span>",Marine,"This is a highly regulated species that has been subject to various management measures throughout its range since at least the 1920s. Regulations are in place for commercial, subsistence and recreational fisheries. The stock in the United States and Canada has been managed by the International Pacific Halibut Commission since 1923 (Stewart and Hicks 2020). Fishing regulations for the U.S. and Canada include total mortality limits, daily bag limits, fish size limits, license and permit requirements, incidental mortality limits, seasonal closures, area closures, and fishing gear restrictions (IPHC 2020). When targeting of groundfishes increased in the early 1960s, bycatch from all areas of the North Pacific steeply increased to a peak in 1965. Bycatch mortality has steadily declined since the early 1990s due to bycatch management measures. In 2011, an Individual Transferable Quota (ITQ) programme was implemented for the U.S. West Coast trawl fishery alongside requirements for 100% observer coverage and a program for managing halibut bycatch, and this substantially reduced bycatch; a similar program also exists in Canadian waters (IPHC 2014). In Alaska, Pacific Halibut bycatch is managed to static mortality limits by the North Pacific Fisheries Management Council. All sources of mortality are included in stock assessment analyses and evaluation of mortality limits set by the IPHC. <br/><br/>There is a total allowable catch limit for this species in Russian waters (Tuponogov&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2013). The longline fishery in the western Bering Sea is subject to catch limits, vessel reporting requirements, and other fishing control measures. Improvements in configuring total allowable catch limits may be needed (Lajus<em> et al</em>. 2019).<br/><br/>Research is needed and is currently underway to understand the level of exchange of individuals between Russian and Alaskan waters. This is especially important as water temperatures are warming in the Bering Sea, which may cause increased population movement across international borders (Stewart and Hicks 2020). Fish condition and growth should be monitored in the Alaskan region to identify early indicators of climate impacts on these life history parameters (Holsman <em>et al.</em> 2019). Furthermore, current estimates of natural mortality are uncertain; as such, more research is needed to improve the estimate of natural mortality.","",,false,false,Global

According to scientific surveys conducted from 1982 to 2018, estimated biomass of species in this complex mostly increased over the 36-year period.

Spawning stock biomass (SSB) also declined by 17% during the same period (2009-2017). SSB has been modeled for the 40-year period of 1977 to 2017, which is nearly three generation lengths. The SSB in 1977 (80,187 t) was similar to that in 2017 (76,053 t). During this period, SSB increased from 1982 to a peak in 1990, declined until 2003, increased to 2008 and has declined since 2013. From peak levels in 1990 at 106,318 t, SSB subsequently declined by 33% to a low of 71,433 t in 2019 (about two past generations). The exploitation rate is relatively low and has been mostly declining since 2008. The next full stock assessment is expected in 2021 (Bryan 2017, Bryan and Palsson 2019). The cause of the recent decline in SSB is not fully understood.

Shifts in distribution of flatfish and other demersal species of the eastern Bering Sea can occur when water temperatures are anomalous, which has been occurring with a climate pattern that has developed in recent years that alternates between above average values for both cold and warm temperatures. This is expected to impact recruitment success and have long-term impacts on the ecosystem (Stevenson and Lauth 2019).&#160;The warming water temperatures that have been ongoing since 2014&#160;in the Bering Sea are expected to be beneficial to this species, but ecological changes related to the continuing climate change need further attention (Yeung and Cooper 2020).

The center of its abundance is on the shelf of the eastern Bering Sea (Walters and Wilderbuer 2000).<br/><br/><strong>Russia:</strong>&#160;This species is common off southeast Kamchatka and has a lower abundance in the Northern Kuril Islands. It is a major component of demersal fisheries in southeast Kamchatka and constitutes 54% of the total flounder catch (Ovcherenko&#160;2018). In Russian waters, abundance of this species can shift with interannual variability in water temperature (Datsky and Andronov 2014). According to Russian scientific trawl surveys conducted over the past 42 years (since the late 1970s), the catch per unit effort (CPUE) of this species slightly increased over time (I. Volvenko pers. comm. 2020).<br/><br/>Catches in eastern Kamchatka and the Northern Kurils peaked in 1999 at 18.4 thousand tons and began a gradual decline thereafter to a low of 6.5 thousand tons in 2007. Catch was 9-9.5 thousand tons in 2010, 2011 and 2012. This represents a 48% decline over a 13-year period. The causes of this decline are not fully understood. One cause may be a change in fishing effort since it is known that the Russian fishing industry changed significantly from the 1990s to the 2010s. Another possible cause could be shifting of abundance upon environmental variability within the fishing region where there are differing levels of exploitation. Modeled estimated biomass from 1950 to 2012 indicate a peak in 1954 at 104.1 thousand tons, a decline in 1965-1971, an increase in the late-1980s to early 1990s with a peak in 1989 at 111 thousand tons and a gradual decline to 46.5 thousand tons in 2012. This represents a 58% decline over a 23-year period. Biomass estimates are complicated by the lack of consistent survey data over a long-term period as well as the exclusion of part of the species' range from the trawl survey coverage (Zolotov&#160;2013).&#160;Annual catches of flatfishes, including this species, in western Kamchatka increased significantly from 1994 to 2000 and the biomass of species of Pleuronectidae declined by 55% from 1997 to 2000. It is likely that this decline was a result of natural causes, not fishing effort (Ilyinsky and&#160;Chetvergov&#160;2002).&#160;Since 2012, scientific survey CPUE in western Kamchatka increased slightly over time to 2018 (I.

This decline is likely caused by the lack of good recruitment as compared to strong levels seen in 2001-2003 and 2005. Compared to 1975 (50,702 t), SSB increased significantly to 2019, or over about the past three generations.&#160;Female spawning biomass is projected to increase from 2022 to at least 2028 in part influenced by the strong recruitment year of 2014. Fishery exploitation is light. Recruitment success is correlated with changes in environmental variables&#160;(Wilderbuer&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2018, 2019). Low ice cover and high bottom water temperature are correlated with higher abundance and northward expansion of this species. Warm water temperatures that have been present in the Bering Sea since 2014 are expected to be beneficial to juveniles of this species (Yeung and Cooper 2020). Models predict that recruitment for the 2015-2018 year classes was above average, which suggests that biomass will increase in the future (Cooper <em>et al.</em> 2019). A spike in recruitment in the northern part of its distribution may indicate that the population is shifting northward (Stevenson and Lauth 2019).",Stable,"This species is distributed in the North Pacific Ocean from off northern Hokkaido, Japan;&#160;the northeastern Sea of Okhotsk; off western and southeastern Kamchatka, Russia; to the Kuril Islands; the Bering Sea, including the Gulf of Anadyr; in Alaskan waters from<span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">&#160;St. Lawrence Island to the Aleutian Islands; and south to Puget Sound, Washington, United States (</span>Sakamoto 1984,&#160;<span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">Orr and Matarese 2000, Mecklenburg <em>et al</em>. 2002,&#160;</span><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">Parin&#160;</span><em>et al</em><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">. 2014</span><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">).

It is highly valued and exploited by commercial flatfish fisheries throughout its range. In U.S. waters, overfishing is not occurring. According to scientific survey data and stock assessment models,&#160;survey biomass in the Gulf of Alaska declined by 43% over the past 35 years, or since 1984 (about two generation lengths), while exploitation has been low. The cause of this decline is not well understood, but it is not likely related to fishing pressu<span style="""">re, but rather&#160;may be related to the population range shift, which alters the proportion of the population existing in surveyed areas. </span>In the eastern Bering Sea, which has a higher abundance than that in the Gulf of Alaska, total and female spawning biomass significantly increased since 1964, or over the past three generation lengths. However, a gradual decline of 23 and 27% has occurred since 1985 and 1994, respectively. The decline is due to reduced recruitment strength, which is caused by interannual changes in bottom water temperatures. Stock assessment models indicate that female spawning biomass is projected to slightly increase through 2032 in the Bering Sea, and biomass has been increasing since 2010 in the northern Bering Sea. Fishery management and monitoring are stringent in U.S. waters and expected to remain in place. Declines over the past one to two generation lengths and projected about one generation into the future do not reach the quantitative thresho<span style="""">lds to qualify for even a Near Threatened status at this time. In Russian waters, biomass of this species has been declining in some areas since the mid-1990s, or a little over one generation length. Cyclical changes in environmental conditions that led to reduced recruitment success are considered the primary cause of this decline, with fishing pressure as a secondary cause in some areas, especially when high fishing pressure occurs during periods of undesirable environmental conditions.&#160;Catch per unit effort in scientific surveys conducted in Russian waters since 1976 was stable over time. Fishing is managed by annual catch limits and some seasonal closure to bottom trawling. Therefore, this species is listed as Least Concern.&#160;</span><span style="""">Reco</span>mmendations include: collecting quantitative data to verify that there is a northward population shift, to evaluate the impacts of changing water temperatures and sea ice extent, as well as to conduct further research on genetics, population structure, movement between the Eastern Bering Sea and the Gulf of Alaska, identifying spawning areas in the Gulf of Alaska, and regarding certain aspects of its life history.&#160;<br/><br/>The findings and conclusions in this document are those of the authors, and do not necessarily represent the views of the National Marine Fisheries Service.","This demersal species occurs on soft and hard bottoms from the continental shelf to the slope. It has a maximum total length of 56 cm (Tuponogov and Kodolov 2014). It conducts an annual feeding migration to the shelf-slope break in the winter and a spawning migration to nearshore waters in spring and summer. Juveniles utilize coastal bays as nursery grounds. The diet primarily consists of polychaete worms, miscellaneous worms, clams, and benthic amphipods. <br/><br/>The natural mortality rate is estimated to be 0.12 and sexual maturity occurs at about 10.5 years of age (TenBrink and Wilderbuer 2015, Spies&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2019). In Russian waters of the southwestern Bering Sea, age and length at first maturity for males is 4.6 years and 21.4 cm and for females, 7.7 years and 28.5 cm (Zolotov 2008).&#160;According to work by the Alaska Fisheries Science Center, it has been aged to a maximum of 40 years (https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/alaska/commercial-fishing/fish-species-maximum-age-data). When applying the equation recommended by the IUCN Red List methods: 1/adult mortality + age of first reproduction, the generation length is estimated to be about 19 years.","Shifts in distribution of flatfishes and other demersal species of the eastern Bering Sea can occur when water temperatures are anomalous, a situation which has been occurring with a climate pattern that has developed in recent years where water temperatures alternate between above average and below average annual values. In addition to impacts in adult habitats, nursery grounds, such as Norton Sound and Kuskokwim-Togiak Bays in the eastern Bering Sea, are also experiencing higher than normal temperatures due to climate change. These anomalous water temperatures are expected to impact growth and condition of juveniles of this species (Spies <em>et al</em>. 2019), which, in turn, likely affect recruitment success and have long-term impacts on the ecosystem (Stevenson and Lauth 2019). In Russian waters, similar declines in biomass are also attributed to cyclical climatic changes that have led to reduced recruitment success, which are amplified by fishing pressure (Zolotov&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014). Anthropogenic activities in nearshore, coastal habitats that serve as nurseries for juveniles are likely to negatively impact this species.","<strong>Russia: </strong>This species is common and abundant in the northwestern Bering Sea (also known as the Olyutorsky-Navarin region),&#160;especially on the Koryak Shelf. Its subpopulation is considered stable there based in part on the continued presence of older individuals in scientific survey catches in the northwestern Bering Sea&#160;(Datsky and Maznikova 2017). It is also common in the Sea of Okhotsk and western Kamchatka shelf (Napazakov 2015), and northeastern Kamchatka (Orlov <em>et al.</em> 2020). According to Russian scientific trawl surveys conducted over the past 42 years (since the late 1970s), the catch per unit effort (CPUE) of this species was stable with no noticeable trend over time (I. Volvenko pers. comm. 2020).<br/><br/>This species is the primary target of flounder fisheries in the Sea of Okhotsk. Fishing mortality was high in the mid-1970s but declined with the reduction of effort when EEZ boundaries were implemented in the late 1970s (Dyakov 2014). The fishery remains active but is no longer open access (Yusupov 2014). Exploitation remained at low levels until 2004 when an industrial targeted fishery began in the Magadan region of the northern Sea of Okhotsk (Pustovoit and Yusupov 2011). Off Sakhalin Island, targeted fishing of this species began in the late 1940s. Catches were high in the 1950s, but declined in the 1960s to an average of 2.6 thousand tons, and averaged between 1.7 to 2.1 thousand t to the 1990s. Abundance of this species was high in the 1950s to 1960s and 1985-1995, but declined in 1970-1980 and in the mid-1990s to 2013 (the terminal year of data).&#160;Similar patterns were reported in the western Bering Sea and for the western Kamchatka shelf. <span style="""">The primary cause of decline is attributed to natural cyclical fluctuations in water temperature that led to reduced recruitment success, but fishing pressure during the years of undesirable conditions is considered to amplify such declines. </span>In the 15-20 years preceding 2014, fishing effort changed due to a large-scale reorganization of the fishing fleet. In western Sakhalin in 2001-2013, fishing effort was unsustainable. Changes in the size and age composition from 2001 to 2012 indicated the stock underwent a sharp decline. In 2014, new regulations were introduced to address overfishing. Scientific bottom trawl surveys were conducted from 2000-2013 off Sakhalin, and according to those data, the biomass of this species averaged 5 thousand tons in 2000-2005, but then declined by about 60% to 1.6-2.1 thousand t&#160;in 2007-2013, with a low of 1.1 thousand t recorded in 2010. In eastern Sakhalin, targeted fishing began in the 1950s and the stock gradually declined as the average annual catch declined significantly to 4.6 thousand tons in the 1960s, 2.9 thousand t in the 1970s and less than 1 thousand t by the early 1980s. A flounder fishing moratorium was implemented from 1981 to 1990. Fishing was reinstated with stricter controls in 1991-1994, and catches gradually increased to 5.6 thousand t in 2000 and afterwards averaged 2.7 thousand tons to 2013, with a range from 1.6-4.6 thousand t. Similar to the subpopulation off western Sakhalin, that off the eastern coast is also suspected to be undergoing some level of overfishing in the 2000s based on changes in the size and age composition of individuals in the catches in 2000-2012 (Zolotov <em>et al</em>. 2014).&#160;Survey CPUE in east Sakhalin since 2013 slightly declined over time to 2018 and the species did not occur in survey catches in 2015 and 2016 (I. Volvenko pers. comm. 2020).<br/><br/>In the Pacific waters off the northern Kurils and southeastern Kamchatka, the highest survey indices were observed during 1994-1998, with lowest values in 1992-1993 and 1999-2002 (Orlov and Tokranov 2014). On the western Kamchatka shelf, this species constitutes the majority of the flounder catch and its stock increased until the late 1990s (Dyakov 2009). According to scientific surveys conducted on the western Kamchatka shelf, biomass of all species of Pleuronectidae&#160;harvested significantly declined from a peak of a little over 1 million tons in 1997 to about 400 thousand t in 2000, and catches remained between 400-500 thousand t until the terminal year of data in 2010. This decline is thought to be due to natural causes rather than overfishing since exploitation levels were below catch limits (Gorbatenko and&#160;Savin&#160;2012). Survey CPUE of this species in western Kamchatka since 2010 was stable over time to 2018 (I. Volvenko pers. comm. 2020).&#160;In southeastern Kamchatka, this species constitutes a lower proportion (15%) of the flounder catch. Stocks of flounder declined there in the 1960s to a minimum in the mid-1970s, increased in the 1980s to the mid-1990s and then declined again from 2001-2006. Declines are thought to be due to natural cycles, but further study is needed (Zolotov and&#160;Zakharov&#160;2008). In northeastern Kamchatka in the Karaginsky and Olutorsky bays, this species constitutes&#160;45-85% of the catch in Danish seine and trawl fisheries, and declines in size and age of this species in the early 2000s are thought to have been caused by overfishing (Zolotov 2008). Off Primorye, in the Sea of Japan, where this species constitutes&#160;a dominant portion of the flatfish catch, abundance of flatfishes declined since the mid-1990s to at least the early 2000s. Since fishing levels were low and slightly declined over time, this decline is inferred to be due to changes in productivity during the natural 50-year cycling of cold and warm periods. Flatfish abundance was high during warm periods and low during cold periods (Antonenko 2007).<br/><br/><strong>United States</strong>: The abundance of this species is naturally lower in the Gulf of Alaska than it is in the Bering Sea. In the Gulf of Alaska, this species is managed as part of the ""shallow-water flatfish stock complex"", which besides this species, is primarily composed of Alaska Plaice (<em>Pleuronectes quadrituberculatus</em>), English Sole (<em>Parophrys vetulus</em>), Sand Sole (<em>Psettichthys melanostictus</em>), Starry Flounder (<em>Platichthys stellatus</em>), Butter Sole (<em>Isopsetta isolepis</em>), Northern Rock Sole (<em>Lepidopsetta polyxystra</em>), and Southern Rock Sole (<em>Lepidopsetta bilineata</em>). According to the most recent stock assessment, overfishing is not occurring and the exploitation rate on this complex is relatively low. According to scientific surveys conducted from 1984 to 2019 in the Gulf of Alaska, biomass of this species declined overall by 43% from 1984 to 2019, or over the past 35 years (Turnock&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2017, Bryan 2019<span style="""">). This decline is not well understood, but fishing was not likely to be a driver. The exploitation rate (i.e., catch/biomass) has been less than 0.001 per year since 1993 (Bryan 2019). Temperature-mediated differences in seasonal spawning migrations into and out of inshore areas effect the availability of the population to trawl surveys in the eastern Bering Sea (Nichol <em>et al</em>. 2019), and a similar phenomenon may affect survey-based biomass estimates in the Gulf of Alaska. The connectivity between the Eastern Bering Sea and the Gulf of Alaska is not well understood. However, a large proportion of the population in the Gulf of Alaska is concentrated near the western boundary of the survey area, and there are no notable barriers between the survey area and the Aleutian Islands to the west, or the Bering Sea to the north. Thus, some proportion of the population may be moving out of the Gulf of Alaska and into the surrounding regions over time&#160;(M</span>. Bryan and D. Stevenson pers. comm. 2020).&#160;<br/><br/>This is one of the most abundant flatfish species in the eastern Bering Sea, but it is encountered in low abundance in the Aleutian Islands. The bottom trawl fishery, which included foreign fleets, began targeting this species on the Bering Sea shelf in 1954 and this stock was overexploited by 1959-1962. In the later 1970s, fishing effort was reduced, and the stock showed recovery by the early 1980s. The most recent assessment of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands stock concluded that overfishing is not occurring and it is not overfished nor approaching an overfished condition, but the stock has been in a slowly declining condition since 1994, or over the past 26 years. According to scientific surveys conducted in the eastern Bering Sea since 1982, biomass declined by 45% from 1983 to 1986, and has mostly fluctuated somewhat at around 2 to 2.5 million tons since then (34 years). Variability in this survey's estimate of biomass is in part due to the level of overlap in the timing of the survey and timing of annual spawning migrations into nearshore areas not sampled by the survey. The migration to inshore spawning grounds occurs earlier than normal in warm water years and somatic growth also increases. Biomass estimates are generally lower in years with colder shelf bottom temperatures. Water temperature has been warmer than the mean annual temperature in recent years. Survey biomass&#160;in&#160;the northern Bering Sea increased from 310,617 t in 2010 to&#160;520,029 t in 2019. A large-scale shift of abundance from the eastern Bering Sea to the northern part has not yet been detected but this possibility should be monitored as climate change progresses.&#160;Total biomass and female spawning biomass (FSB) have been modeled for the 65-year period of 1954 to 2019. Total biomass was low in the 1960s and early 1970s, but doubled between 1975 and 1979, peaked at 4,025,010&#160;t in 1985 and slowly declined thereafter by 23% to 3,090,480 t in&#160;2019, or over the past 35 years. FSB increased to a peak of 1,455,350&#160;t in 1994 and then gradually declined thereafter by 27% to 1,062,990 t in 2019, or over the past 26 years. This decline is likely caused by mostly below average recruitment strength in the years from 1984-2005. Compared to 1964 (26,218&#160;t), FSB increased significantly to 2019 (1,062,990 t), or over the past three generations.&#160;FSB is projected to slightly increase through 2032. The exploitation rate is low to moderate (Nichol <em>et al.</em> 2019, Spies <em>et al.</em> 2019). Due to warming temperatures in the Bering Sea, the population might be shifting northward outside the historical extent of scientific surveys, and this would introduce uncertainty to biomass estimates (I. Spies and D. Stevenson pers. comm. 2020).",Decreasing,"This species is distributed in the North Pacific and Arctic oceans from Korea to the Beaufort Sea, and south to&#160;<span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">Canada (</span><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">Hart 1973</span><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">, Mecklenburg&#160;</span><em>et al</em><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">. 2002</span><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">).&#160;</span>In the western Pacific, it occurs in the Sea of Japan, from Busan (South Korea), Peter the Great Bay, Primorye, and&#160;the Tatar Strait; all coasts of Hokkaido; the Sea of Okhotsk; southeastern Kamchatka; the Bering, Chukchi, and Beaufort seas; and south to&#160;<span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">Barkley Sound, British Columbia, Canada (Hart 1973, Sakamoto 1984a,b; Mecklenburg <em>et al</em>. 2002,&#160;</span><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">Shinohara&#160;</span><em>et al</em><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">. 2011, Nakabo 2013, Parin&#160;</span><em>et al</em><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">. 2014</span><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">).&#160;</span><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">The depth range is 4-716 metres, but it typically occurs shallower than 150 m (Mecklenburg <em>et al</em>. 2002, Shinohara <em>et al</em>. 2011, Nakabo 2013, Parin <em>et al</em>. 2014, Kells&#160;</span><em>et al.</em><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">&#160;2016, I.

Fishery-independent scientific surveys have been conducted annually in the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands since 1982. Survey biomass of this species in the Bering Sea was highest in 1982 at 103,806 t before declining from 1983 to 1985 to 9,107 t, although the variability around these data years is high. From 1985 to 2007, biomass was stable at an average of 13,000 t, but since 2007 it declined by about 90% from 16,733 t to a time series low of 1,647 t in 2015 (Wilderbuer and Nichol 2015, 2018, 2019). The cause of this decline is not well understood, but is not thought to be related to fishing activities. The survey in the Bering Sea does not sample the shallow, coastal parts of the distribution of this species, which introduces uncertainty to the biomass estimates. In addition, substantial areas of suitable habitat are available in the Bering Sea, an area not regularly surveyed, where this species is potentially shifting northward to as sea ice extent decreases over time (D.

It is not overfished, and overfishing is not occurring, and annual catches have been well below the total allowable catch limit in recent years. Modeled total biomass for the Gulf of Alaska shows about a 40% decline since 1987, or 33 years (about one and a half generation lengths) although there is some uncertainty associated with this trend as most scientific surveys do not extend to the deep depths that this species occupies.

Spawning biomass models for the U.S. West coast (Washington to California) show a slight decline (about 18%) since the 1920s. Shifts in biomass may be caused by movements that the species conducts ontogenetically to offshore areas, as well as movements to follow preferable water temperatures, which can fluctuate interannually. Comprehensive fisheries management and the conservation measures related to this are expected to remain in place in the U.S.&#160;and Canada.&#160;It does not meet the quantitative thresholds to qualify even for a Near Threatened status at this time; therefore, it is listed as Least Concern with a recommendation to conduct research on the cause of the possible decline in the Gulf of Alaska.&#160;<br/><br/>The findings and conclusions in this document are those of the authors, and do not necessarily represent the views of the National Marine Fisheries Service.","This demersal species occurs over sandy and muddy bottoms from nearshore to the continental slope.

It exhibits an extended spawning season in the Gulf of Alaska from January to August with a peak in May (Abookire and Macewicz 2003). Females conduct a seasonal feeding migration to shallower depths on the mid-continental shelf in the summer. Diets consist of benthic infaunal (mostly) and epifaunal invertebrates (Hart 1973). <br/><br/>The maximum observed age is 59 years, age at first maturity is 12.5 years, and the natural mortality rate is 0.085 (McGilliard&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2019).

The exploitation rate has been low in recent years. Biomass in the Hecate Strait stock has been increasing since 1984. The Queen Charlotte Sound stock biomass has been increasing since 2006. The West Coast of Vancouver Island stock biomass has had a flat trend&#160;since 2006. Overall, it is not considered overfished and overfishing is not occurring, although the stock assessment recognized a significant amount of uncertainty associated with the relative terminal biomass and harvest rate (Johnson and Cox 2019).<br/><br/><strong>United States:</strong>&#160;In the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands, this species is managed as part of the ""other flatfish complex"", which besides this species, primarily consists of Rex Sole (<em>Glyptocephalus zachirus</em>), Starry Flounder (<em>Platichthys stellatus</em>), Longhead Dab (<em>Myzopsetta proboscidea</em>) and Butter Sole (<em>Isopsetta isolepis</em>).<strong>&#160;</strong>It is not targeted in this area but is retained as bycatch in fisheries that target&#160;other flatfish species and Pacific Cod.

Fishery-independent scientific surveys have been conducted annually in the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands since 1982, but this species composes a small part of the catch in part due to its deeper depth preference beyond the scope of most surveys. Also, it is naturally relatively rare in the Bering Sea, with a much higher abundance in the Gulf of Alaska, although this could be partly attributed to the limited sampling effort in deeper depth strata. Commercial fishing in Alaskan waters also does not frequently occur at the deeper depths that this species occupies (D. Stevenson pers. comm. 2020). Nonetheless, modeled biomass of this species has had a mostly increasing trend in this area since at least about 1990. The next full stock assessment will be published in 2020 (Wilderbuer and Nichol 2015, 2018, 2019).<br/><br/>In the Gulf of Alaska, this species is managed as part of the ""deepwater flatfish complex"", which besides this species, is also composed of&#160;Greenland Turbot (<em>Reinhardtius hippoglossoides</em>) and Deepsea Sole (<em>Microstomus bathybius</em>). The Dover Sole (<em>Microstomus pacificus</em>) composes the majority (77%) of the catch. According to the most recent assessment of this stock, overfishing is not occurring, and this stock is not overfished nor approaching an overfished condition. Fishery-independent scientific surveys conducted annually in the Gulf of Alaska since 1990 show that biomass has mostly declined over the past 29 years, or a little over one past generation. Survey biomass was 104,959 t in 1990, experienced a secondary peak of 101,509 t in 2003 and reached a low of 48,452 t in 2019, which represents about a 54% decline.

Spawning biomass showed a similar trend with a peak in 1989 at 48,650 t and a gradual 45% decline to 27,011 t in 2021. Spawning biomass has been in a declining trend since 2013.&#160;The decline in biomass is not well-understood but could reflect changes in its catchability or natural mortality. Fishing intensity has been exceptionally low and annual catches have been well below the total allowable catch limit (TAC) in recent years in part due to a shift in targeting. Over the history of the fishery, catches have been exceptionally low except in the years from 1991 to 1993 (McGilliard <em>et al</em>. 2019). The relatively high exploitation rate in the 1990s could have contributed to this decline, but fishing effort has declined overall. Availability of this species to the surveys introduces uncertainty to&#160;the survey biomass trend.&#160;Survey effort in the deeper depth strata of the Gulf of Alaska has decreased, and a warm period in 2016 may have caused the population to shift to deeper, colder waters that are outside the survey extent&#160;(D.

This stock has tended to move northward along this coast since the mid-1990s&#160;(Selden <em>et al</em>. 2020). In this region, specifically the California Current System, recruitment success and the spatial distribution of biomass of this species fluctuates with climate/environmental conditions, with abundance shifting southward during cool phases and northward during warm phases (<span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">Keller&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2013).&#160;</span>Landings of this species have been declining across all three states (Washington, Oregon and California) since 2009, but the exploitation rate has remained low and spawning biomass is well above the management target. According to models, spawning biomass declined slightly (about 18%) over the entire time series, or since the 1920s. Spawning biomass declined slightly between the 1970s and early 1990s, reached a low in the mid-1990s, increased through much of the 2000s, and then declined slightly from 2010 to 2019.

According to fishery independent scientific surveys, biomass on the eastern Bering Sea shelf has been gradually declining since 1984 (over about two past generations), but remains at sustainable levels. This decline may be attributed to a northward shift in the population to areas beyond the extent of surveys. Exploitation has been light, and it is not considered to be overfished.

It also enters estuaries and brackish lagoons (Dyldin and Orlov 2017).&#160;Juveniles occur in shallow coastal waters and larger individuals occur deeper, but typically shallower than 110 m in summer. The physiology of this species allows it to tolerate very cold temperatures as the blood contains a glycol-protein that inhibits ice crystal formation. It is not known what impact warm waters has on the species, but it does appear to prefer colder temperatures. The maximum total length is 66 cm (Datsky and Maznikova 2017, Mecklenburg&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2018), but according to Zhang <em>et al</em>. (1998), an average size of trawl caught fish in the Bering Sea is about 32 cm.&#160;<br/><br/>Natural mortality is estimated at 0.13 (Wilderbuer and Nichol 2019). Age and length at first maturity are 32 cm and 9.5 years (TenBrink and Wilderbuer 2015). According to work by the Alaska Fisheries Science Center, it has been aged to a maximum of 37 years (Matta 2012). When applying the equation recommended by the IUCN Red List methods: 1/adult mortality + age of first reproduction, the generation length is estimated to be about 17 years.",Fishing activity is not expected to be driving population declines approaching levels at which the species would qualify even for Near Threatened status at this time.,"<strong>Russia:</strong>&#160;In Russian waters, this species has the highest density off western Kamchatka and in the Bering Sea (Napazakov 2018). It&#160;is not uncommon off the western coast of Sakhalin Island (Kim and Kim 2019). It is common and abundant in the northwestern Sea of Okhotsk (Saveliev <em>et al.</em> 2019) and common in the northwestern Bering Sea (Savin 2018) and off northeastern Kamchatka (Orlov <em>et al.</em> 2020). It is rare in the northwestern Sea of Japan (Panchenko<em> et al</em>. 2016) and has a low abundance in the Kuril Islands (Orlov and Tokranov 2014). According to Russian scientific trawl surveys conducted over the past 42 years (since the late 1970s), the catch per unit effort of this species increased over time (I. Volvenko pers. comm. 2020).<br/><br/>It is taken in commercial fisheries in Terpeniya Bay, in the northern part of the Tatar Strait off the coast of Aleksandrovsk-Sakhalinsky and other more northern areas (Dyldin and Orlov 2017). On the Chukchi shelf, the biomass of this species significantly increased in the early 2010s in part due to a period of particularly cold water present in the area (Gavrilov and Glebov 2013). In the Karaginsky and Olutorsky bays of northeastern Kamchatka, biomass of this species gradually increased since the mid-1990s through to at least 2012. On the West Kamchatka shelf, the flounder stock, which includes this species, is considered underexploited as of 2011. The flounder stock declined in the early 1980s to the 1990s but has been increasing since 2006 to at least 2011. Fishing effort has declined significantly since the 1980s and 1990s (Zolotov&#160;<em>et&#160;al.</em> 2013).&#160;Biomass of this species has been increasing since the early 2000s off northeastern Sakhalin Island (Tok 2014). The multi-species demersal fish stock of the northwestern Bering Sea is dominated by&#160;Pacific Cod (<em>Gadus macrocephalus</em>), but Alaska Plaice occupies a subdominant position. Biomass of this mixed-species stock was very high in the mid-1980s, significantly declined in the late 1990s to early 2000s, and has been increasing since the mid-2000s (Savin and&#160;Glebov&#160;2016).<br/><br/><strong>United States:</strong>&#160;This species is more abundant in the Bering Sea as compared to the Gulf of Alaska. In the Gulf of Alaska, this species is managed as part of the ""shallow-water flatfish stock complex"", which besides this species, is primarily composed of Starry Flounder (<em>Platichthys stellatus</em>), English Sole (<em>Parophrys vetulus</em>), Sand Sole (<em>Psettichthys melanostictus</em>), Butter Sole (<em>Isopsetta isolepis</em>), Yellowfin Sole (<em>Limanda aspera</em>), Northern Rock Sole (<em>Lepidopsetta polyxystra</em>) and Southern Rock Sole (<em>Lepidopsetta bilineata</em>). According to the most recent stock assessment, overfishing is not occurring and the exploitation rate on this complex is relatively low. According to scientific surveys, biomass of this species in the Gulf of Alaska from 1984 to 2019 fluctuated widely between years, but overall, increased over time. Biomass peaked in 2017 at 13,784 t, but then declined the following survey year by 67% to 4,617&#160;t (Turnock<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2017, Bryan 2019).&#160;<br/><br/>The Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands stock is mostly concentrated on the eastern Bering Sea shelf, with only small amounts present in the Aleutian Islands. In warm years, it occurs further north,&#160;and further south in cold years. From 1975 to 2019, this species has been only lightly exploited, and has been primarily taken as bycatch in the fishery that targets Yellowfin Sole. The stock is in a state of slow decline, but according to the most recent stock assessment, overfishing is not occurring, and it is not overfished nor approaching an overfished condition. Fishery independent scientific surveys were conducted on the eastern Bering Sea shelf in 1975 and from 1979 to 2019.&#160; Estimated total biomass increased from 459,100 t in 1975 to a peak of 750,000 t in 1984, declined to 545,300 t in 2003, increased to 563,300 t in 2006 and gradually declined thereafter to 424,400 t in 2019. Total biomass&#160;was relatively stable from 1982 to 2012, but has been declining since 2012. Over the entirety of the period (since 1975 or about two and a half past generations), biomass in 2019 (424,400 t) was near the same level as that of 1975 (459,100 t). Since the peak in 1984, or over the past 35 years (about two generations), biomass declined by 41% to 2019. Survey biomass has also declined since peaking in 1984. Female spawning biomass has slowly declined since 1985 but remains at sustainable levels. Recruitment was below average from 2005 to 2015, which is a particularly extended period and likely contributed to the overall decline in biomass, though strong recruitment occurred in 2014. In years when the survey included stations north of St. Lawrence Island (2010, 2017 and 2019), large amounts of this species were captured, which may indicate some pole-ward movement of the stock occurred, but further investigation is needed. Temperatures in the eastern Bering Sea have varied widely in recent years, and it is not yet understood what potential impact this may have on this species that has a clear preference for cold water (Wilderbuer and Nichol 2019). The population is likely shifting northward outside the survey extent, so the decline in survey biomass may be attributed to that (D. Stevenson pers. comm. 2020).",Stable,"This species is distributed in the North Pacific Ocean and adjacent southern Arctic Ocean. In the northwestern Pacific, it occurs throughout the waters surrounding Hokkaido, Japan and off Russia, from Peter the Great Bay to the southern Gulf of Anadyr, the Tatar Strait, the Sea of Okhotsk, the southern and northern Kuril Islands, and southeastern Kamchatka; and in the Bering Sea to the southern Chukchi Sea. In the eastern Pacific, it occurs from the southern Chukchi Sea, to the eastern Bering Sea,&#160;to off Unalaska Island, and in the Gulf of Alaska to near Ketchikan, Alaska (Sakamoto 1984; Mecklenburg <em>et al</em>. 2002, 2018). A single record records this species (as <em>P. pallasii</em>) from Bellingham Bay, Washington (Townsend 1936; Sakamoto 1984; Mecklenburg <em>et al</em>. 2002, 2018). The depth range is 0-850 metres (Nakabo 2013, Parin<em> et al</em>. 2014, Kells <em>et al</em>. 2016), but is more common shallower than 200 m (Mecklenburg <em>et al</em>. 2002, 2018; Napazakov 2018).","This species is an important component of commercial fisheries in Russian waters in the northwestern Bering Sea (Datsky and Andronov 2014, Parin<em>&#160;et al</em>. 2014). It is retained as bycatch in bottom trawl fisheries in U.S. waters, especially in the fishery that targets Yellowfin Sole. It is sometimes discarded due to relatively low market value, though retention has increased in recent years (Wilderbuer and Nichol 2019).",Marine,"The subpopulation of this species in U.S. waters is closely monitored through scientific surveys and annual stock assessments. It is managed through the Bering Sea/Aleutian Islands Groundfish Fishery Management Plan and the Gulf of Alaska Groundfish Fishery Management Plan. Fishing is regulated through permitting, size limits, daily and total catch limits, seasonal and area fishing closures, gear restrictions, and a trawl catch share program. Research is needed on the genetic structure of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands stock (Wilderbuer and Nichol 2019). An increase in scientific survey effort in the northern Bering Sea is needed to better understand likely northward shifts in its distribution and to improve monitoring of abundance trends (D. Stevenson pers. comm. 2020). <br/><br/>In Russian waters, there is a common total allowable catch (TAC) for the primary flatfish species (Alaska Plaice, Yellowfin Sole, and Flathead Sole) of the stocks off western Kamchatka. This TAC is based on data from bottom trawl surveys and the mean proportion of particular species in the total flatfish catch (A. Orlov pers. comm. 2020).","",,false,false,Global

Individuals are solitary and tend to stay within 3 meters of benthic substrates, where they sometimes rest (Berger <em>et al</em>. 2015). Once settled this species is thought to establish home ranges of 500 – 3,000 m<sup>2</sup> that they actively defend (Berger <em>et al.</em> 2015, Kells <em>et al</em>. 2016). Kelp Greenlings are diurnal generalist mesopredators that feed on a variety of crustaceans, worms and small fish, and are preyed upon by many species such as rockfish, pinnipeds and seabirds (Berger<em> et al</em>. 2015).<br/><br/>Kelp Greenling can attain a maximum total length of 63 cm, despite rarely growing over 50 cm, and live up to 25 years (Cope and MacCall 2005, Berger <em>et al</em>. 2015). It grows faster in the first three years of life, after which growth rate decreases especially in males, and by year 5 or 6 females are generally larger than males (Howard 2001). Like other species of the genus <em>Hexagrammos</em>, males guard nests with up to 11 separate clutches of eggs, often in different stages of development and from different females (Berger&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2015, Kells <em>et al. </em>2016). Females batch spawn from September - December and can produce at least 3 clutches of eggs that they lay on rocks, rock crevices and kelp in a male’s nests after courtship, and that these will guard through the winter (Hutchins <em>et al.</em> 2003, Cope and MacCall 2005). After hatching in January-February, young spend several months as epipelagic larvae, settling as juveniles when they reach 5-6 cm in length (Cope and MacCall 2005, Berger <em>et al</em>. 2015). Hatching times vary with geographical location occurring from December-February in northern California and getting progressively earlier further north: January in Puget Sound, and August-September in Alaska (Howard 2001). One study estimated 50% females to be mature at 29.3 cm (Berger <em>et al.</em> 2015), while others estimate age at first maturity to be 3 - 4 years old (Fitch and Lavenberg 1971, Howard 2001). Estimations vary, calculating females lay approximately 1,580 – 9,660 eggs per cluster (De Martini 1986, Howard 2001), and a total egg production of 28,500 – 125,000 per year (Berger <em>et al.</em> 2015).<br/><br/>Natural mortality rates have been estimated in Oregon as 0.34 yr<sup>-1</sup> for females and 0.45 yr<sup>-1</sup> for males (though recent meta-analysis suggest 0.36 yr<sup>-1</sup> for females and 0.32&#160; yr<sup>-1</sup> for males), and in California as 0.28 yr-<sup>1</sup> for females and 0.39 yr<sup>-1</sup> for males. Differences in natural mortality for the different sexes are expected due to the different growth rates (Cope and MacCall 2005, Berger<em> et al. </em>2015).","There are no known major threats to this species. However, due to its territorial behavior, males are particularly vulnerable to recreational and commercial fisheries when guarding eggs. If left unchecked, this could lead to overfishing of local populations (Howard 2001).

It dates to subsistence harvest by native American tribes, until the late 1980s – mid 1990s it was mainly exploited by recreational fishers, and since then a directed commercial fishery was established (Cope and MacCall 2005,&#160;Berger <em>et al</em>. 2015).</p>  <p>This species has long been an important component of recreational fisheries (Cope and MacCall 2005). In California it was considered one of the most important components of sports catch (Lea <em>et al.</em> 1999), with surveys indicating that, between 1958 – 1961, 54,000 Kelp Greenlings were taken by hook and line and 2,000 by spear fishermen in this state (Howard 2001). These surveys also revealed it as the most frequently caught by shore fishers north of San Francisco (Howard 2001). Later surveys conducted between 1980 – 1999, estimated the sport catch to average 106,650 fish per year, with 103,000 of those being taken between Monterey Bay and the Oregon border (Howard 2001). There were no management regulations for recreational capture of this species in California until 1999, when a 12 inch-size and 10 fish/day limits were implemented (Cope and MacCall 2005). At this time, it was also included in the California recreational regulatory complex Rockfish, Cabezon and Greenlings that is subject to seasonal closures (Cope and MacCall 2005). In Oregon, the importance of the recreational Kelp Greenling harvest is poorly documented before the early 1970s (Berger <em>et al.</em> 2015). However, management of this fishery began in 1976 when a daily bag limit was implemented for the group of species that included <em>H. decagrammus</em>. This limit has varied throughout the years and, in 2004, Oregon also implemented a size limit (Berger <em>et al. </em>2015). Finally, Washington has never had substantial recreational removals (Berger <em>et al.</em> 2015). No assessment is available for its populations in British Columbia and Alaska (J. Cope pers. comm. 2019).</p>  Despite the historical importance of the recreational sector in this species' exploitation history, in the late 1990s a live fish commercial fishery was developed in southern California and spread northward becoming the major source of removal in the past decades (Cope and MacCall 2005, Berger <em>et al</em>. 2015). This species has long been considered of good quality and present in fresh fish markets, however it was not targeted by commercial fisheries and only the bycatch of lingcod or rockfish fisheries was absorbed by the market (Jordan and Gilbert 1881, Fitch and Lavenberg 1971). The recent commercial fishery mainly uses hook-and-line and traps and sells to the fresh fish market or live to restaurants (Howard 2001, Cope and MacCall 2005). In the mid and late-1990s, most of the commercial landings were reported from California, however, Oregon surpassed it in the early 2000s (Cope and MacCall 2005). Stock assessments from Oregon (Cope and MacCall 2005, Berger <em>et al.</em> 2015) indicate that this substock is healthy and above its target biomass level (Cope and MacCall 2005). Since 2004, when management limits were implemented for the commercial fishery, landings have been stable; however, they are predicted to increase in the future and, considering the population size is unknown, precautionary management should be taken (Cope and MacCall 2005, Berger <em>et al.</em> 2015).",Marine,"This species occurs in marine protected areas in parts of its range, such as in the Big Creek Marine Ecological Reserve (Yoklavich <em>et al</em>. 2002) and in Race Rocks Ecological Reserve, where it is one of the most abundant demersal fish (Fletcher 2001). Furthermore, it has fisheries management plans throughout its range that limit catch numbers and sizes. Considering the expected development of the commercial fishery, management and monitoring should be continued (Cope and MacCall 2005, Berger <em>et al.</em> 2015).","",,false,false,Global

It is common and locally abundant, not heavily exploited and there are no known major threats; therefore, this species is listed as Least Concern.","This demersal species can be found in exposed coastal areas, over rocky bottoms associated with vegetation and kelp, that it uses for feeding, shelter and egg laying, avoiding completely open areas (Gomelyuk 2000, Orlov and Zolotov 2010, Kells <em>et al</em>. 2016). Despite being a marine species, it can also occur in brackish water and estuaries (Dyldin and Orlov 2017). There are seasonal changes in the vertical distribution of this species. During the winter, individuals can be found at the continental slope below a wintering cooling water mass; between February and April, with the advection of relatively warm water, the Spring pre-spawning migration to the lower margin of the continental shelf takes place and, in Summer, spawning occurs in sublittoral areas; finally, in Autumn, this species migrates back to the lower margin of the shelf and upper bathyal zone (Zolotov 1985, Orlov and Zolotov 2010). Rock Greenlings have a patchy distribution in habitat being either absent or found in groups (Gomelyuk 2000). These groups appear stable and, considering individual coloration, consist of individuals that are familiar to each other (Gomelyuk 2000). This species feeds mainly at night and on the bottom surface, on a wide food spectrum consisting mainly of algae, invertebrates and small fish, but can also hunt larger prey in groups (Gomelyuk 2000, Reisewitz <em>et al</em>. 2005, Kells <em>et al</em>. 2016).<br/><br/>Rock Greenlings can attain a maximum length of 58 cm, with females generally larger than males, and live up to 18 years (Beamish <em>et al</em>. 2006, Orlov and Zolotov 2010). Orlov and Zolotov (2010) determined 50% of females were mature at 35.5 cm and all were mature at 45 cm, in Kamchatka and Kuril Islands, and Matarese and colleagues (1989) calculated age at first maturity to be 3-4 years. Spawning takes place between June and September, depending on the locality, in rocks or algal holdfasts in areas with strong currents (Matarese 1989). Females lay 14,400 – 103,000 eggs that are probably guarded by males, like other species of the genus (Zolotov 1985, Matarese 1989).","There are no known major threats to this species. A study in the Aleutian Islands has associated <em>Hexagrammos lagocephalus</em> population declines with sea otter population declines and the associated kelp forest collapse (Reisewitz <em>et al</em>. 2005). Furthermore, this species is an order of magnitude more abundant in kelp forests than in sea urchin barrens, indicating that threats to kelp forests or the trophic cascade may be threatening to Rock Greenling populations (Reisewitz <em>et al.</em> 2005).","This species is apparently common throughout its range and locally abundant (Isakson <em>et al.</em> 1971, Orlov and Zolotov 2010).",Unknown,"This species is widely distributed in the North Pacific, occurring from Point Conception, California to Japan and the Yellow Sea (Kells <em>et al.</em> 2016).

It is common, not commercially exploited and there are no known major threats; therefore, this species is listed as Least Concern.","This marine, demersal fish inhabits rocky reefs in the intertidal and subtidal areas, characterized by high relief topography, as well as kelp forests, pilings and wharves (DeMartini and Anderson 1980, Bodkin 1986, Pietsch and Orr 2019). Individuals are solitary and territorial defending relatively small home ranges (DeMartini 1976). Males generally occur in all male areas where they maintain a home range smaller than 10 m<sup>2</sup>, in central high relief areas of the reef, that include spawning sites and shelter holes (DeMartini 1976, 1987). Females generally inhabit peripheral, lower relief areas of the reef, where they maintain larger home ranges that include several male spawning sites, and defend shelter holes (DeMartini 1976, 1987). During colder months, individuals become inactive within shelter holes and are almost not observable (DeMartini and Anderson 1980). This species is a facultative commensal of the anemones <em>Urticina lofotensis</em> and <em>Urticina piscivora</em>, however it associates more often with the first (Elliot 1992). Juveniles below 12 cm TL and young of the year can be found next to the column or in the oral disk of these anemones, especially at night (Elliot 1992). The skin's mucous coating protects the fish from the anemone’s tentacles, and they can find shelter in them (Elliot 1992, McCosker 2006). <em>Oxylebius pictus</em> of all ages feed on the copepods associated with the anemones, however this food source is particularly important for young of the year that recently settled from plankton (Elliot 1992).<br/><br/>Throughout their range size at first maturity varies but not age (DeMartini 1976). In northern populations, males are mature at 14.3 cm TL and females at 17.1 cm TL; while in the south, males are 12.3 cm TL and females are 14 cm TL. Independently of locality and size, all males are first mature at 2 years old and females at 3 years of age (DeMartini and Anderson 1980). In Puget Sound, males attain first maturity at about 2 years old, but were not observed tending eggs until age three, and most did not spawn until age 4&#160; (DeMartini 1976). Females lay egg masses of around 1,500 - 5,000 eggs, depending on female size, in rock crevices and invertebrate incrustations in a male’s territory, 3 to 4 times per spawning season (DeMartini 1976, 1987). Egg masses are then guarded by the male for about 2.5 – 3.5 weeks until hatching (DeMartini 1976, 1987). Males can guard up to 10 clutches per cycle and these may be deposited by multiple females (Kells <em>et al.</em> 2016). A male completes up to 3 breeding cycles per season (DeMartini 1976). Larvae hatch with an approximate total length of 0.6 cm and spend 1-3 months in the plankton before settling onto the reef surface (Wang 1986, DeMartini and Anderson 1980).<br/><br/><br/>Depending on population and sex, Painted Greenlings live up to 5-8 years and attain a maximum total length of 25.4 cm (DeMartini 1976, Orsi <em>et al.</em> 1991).

It has been recorded in open, sandy areas; however, it was associated with artificial structures where it found refuge (Hulberg and Graber 1980). Larvae and young juveniles are pelagic, while older juveniles settle on the bottom, and adults are sedentary and territorial (Marliave 1987). Despite being very territorial and having a strong homing instinct as adults, a juvenile of this species was recorded migrating 593 km between British Columbia and Washington. However, migrations and dispersal mechanisms are not well understood for this species (Miller 1982). Older juveniles and adults feed exclusively on hard shelled prey, such as sea urchins and <em>Cancer</em> crabs, but diet varies widely by locality, as locally abundant prey are preferred (Marliave 1987).<br/><br/>This species is serially monogamous and is thought to be able to establish new reproductive pairings within the same breeding season (Parra<em> et al.</em> 2001). In aquaria, pair bonding usually starts around 4 years of age. It deposits demersal adhesive eggs that are guarded by both parents: the female coils around the egg mass and the male coils around the female (Marliave 1987). Spawning usually occurs from October to February and appears to be timed with spring plankton blooms (Marliave 1987, Matarese <em>et al.</em> 1989). After being incubated for 3 - 4.5 months, larvae hatch at a standard length of 3.35 - 4.5 cm after mechanical stimulation of the eggs by the parents (Matarese <em>et al.</em> 1989, Griem and Martin 2000). Batch fecundity is estimated to be about 10,000 eggs and age at first maturity to be 4 years old (Marliave 1987).

Tomiyama&#160; pers. comm. 2021).</span><br/><br/><strong>China</strong>: This species is highly overexploited in Chinese waters. It is bred in captivity with 3 million fry released to the wild per year (Tian<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2016), but it is unknown whether these releases are improving the status of the species in Chinese waters.&#160;<br/><br/><strong>Korea</strong>: This species is naturally common&#160;off eastern Korea and&#160;is one of the six main flounder species in the commercial catch (Kwak and Park 2016). Major continuous declines in the Korean stock of this species have occurred due to overfishing. Korean flatfish fisheries have been overfished since at least the 1980s (Yoon&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2015). Hatchery-reared fish have been released to the wild since the early 2000s as part of an effort to enhance the resource. The broodstock supply for this hatchery is both wild-caught and captive-cultured, but mature individuals have become increasingly difficult to find in the wild, so the use of captive-cultured individuals has increased. This has led to poor genetic quality of the hatchery-reared stock&#160;(An <em>et al</em>. 2014). The impact of these releases on the status of the species in Korean waters is unknown.<br/><br/><strong>United States:</strong>&#160;This species is relatively common in Washington and Oregon (Pietsch and Orr 2015). In the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands, it is managed as part of the ""other flatfish complex"", which besides this species, primarily comprises Rex Sole (<em>Glyptocephalus zachirus</em>), Longhead Dab (<em>Myzopsetta proboscidea</em>), Dover Sole (<em>Microstomus pacificus</em>) and Butter Sole (<em>Isopsetta isolepis</em>).<strong>&#160;</strong>It is not targeted in this area but is retained as bycatch in fisheries that target&#160;other flatfish species and Pacific Cod. In recent years, the majority of the catch within the ""other flatfish complex"" is represented by Starry Flounder (<em>Platichthys stellatus</em>) and Rex Sole (<em>Glyptocephalus zachirus</em>). The exploitation rate of this species has been low since at least 1997. Stock biomass across the complex is currently at a relatively high level. Fishery-independent scientific surveys have been conducted annually in the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands since 1982. Survey biomass of this species in the eastern Bering Sea has mostly increased since 1982 with the exception of a decline after 2007 (98,623 t)&#160;punctuated by a peak value of 110,907 t&#160;in 2014 and return to decline in 2015 (56,190 t). Biomass remains at levels significantly higher than in the 1980s (Wilderbuer and Nichol 2015, 2018, 2019).&#160;<br/><br/>In the Gulf of Alaska, this species is managed as part of the ""shallow-water flatfish stock complex"", which besides this species, is primarily composed of Alaska Plaice (<em>Pleuronectes quadrituberculatus</em>), English Sole (<em>Parophrys vetulus</em>), Sand Sole (<em>Psettichthys melanostictus</em>), Butter Sole (<em>Isopsetta isolepis</em>), Yellowfin Sole (<em>Limanda aspera</em>), Northern Rock Sole (<em>Lepidopsetta polyxystra</em>) and Southern Rock Sole (<em>Lepidopsetta bilineata</em>). According to the most recent stock assessment, overfishing is not occurring and the exploitation rate on this complex is relatively low. According to scientific surveys, biomass of this species in the Gulf of Alaska from 1984 to 2019 fluctuated widely in some years, but overall, increased. Biomass peaked in 2001 at 76,418 t and had a secondary peak in 2007 at 73,039 t before declining by about 50% to values ranging between 39,757 to 23,446&#160;t from 2009 to 2019 (Turnock<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2017, Bryan 2019).",Stable,"This species<em>&#160;</em>is widely distributed in the North Pacific Ocean and adjacent Arctic Ocean (Mecklenburg <em>et al</em>. 2018). It occurs from the Yellow Sea (China) to the Sea of Japan, including the Korean Peninsula and Japan (throughout Hokkaido to Hiroshima), and off the Pacific coast of Japan from Hokkaido to Motoyama in Kochi. In Russian waters, it is found from Peter the Great Bay, Primorye to the northern Tatar Strait and off western Sakhalin Island, the Sea of Okhotsk, including the Amur, Tym and Poronai rivers, the southern and northern Kuril Islands and southeastern Kamchatka. It is found in the Bering Sea, Chukchi Sea, East Siberian Sea and Beaufort Sea (to Bathurst Inlet, Canada). It also occurs from the Gulf of Alaska south to Los Angeles Harbor, California, U.S. (Hart 1973; Sakamoto 1984; Lindberg and Fedorov 1993; Li and Wang 1995; Mecklenburg <em>et al</em>. 2002, 2018; Parin <em>et al</em>. 2014). The depth range is 1-600 metres (Nakabo 2013, Parin <em>et al</em>. 2014, Kells <em>et al.</em> 2016), but it typically occurs shallower than 100 m (Hart 1973, Mecklenburg <em>et al</em>. 2002).","This species is retained as bycatch in demersal fisheries in U.S. waters (Wilderbuer and Nichol 2015). It is commercially exploited in Russian waters, such as the Sea of Okhotsk and off Sakhalin Island. It is taken in fisheries in Japan (Wada&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2011), but it is not an esteemed species and commands a relatively low price (T. Tomiyama pers. comm. 2021).&#160;In Korea and China, it is highly valued and commercially important (Kwak and Park 2016, Tian<em> et al.</em> 2016); so much so, that with decreasing natural abundance, a large&#160;aquaculture industry has developed for this species (Tian<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2016, Jin&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2018).",Marine,"The subpopulation of this species in U.S. waters is closely monitored through scientific surveys and annual stock assessments. It is managed through the Bering Sea/Aleutian Islands Groundfish Fishery Management Plan and the Gulf of Alaska Groundfish Fishery Management Plan. Fishing is regulated through permitting, size limits, daily and total catch limits, seasonal and area fishing closures, gear restrictions, and a trawl catch share program. While it appears in commercial catches in Japan, it is regarded as a low-value species and is not targeted. In some parts of its range (e.g., China and Korea), attempts to augment natural subpopulations have been undertaken through releasing aquaculture-reared juveniles; however, the relative effectiveness of these releases in augmenting the wild stocks is undocumented, as are population genetic effects of these measures on the wild population are undocumented.","",,false,false,Global
160983555,41755,Physeter macrocephalus,Vulnerable,A1d,2019,2008-06-30 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The cause of the population reduction in this species (commercial whaling) is reversible, understood, and is not currently in operation. For this reason, the species is assessed under criterion A1, not under A2, A3 or A4. <em>Physeter macrocephalus</em> is globally widespread (thus not qualifying as threatened under criterion B), and does not have a global population that warrants listing under criteria C-D. Empirical trend data for this species globally are unavailable. However, commercial whaling at a large scale for this species in the North Pacific and Antarctic within the last three generations (82 years) certainly resulted in a global decline during this period. Commercial whaling for this species has ceased and therefore this population is evaluated under the A1 criterion rather than under the A2-4 criteria. A peer-reviewed publication (Whitehead 2002) provides a model-based estimate of global trend that can be used to evaluate the population under the A1 criterion. The results from that study gave a 6% probability for Endangered, a 54% probability of meeting the Vulnerable category, and a 40% probability of falling into the Near Threatened category. The results suggest little chance that the population would meet the criteria for Endangered or for Least Concern. There is credible and realistic evidence for either the Vulnerable or Near Threatened category. Given that the results give greater probability for at least the Vulnerable category (60%), and that this is the more precautionary category, the species is classified as Vulnerable.","The habitat of the Sperm Whale is the open sea. More specifically, Sperm Whales can be found in almost all marine waters deeper than 1,000 m that are not covered by ice, except in the Black Sea and possibly the Red Sea (Rice 1989; Whitehead 2003). In some areas, particularly in the western North Atlantic, sperm whales, especially males, can occur in shallower waters (e.g., Scott and Sadove 1997). Females and young are usually restricted to waters at latitudes lower than about 40-50º and to areas where sea surface temperatures are greater than about 15ºC (Rice 1989). Sperm Whales are generally more numerous in areas of relatively high primary productivity (Jaquet <em>et al</em>. 1996), although there are some exceptions, such as the Sargasso Sea and the central North Pacific gyre (Barlow and Taylor 2005).<br/><br/>The Sperm Whale is an animal of extremes in size (up to 18 m), sexual dimorphism (mature males have three times the mass of mature females), ecological imprint (sperm whales take roughly the same amount of biomass from the oceans as humans), and many other attributes (Whitehead 2003). The commercial value of the animal (a function of its size and the quality of Sperm Whale oil) drove two massive worldwide hunts: the technologically primitive “open-boat” hunt from 1712-~1920 (Starbuck 1878; Best 1983), and modern whaling using engine-driven whaling ships and harpoon guns from ~1910-1988 (Tonnessen and Johnsen 1982). The complex social structure of sperm whales may have been affected by whaling, lowering potential population growth rates, which are very low anyway (Whitehead 2003). On the positive side, Sperm Whales are very widely distributed (see above), and their primary prey, deep-water squid, are not yet major targets of fisheries.<br/><br/>The generation time (mean age of mothers) for Sperm Whales can be calculated if one assumes a set of population parameters, specifically age at first birth, mortality rate of mature females, and reproductive rate of mature females. There is uncertainty about these parameters, so two calculations were made using different assumptions:<br/><br/>a) Applying the population parameters most recently used for Sperm Whales by the International Whaling Commission’s Scientific Committee (International Whaling Commission 1982): age at first birth = 10 years; female reproductive rate in unexploited population = 0.20/year; female adult mortality = 0.055/yr): generation time = 27.3 years.<br/><br/>b) The estimates of mortality used by the International Whaling Commission are particularly problematic, and Sperm Whales likely have age-specific survival and reproductive rates. Thus it may be more realistic (Whitehead 2002) to use the well-established mortality schedule of Killer Whales (<em>Orcinus orca</em>; Olesiuk <em>et al</em>. 1990) and an age-specific pregnancy rate taken from the sperm whale data presented by Best <em>et al</em>. (1984; pregnancy rate for mature females = 0.257-0.0038xAge in years): generation time = 27.5","The greatest threat to Sperm Whales, extensive commercial whaling, has ceased. However, a number of other threats of various dimensions remain.<br/><br/>Sperm Whales have had a long history of local whaling going back at least to the 1500s and intense commercial whaling beginning around 1712 and continuing to 1988. The “modern” highly mechanised phase was particularly intense around 1950, and at its peak killed around 25,000 whales per year, dramatically depleting the global population. In recent decades, some tens of whales were taken each year from small boats in Indonesia (Reeves 2002), although none have been taken in the last two years (H. Whitehead pers. comm.), and 10 are taken annually by Japan under IWC Special Permit (Clapham <em>et al</em>. 2003).<br/><br/>Entanglement in fishing gear, particularly gillnets, has been a particular problem in the Mediterranean Sea (Reeves and Notarbartolo di Sciara, 2006), but Sperm Whales die from entanglement in nets and lines in many other areas and in a variety of fisheries as well (e.g., Haase and Félix 1994; Barlow and Cameron 2003). Considering the widespread distribution of Sperm Whales, observations of occasional takes in relatively small scale gillnet fisheries (e.g. Barlow and Cameron 2003) suggest much larger takes in unobserved, unregulated high seas driftnet fisheries such as were common before the 1989 adoption of resolution 44/225 of the UN General Assembly. <br/><br/>Sperm Whales sometimes take fish off fishing gear (most often demersal long-line gear), an activity known as “depredation.” Depredation of long-line catches appears to be a recent and increasing phenomenon, and now occurs in many regions (e.g., South East Alaska, Chile, South Georgia and several other southern ocean island areas, North Atlantic). This interaction has resulted in a few reported entanglements and deaths (e.g. Salas 1987; Hucke-Gaete <em>et al</em>. 2004), and has incurred hostility from some fishermen (National Marine Fisheries Service 1998; Donoghue <em>et al</em>. 2003), including shooting of whales (González and Olivarría 2002).<br/><br/>Sperm Whale tissues have high levels of some contaminants (O'Shea 1999; Nielsen <em>et al</em>. 2000); however, any population-level effects on health are unknown. The effects of noise on Sperm Whales are also uncertain. Some evidence suggests that they are highly sensitive to noise (e.g., Watkins <em>et al</em>. 1985; Bowles <em>et al</em>. 1994) while other studies have found little or no effect (e.g., Madsen and Møhl 2000; Madsen <em>et al</em>. 2002). To date, all published studies of Sperm Whales and noise focus on short-term behavioural effects. Avoidance of sonar (Dawson pers. comm.) and seismic surveys (Mate <em>et al</em>. 1994; but see Madsen <em>et al</em>. 2002) has been observed but no mortality has been documented.<br/><br/>Whaling on Sperm Whales has at various times focussed almost exclusively on one sex or the other. Removals of large numbers of males may have had lingering effects on pregnancy rates in some subpopulations (Best 1979; Clarke <em>et al</em>. 1980; Whitehead <em>et al</em>. 1997) and large males are noticeably uncommon on some breeding grounds (Whitehead 2003). The removal of large numbers of females from social groups, and of older females in particular, may have lingering, socially disruptive effects. Furthermore, recovery might be inhibited via temporary or permanent loss of social cohesion and of socio-ecological knowledge such as is known to occur in other large-brained, long-lived social mammals (e.g., elephants, Poole and Thomsen 1989). <br/><br/>Maximum rates of increase for Sperm Whale populations are very low, possibly on the order of 1% per year (Whitehead 2002). Population growth/recovery can be expected to be low in the species.<br/><br/>Sperm Whales face other threats at a more regional level. These include collisions with ships (Laist <em>et al</em>. 2001), for instance off the Canary Islands (André and Potter 2000) and in the Mediterranean (Pesante <em>et al</em>. 2002), and ingestion of marine debris in the Mediterranean (e.g., Viale <em>et al</em>. 1992). <br/><br/>Causes for optimism: On the one hand, the Sperm Whale is not being heavily whaled at present and seems relatively secure from this threat in the short and medium term. When not being actively hunted, the Sperm Whale has rather little interaction with humans: most of its habitat is far from land, and few of its food sources (principally deep-water squid) are of currently harvested (Clarke 1977). Some populations, for instance the animals in the western North Atlantic that were little affected by modern whaling, seem healthy with reasonably high population densities and evidence of satisfactory reproduction (Gordon <em>et al</em>. 1998; National Marine Fisheries Service 2000).<br/><br/>Causes for concern: on the other hand, the Sperm Whale, with a maximum rate of increase of around 1% per year (Whitehead 2002), is not well adapted to recover from population depletion. Furthermore, the population model considers only one anthropogenic threat, whaling, and thus posits that the Sperm Whale population has recovered since about 1980 (Fig. 1 in linked PDF document), when large-scale commercial whaling was rapidly coming to an end. This recovery is purely theoretical, and may not be occurring as sperm whales carry high levels of some chemical contaminants (O'Shea 1999; Nielsen <em>et al</em>. 2000), ocean noise is increasing (Gordon and Moscrop 1996), interactions with fisheries continue to result in sperm whale deaths (International Whaling Commission 1994), and the lingering, socially disruptive effects of whaling may be inhibiting recovery of this highly social species (Whitehead <em>et al</em>. 1997). Some regional populations of sperm whales are declining or are apparently not recovering from depletion. Even in the absence of whaling, the Mediterranean population appears to have declined over the past 20 years, with bycatch in driftnets a likely principal cause (Reeves and Notarbartolo di Sciara 2006). The southeastern Pacific Sperm Whale population, very heavily whaled during the period 1950-1980, has an extremely low recruitment rate (probably below replacement), perhaps because of the social disruption caused by intense whaling (Whitehead <em>et al</em>. 1997). The population of mature and maturing males in the Antarctic was also heavily whaled over the same period, but should have repopulated from less heavily exploited breeding populations at lower latitudes following the end of large-scale commercial whaling. However, systematic surveys of Sperm Whales in the Antarctic showed no substantial or statistically significant increase between 1978 and 1992 (Branch and Butterworth 2001).","The only recent quantitative analysis of sperm whale population trends (Whitehead 2002; Fig. 1 in supplementary material, which constitutes an integral part of this assessment) suggests that a pre-whaling global population of about 1,100,000 had been reduced by about 29% by 1880 through “open-boat” whaling, and then to approximately 360,000 (67% reduction from initial) by the 1990s through modern whaling, although much uncertainty is associated with all these estimates (Fig. 1 in supplementary material). There is no direct evidence that any part of the population has increased since the end of large-scale whaling in about 1980, although for most areas there is also no direct evidence that they have not. In some areas there is concern that populations are continuing to decline (see below).<br/><br/>The species has a huge geographic range (Rice 1989) and a global population size in the 100,000's (Whitehead 2002; Fig 1). Although there is considerable uncertainty about sperm whale population parameters and levels of exploitation, Whitehead (2002) estimated historical trajectories of sperm whale abundance incorporating many, but not all, sources of uncertainty (Fig. 1 in supplementary material). That model was modified slightly (to produce an endpoint in 2003) and run to estimate the decline in global sperm whale population size between 1921 and 2003 (i.e. over approximately 3 generations; 82yr; see below for estimation of generation time) (H. Whitehead pers. comm.). As sperm whale population size seems to have changed rather little between about 1910-1930 (Whitehead 2002; Fig. 1 in supplementary material), the calculations are probably quite robust with reference to the estimated generation time. Using the “best” estimates of the model parameters (as in Whitehead 2002), the population in 2003 would have been 44% of that in 1921. Of 1,000 runs using model parameters randomly selected from within reasonable ranges (as in Whitehead 2002), 6% gave populations in 2003 of &lt;30% of that in 1922, 54% gave a 2003 population between 30-50% of that in 1992, and 40% suggested depletion levels of less than 50% over this time.<br/><br/> Arguments can be made that the model results are overly optimistic or overly pessimistic. Factors that would contribute to making the results overly optimistic that are not accounted for in the model include not accounting for under-reporting of illegal Soviet catches in the North Pacific and Antarctica and under-reporting of Japanese catches in the North Pacific (Kasuya and Brownell 2001), other continuing threats (described below), and factors such as continuing effects of social disruption from whaling that might inhibit recovery (consistent with an apparent lack of recovery in many areas). Factors that would contribute to making the results overly pessimistic include the assumption of a relatively low rate of increase in the model and the extrapolation of a relatively high estimate of g(0) (the proportion of whales detected on the trackline) from a single study to the global population. The direction of the effect of other uncertainties in model inputs, including the effects of sex-biased catches, is not certain. Despite these uncertainties, the Whitehead model provides the best available scientific evidence upon which to base this assessment. To reduce these uncertainties, future analyses would need to address the concerns identified above. <br/><br/>Efforts to assess the conservation status of sperm whales and the impact of historical whaling on contemporary structure are compromised by the absence of a good model of sperm whale population structure; pooling data may obscure distinct geographic patterns. While Sperm Whales are known to show long distance movements (Ivashin and Rovnin 1967; Mitchell 1975) and low genetic differentiation among ocean basins, several lines of evidence suggest that sperm whales past and present, have significant geographic structure. Analyses based on historical and contemporary data from tagging records (Rice 1974; Kasuya and Miyashita 1988), blood types (Fujino 1963), catch distributions, sighting patterns, size composition, lack of recovery from exploitation (Japan), timing of pregnancy (Best <em>et al</em>.1984), photo-identification (Whitehead 2003), genetics (Drouot 2004; Mesnick <em>et al</em>. 1999), cultural markers (Rendell and Whitehead 2003) and combinations thereof (Bannister and Mitchell 1980; Kasuya and Miyashita 1988) suggest evidence for structure in many regions. Over the past decade, several authors have investigated population structure in female Sperm Whales using sequence variation within the mitochondrial control region DNA (mtDNA) and/or polymorphic nuclear loci (microsatellites). In general, results tend to find low genetic differentiation among ocean basins and little evidence of subdivision within ocean basins, with the exception of some isolated basins such as the Mediterranean and Gulf of Mexico (Lyrholm <em>et al</em>. 1999; Mesnick <em>et al</em>. 1999; Drouot <em>et al</em>. 2004). However, factors such as low sample sizes, low mtDNA haplotypic diversity and social structure alone and together reduce the power to detect population structure. In addition, it is clear that biologically discrete populations of odontocetes can occur independently of strong geographic or oceanographic features. Alternative, non-geographic based hypotheses of population structure, such as dialect and differences in diet such as are found in Killer Whales, have not been thoroughly examined. For example, Rendell and Whitehead (2003) suggest that female populations seem to be culturally structured within oceans by “coda” vocalizations and may be genetically distinct (Rendell and Whitehead 2005, Rendell <em>et al</em>. 2005).",Unknown,"The Sperm Whale has a large geographic range (Rice 1989). It can be seen in nearly all marine regions, from the equator to high latitudes, but is generally found in continental slope or deeper water. The distribution extends to many enclosed or partially-enclosed seas, such as the Mediterranean Sea, Sea of Okhotsk, Gulf of California, and Gulf of Mexico.",The large-scale commercial harvesting of this species has ceased. Small-scales fisheries continue in Japan and Indonesia.,Marine,"The species is on Appendix I of CITES and Appendices I and II of CMS.<br/><br/>Management plans need both development and implementation.

However, no scheme for managing Sperm Whale populations is in place. Moreover, many range states are not members of the International Whaling Commission.<br/><br/>Regional subpopulations of Sperm Whales exist, and there has been an apparent lack of recovery in some areas or even continued decline (e.g., the Mediterranean (Reeves and Notarbartolo di Sciara 2006).

Based on the average rate of decline of spawning stock biomass (SSB) from 1952 to 2018, applied over the past 3 generation lengths, or 29–42 years, this species is estimated to have declined between 17 and 24%. The latest estimate of SSB for this species is estimated to be less than 5% of original biomass. The stock is overfished and overfishing is occurring. Therefore, this species is listed as Near Threatened under Criterion A2.</p>","The Pacific Bluefin Tuna is epipelagic and usually oceanic, but seasonally comes close to the shore. It is found from the surface to depths of at least 550 m and tolerates wide temperature ranges.&#160; It spends the majority of its time in the upper mixed layer, but makes frequent dives to below the thermocline. Pacific Bluefin Tuna school by size, sometimes with in mixed species schools with other scombrids. Some juvenile Pacific Bluefin Tuna undertake trans-Pacific migrations from nursery areas in the western Pacific into the eastern Pacific, spending up to four years before returning to the western Pacific to spawn (Bayliff 1994). It was originally thought that the proportion of Pacific Bluefin Tuna that underwent this migration was relatively small, but recent research using intrinsic tracers in tissues suggests that in some years it likely that a much larger proportion of the population does this (Madigan 2015, Madigan <em>et al</em>. 2017, Collette and Graves 2019). Recent studies in the western and eastern Pacific using electronic archival tags have documented the tracks and timelines of transpacific and regional migrations (Kitagawa <em>et al</em>. 2009, Boustany <em>et al</em>. 2010). It has been theorized that Pacific Bluefin, Atlantic Bluefin and Southern Bluefin move to small, strongly convergent segments of energetically forced eddy structures, which although unproductive, allow spawning schools of sufficient size to generate sufficient numbers of larvae (Bakun 2013). This strategy may circumvent resident predator pits while exerting sufficient predatory loss on resident predators to facilitate this circumvention, and thus is an important consideration in management of spawning areas.<br/><br/>The Pacific Bluefin Tuna&#160; is a voracious predator that feeds on a wide variety of small schooling fishes and squid, and also eats crabs and other less sessile organisms (Collette and Graves 2019). Larvae (2.3–14.6 mm TL) feed during the day on small zooplankton including copepods, cladocerans, and appendicularians (Uotani <em>et al</em>. 1990, Kodama <em>et al</em>. 2017). In the Tsushima Current region (Sea of Japan), small Pacific Bluefin Tuna (20–25 cm FL) preyed upon small squid while larger fish (25-35 cm FL) gradually shifted their diet to mesopelagic fishes (Shimose <em>et al</em>. 2013). In the Kuroshio region of the north western Pacific, small Pacific Bluefin Tuna preyed mostly on small zooplankton (crustacean larvae) and larger individuals shifted to epipelagic clupeoid fishes such as sardines and anchovies. In the eastern Pacific, juvenile Pacific Bluefin Tuna feed primarily on fishes, which constitute 93% of gut contents by volume, but they also eat small quantities of crustaceans and squids (Pinkas 1971, Collette and Graves 2019). <br/><br/>Pacific Bluefin Tuna are known to spawn in only two areas of the western North Pacific: from the Philippine Islands north to the Ryuku Islands from April to June and further north in the Sea of Japan from June to August (Yabe <em>et al</em>. 1966, Ueyanagi 1969, Ohshimo <em>et al</em>. 2017). The distribution of sizes of fish on the two spawning grounds differs, with larger fish (modal size 220 cm FL) spawning on the southern grounds and smaller fish (modal size 150 cm FL) spawning in Sea of Japan. The difference in size distributions results in a difference in estimated age at 50% maturity: age 11 for the southern grounds, and age 4 for the northern grounds (Huff 2017, Collette and Graves 2019). Previously, Tanaka (2006) estimated that the size at first maturity is 100–150 cm FL (50–60 kg) at an age of approximately 3 to 5 years. The fraction of females in spawning condition increases steadily on the spawning grounds through the spawning season, as females leave the area immediately after spawning ceases (Shimose <em>et al</em>. 2018). The sex ratio is about 1:1. Females are batch spawners and can spawn almost every day with an average batch fecundity of 6.4 million oocytes (Okochi <em>et al</em>. 2016). Batch fecundity increases with length, from about five million eggs at 190 cm FL to about 25 million eggs at 240 cm FL (Schaefer 2001, Sawada <em>et al</em>. 2005, Chen <em>et al</em>. 2006, Collette and Graves 2019). Larvae have been shown to react to biological (e.g. food, predation) and physical conditions (e.g. sea temperature, sea flow) during early life history stages (Satoh 2010; Satoh <em>et al</em>. 2008, 2013). The life cycle of the Pacific Bluefin Tuna has been completed under aquaculture conditions, the first for a large species of tuna (Sawada <em>et al</em>. 2005).<br/><br/>While most Pacific Bluefin Tuna caught off California are in the 5–25 kg weight range, fish as large as 457.7 kg and 271.2 cm FL, have been caught off the Channel Islands during the winter months. The largest Pacific Bluefin Tuna recorded by the Far Seas Fisheries Research Laboratory, Shimizu, Japan weighed approximately&#160; 555 kg and was about 3 m long (Foreman and Ishizuka 1990). It was caught about 300 miles south of Kyushu Island, Japan in April 1986 (Collette and Graves 2019). The IGFA all-tackle game fish record is of a 411.6 kg fish caught off Three Kings Islands, northern New Zealand in February 2014 (IGFA 2020). Growth is most rapid in the first few years of life and asymptotic length is reached at an age of approximately 20 years or older (Murua <em>et al</em>. 2017). Longevity is at least 26 years based on a 260 cm FL fish (Shimose <em>et al</em>. 2009). As with the other two species of bluefin tunas, males tend to grow larger than females.<br/><br/>Based on maturity and longevity studies (Collette <em>et al</em>. 2011), the generation length was previously estimated to be between 7–9 years (Collette and Graves 2019), based on the age class data including maximum age, natural mortality and maturity estimates of Pacific Bluefin Tuna used in the 2014 ISC stock assessment (ISC 2014). According to the ISC 2014 assessment, a maximum age of 20 years was modelled and used as an accumulator for all older ages. It was estimated that only 0.15% of the unfished cohort remains by the age of 20 years. Moreover, the assessment used an age at 50% maturity of 4 years and an age of 100% maturity of 5 years. Natural mortality was also age-specific, as 1.6 at age 0, 0.38 at age 1, and 0.25 from age 2 to 20 years.<br/><br/>However, generation length is likely at least 9.5 years, based on age of first maturity and longevity parameters used in the SA and VB in the most recent stock assessment (e.g. 20% at 3 years, 50% at 4 years, 100% at 5 years, with a longevity of 26 years). Although even these parameters may be highly underestimated (A. Boustany, pers. comm., July 2020), and Goodyear (1995) reports a generation length range between 12 and 14 years. To accommodate this uncertainty, generation length is currently estimated to be between 9.5 and 14 years, corresponding to a three generation length time period of 29 to 42 years.","Purse seines are the dominant gear type, accounting for about two-thirds of the catch, while coastal set nets, trolling and pelagic longlines account for most of the reminder. Japan is responsible for the majority of the landings in the western Pacific, with some catch by Taiwan and Korea. The United States was responsible for the largest catches in the eastern Pacific through the late 1970s, fishing in waters off Baja California.&#160; However, U.S. effort and landings decreased when Mexico established its exclusive economic zone in 1976. Mexico has accounted for the majority of eastern Pacific landings since the mid-1980s and a significant fraction of the purse seine catch of juvenile fish is transported to coastal pens for fattening (Collette and Graves 2019).<br/><br/>The price of the first big bluefin brought into what was formerly the Tokyo Tsukiji market, an annual event intended to generate publicity, has substantially increased each year: $396,000, 341 kg (2011), $735,000, 269 kg (2012), $1,800,000, 222 kg (2013). In 2019, a 278 kg bluefin sold for $3,100,000 (BBC 2019). However, the extent to which the increasing value of this species is an indicator of the increasing fishery pressure on this species is unclear without knowledge of Japanese ex-vessel prices for the Pacific bluefin (J. Graves, pers. comm. August 2020). However, the fishery's end value was estimated to be worth more than $800,000 million in 2018 (Pew 2020).<br/><p></p>","Pacific Bluefin Tuna comprise a single, pan-Pacific population, with no significant genetic differentiation between samples from Japan and Mexico (Nomura <em>et al</em>. 2014) or from Taiwan and New Zealand (Tseng and Smith 2012). Multiple lines of evidence demonstrate significant movement of juvenile and adults from the western North Pacific to the eastern North Pacific, with adults returning to the western North Pacific for spawning (Madigan <em>et al</em>. 2017).<br/><br/>Most of the catch of this species is from the western Pacific Ocean, with 20–30% occurring in the eastern Pacific (Collette and Graves 2019). FAO worldwide reported landings show a sharp increase from 1,452 mt in 1950 to 40,094 mt in 1956, as the purse seine fishery developed. Landings remained high (25,000–40,000 mt) for the next ten years. Since that time, landings have shown considerable variation, likely resulting from fluctuations in recruitment, with highs approaching the levels of the 1960s to a low of 8,797 mt in 1990.&#160; Landings for the past several years have averaged around 14,000 mt (Collette and Graves 2019). The total Pacific Bluefin Tuna catch by members of the International Scientific Committee for Tuna and Tuna-like Species in the North Pacific Ocean (ISC) was 10,177 mt in 2018 and 10,940 in 2019, a 25% decrease from the 2013–2017 average (WCPFC 2019). The ISC is responsible for conducting regular stock assessments for the Pacific Bluefin Tuna, and created the Pacific Bluefin Tuna Working Group (PBFWG) in 1996 with the task to assemble, conduct and analyse fisheries statistics, biological studies and stock assessments for Pacific Bluefin Tuna. The Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission (WCPFC) and the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission (IATTC) are jointly in charge of the management of Pacific Bluefin Tuna, and use the ISC stock assessment determination and advice to establish conservation and management measures.<br/><br/>The base case results from the latest stock assessment (ISC 2020) show that spawning stock biomass (SSB) has fluctuated throughout the assessment period (1952–2018), declined steadily from 1996 to 2010, and increased slowly from 2011 to 2018. The estimated biomass trend for the last 30 years is robust, but SSB prior to the 1980s is uncertain due to data limitations. The 2018 SSB is estimated at 25,228 mt. Historical recruitment estimates have fluctuated since 1952, with no clear trend. The 2016 recruitment estimate (~17 million fish) exceeds the historical average (~13 million fish), but the recent 2018 estimate, which is based on fewer observations and is more uncertain, assessed around 4 million fish, about 35% of the average.<br/><br/>The WCPFC adopted an initial biomass rebuilding target (the median SSB estimated for the period 1952 through 2014, SSB<sub>MED</sub>), and a second biomass rebuilding target (20%SSBF=0 under average recruitment), without giving a specific fishing mortality reference level. SSB<sub>MED</sub> was estimated in the stock assessment to be 6.7%SSB<sub>F</sub>=0 and the corresponding fishing mortality expressed as SPR of F6.7%SPR. SPR is the ratio of the cumulative spawning biomass that an average recruit is expected to produce over its lifetime when the stock is fished at the current intensity to the cumulative biomass that could be produced by an average recruit over its lifetime if the stock was unfished. Due to the projections including catch limits, fishing mortality is expected to decline. In other words, Fx%SPR will increase as biomass increases. The point estimate of the SSB<sub>2016</sub> was 3.3%SSB<sub>F</sub>=0 and the fishing mortality for 2016 corresponds to F6.7%SPR (WCPFC 2019). According to ISSF (2020), Pacific Bluefin Tuna is heavily overfished and is rebuilding slowly. The ISC did not estimate SSB relative to SSB<sub>MSY</sub> or F relative to F<sub>MSY</sub>. However, estimated SSB is 4.5% of the unfished level and at or close to the historical minimum. F is substantially higher than some indicators used as proxies for F<sub>MSY</sub> (ISSF 2020b).<br/><br/>Estimated population decline for this species was calculated over two different three generation length timeframes of 29 and 42 years (given that generation length may range between 9.5 and 14 years). As estimated SSB for this species has fluctuated substantially since 1952 (ISC 2020), two methods were used to estimate the change in SSB over the past 29–42 years. In the first method, linear percent change in SSB over the different time periods (1989-2018; 1976-2018) was calculated using 3-year averages for SSB endpoints. Given the extreme non-linear fluctuation in estimated SSB, this yielded a 45% increase in SSB between 1989–2018, and a 6% decrease in SSB between 1976–2018. In a second, preferred method more applicable for non-linear fluctuations, the average annual percent change in SSB across the entire time series (1952–2018) was calculated and then used to estimate the population change over the last 29 to 42 years, assuming an exponential pattern of decline. Based on this preferred method, this species is estimated to have declined by 17 to 24% over the past 29 to 42 years respectively.",Decreasing,"The Pacific Bluefin Tuna is present throughout the Pacific Ocean and enters the eastern Indian Ocean. In the eastern Pacific, it is found from the Gulf of Alaska to southern California and Baja California, Mexico. In the western Pacific, it is known from Sakhalin Island in the southern Sea of Okhotsk south to the northern Philippines. Although basically a temperate species, it also ventures into tropical waters south to French Polynesia and New Zealand, but there is no evidence of spawning in these areas (Collette and Graves 2019). Spawning has only been reported in the western North Pacific Ocean (Bayliff 1994, Chen <em>et al</em>. 2006, Tanaka <em>et al</em>. 2007).","The Pacific Bluefin Tuna is a high-value species in the global fresh-fish markets, particularly in the sashimi and sushi markets of Japan, and aquaculture production is being intensively studied in Japan.&#160;It is the most expensive fish in the world (Collette and Graves 2019). It is important to note that aquaculture production has now spread to Mexico, where the total production may now exceed wild catch.",Marine,"In the most recent stock assessment, WCPFC was advised to note the current very low level of spawning biomass, the current level of overfishing, and the strong influence on the projections of the inclusion of a relatively high but uncertain recruitment in 2016. A precautionary approach to the management of Pacific Bluefin Tuna was recommended by most CCMs, particularly with regard to the timing of increasing catch levels, until the stock has been rebuilt to higher biomass levels.<br/><br/>It was also noted that the projection based on the base-case model representing the current WCPFC (CMM 2017-09) and IATTC (C-16-08) management measures under the low recruitment scenario gave a 98% probability of achieving the initial biomass rebuilding target by 2024. This estimated probability exceeds the threshold of 75% or above in 2024 set by the WCPFC Harvest Strategy (Harvest Strategy 2017-02). In the latter strategy, recruitment should switch from the low recruitment scenario to the average recruitment scenario the year after the initial rebuilding target is achieved, although there is no evidence to suggest that recruitment will increase at that point. The probability of achieving the second biomass rebuilding target (20%SSBF=0) 10 years after the first target is achieved or by 2034, whichever comes first, is estimated to be 96% under average recruitment but only 3% under low recruitment. Only the 96% level exceeds the threshold set by the strategy.<br/><br/>The WCPFC Harvest Strategy informed by the ISC projections aims to: (1) provide catch reduction options if the projection results indicate the initial rebuilding target will not be met; or (2) provide relevant information for optional increase in catch if the initial rebuilding target is likely to be achieved with greater than 75% probability. Based on the projection results, the probability of achieving the initial rebuilding target exceeded the level prescribed in the strategy and, thus, some optional scenarios with higher catch limits were provided&#160; (WCPFC 2019).<br/><p></p>","",,false,false,Global

It can be very abundant where suitable habitat is found. It is not targeted, but is taken in multispecies demersal trawl fisheries in some areas. Species-specific population and landings data are not available, but reported landings of <em>Citharichthys </em>spp. in California have declined in recent years. This small-sized species is exploited to some degree and occurs as bycatch; but it remains very abundant in appropriate habitats. Therefore, it is listed as Least Concern. To improve the quality of future assessments, the level of impact of exploitation and dependence on shallow-water environments needs further study.","This demersal species inhabits muddy, sandy, and rocky substrates of tidepools, lagoons, estuaries, bays, and on the continental shelf (Moring 1986, Rackowski and Pikitch 1989, Mecklenburg <em>et al</em>. 2002, Mendoza <em>et al</em>. 2009, Robertson and Allen 2015). Adults are not highly migratory, but movements are influenced by prey availability, seasonal temperature changes, and substrate (Rackowski and Pikitch 1989, and references therein).<br/><br/>Diets of Speckled Sanddabs are diverse and vary with size (Ford 1965, Rackowski and Pikitch 1989). Juveniles (&lt; 75 mm) typically consume copepods, amphipods, cumaceans, and mysids, whereas adults (&gt; 76 mm) primarily consume larger decapods, molluscs, and small fishes (Ford 1965, Ambrose 1976, Rackowski and Pikitch 1989).&#160;<br/><br/>Mature individuals appear to congregate for spawning (e.g., at La Jolla Canyon: Ford 1965). Spawning occurs near bottom in bays and in the open ocean; along southern California, fishes spawn&#160;typically from April to September (Ford 1965, Goldberg and Pham 1987, Rackowski and Pikitch 1989). The spawning season for other localities varies depending on temperature.&#160;<br/><br/>Females reach sexual maturity at 2 years at sizes of 70-80 mm total length (Ford 1965, Rackowski and Pikitch 1989). Small females (50.0-67.5 mm total length) contained only small, immature eggs. Larger females (78 mm total length) have larger, mature or maturing, eggs (Ford 1965, Rackowski and Pikitch 1989). The number of eggs spawned per season increases with size of the spawning female: fecundity of smaller females (85.0-90.5 mm) was estimated at 4,200 eggs, whereas that of larger females (greater than 129.0 mm) was estimated at 22,500 eggs (Ford 1965). During the spawning season, many individuals (males and females) retained much of their gonadal mass, indicating multiple spawning events, with small numbers of sperm and eggs released per spawning event&#160;throughout the spawning season (Ford 1965, Rackowski and Pikitch 1989).&#160;<br/><br/>Females grow faster and attain larger sizes than males (Ford 1965, Chamberlain 1979,&#160;Rackowski and Pikitch 1989). Maximum longevity has been reported at 3-4 years (Arora 1951, Ford 1965, Rackowski and Pikitch 1989). The maximum size is 19 cm total length (Robertson and Allen 2015), but it rarely attains sizes larger than 13 cm total length (Mecklenburg <em>et al</em>. 2002).","This species may be negatively affected by overexploitation in parts of its range, as indicated by recent declines in aggregated landings of <em>Citharichthys </em>spp. in California (California Department of Fish and Wildlife 2019). The actual amounts of this species in demersal fisheries is not quantified. However, it is estimated that less than 2% of the landings of mixed species of <em>Citharichthys </em>contains individuals of this species. It also occurs in nearshore habitats that may be negatively impacted by anthropogenic activities occurring in these areas; however, the degree to which this species depends on these sensitive habitats is not well known.","Population data are limited. It can be very abundant within its range (Miller and Lea 1972, Piestch and Orr 2015). Although taken with other species of <em>Citharichthys </em>in recreational and demersal trawl fisheries, it contributes only minor amounts to these catches (He <em>et al</em>. 2013).",Unknown,"This species is distributed in the eastern Pacific Ocean from Prince William Sound, Alaska, USA to Magdalena Bay and Almejas Bay, Baja California Sur, Mexico and in the Gulf of California in Concepcion Bay, Baja California Sur, Mexico (Miller and Lea 1972, Hart 1973, Rackowski and Pikitch 1989, Hensley 1995, Mecklenburg&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2002, van der Heiden <em>et al</em>. 2009, Robertson and Allen 2015, Pietsch and Orr 2015, Kells <em>et al</em>. 2016). It is listed in a checklist of fishes of Ecuador (Bearez 1996) and included in a key to the fishes of Peru (Chirichigno and Vélez 1998), but these records are not based on verified specimens (T.A. Munroe pers. comm. 2021). Its depth range is 3-366 m (Miller and Lea 1972, Mecklenburg <em>et al</em>. 2002); however, it is usually found in less than 100 m (Mecklenburg&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2002, van der Heiden <em>et al</em>. 2009, Robertson and Allen 2015).","This species is not commercially targeted. It is taken in recreational fisheries, along with other species of <em>Citharichthys</em>. It is also taken as bycatch in demersal trawl fisheries, where, because of its small size, it is usually discarded at sea or, when landed, ground into fishmeal (Eschmeyer&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1983, Rackowski and Pikitch 1989).",Marine,"The landings of Speckled Sanddab are controlled by a variety of federal and state management measures, including gear restrictions, size and bag limits, area and seasonal closures, and discard regulations (see detailed discussion of fisheries management activities, focused on the larger-sized species, Pacific Sanddab, but also likely to influence Speckled Sanddab, in He&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2013).

Within this broad range, populations appear to be patchily distributed and the global population size is unknown. The species has a conservative life history, producing only one pup on average every 1–3 years and likely has a very low intrinsic rate of population increase. The Spinetail Devil Ray is a large component of targeted fisheries and a bycatch of many small- and large-scale fisheries, with much of this catch unreported or aggregated as <em>Mobula </em>species. The depths and regions used by the Spinetail Devil Ray coincide with many artisanal and industrial fisheries raising concerns about previously unreported and continued bycatch. Steep population declines are evident in the Indian and Pacific Oceans, including India and Indonesia. The lack of species-specific catch records, fishing effort, and population data necessitates the use of genus-wide inferences to assess some population reductions, however notable declines in landings of 50–96% over 15 years have been documented in Indonesia, and extinction is suspected in areas with intense and growing fishing pressure. The Spinetail Devil Ray has a widespread global range and in some parts of its distribution such as Australia, New Zealand and some Pacific countries, the threat would likely be far less than elsewhere due to lower fishing pressure and strong fisheries management. The Spinetail Devil Ray is used locally and sometimes nationally, and often traded internationally, with the rise of the valuable gill plate trade increasing pressure on the species. Unlike for some of the other mobulid species, the development of localized marine protected areas is unlikely to provide this species any significant protection from fisheries due to its large-scale movements.&#160;Based on actual levels of exploitation, steep declining population trends, a conservative life history, and the increasing trade demand, a global population reduction of 50–79% over the past three generation lengths (38 years) is suspected, with a further population reduction suspected over the next three generation lengths (2018–2056). The Spinetail Devil Ray is therefore assessed as Endangered (A2bd+3d).</p></span></span>","<span lang=""en-GB"">  <p>  </p><p>The Spinetail Devil Ray&#160;is a pelagic species that resides in coastal and continental shelf waters.

The species exhibits large-scale movements, up to 1,800 km at minimum speeds of 63 km per day likely driven by seasonal patterns in prey availability  (Freund <em>et al. </em>2000, Canese <em>et al.</em> 2011, Croll <em>et al.</em> 2012, Francis and Jones 2017). <span lang=""en-GB"">The species reaches a maximum size of 350 cm DW (Notarbartolo di Sciara <em>et al. </em>2020), with significant geographical variation in size across its  distribution.

These rays are captured in a wide range of gear types including harpoons, drift nets, purse seine nets, gillnets, traps, trawls, and longlines.

Despite a broad worldwide distribution, populations appear to be patchily distributed. Abundance also appears to vary substantially and may be based on food availability and the degree that they have been, or are currently being, fished. Like many mobulid species, the Spinetail Devil Ray&#160;is often solitary but may aggregate in large numbers to feed or reproduce. Abundance estimates have been attempted with aerial surveys in some areas like the northwest Mediterranean Sea, where a population of up to 12,700 individuals was estimated (Fortuna <em>et al</em>. 2014, Notarbartolo di Sciara <em>et al</em>. 2015).<br/><br/>In the Mediterranean Sea, the population trend is unknown, but it is suspected to be decreasing.<br/><br/>In India, population reductions are suspected based on declines in devilray catches, while effort has increased in several regions, including Kerala, along the Tuticorin coast, and Mumbai (Mohanraj <em>et al</em>. 2009, Couturier <em>et al</em>. 2012). Landings data from trawlers operating out of Mumbai revealed maximum landings of 6.3 tonnes (t) for '<em>M. diabolus</em>' (an invalid name, possibly referring at least in part to the Spinetail Devil Ray) in 1993–95 surveys, declining to 4.8 t in 1996–98, and then to 3.1 t in 1999–2001 and 2002–2004 (Raje and Zacharia 2009). This represents a 51% decline in landings over approximately 10 years during which time fishing effort almost doubled. From this decline in catch and increase in effort, local population declines can be inferred. Such declines are unquantifiable to species-level given the potential grouping of several species under one synonym and the difficulty of identification. In Sri Lanka, fishermen have reported declines in mobulid catches over the past 5 to 10 years as targeted fishing pressure has increased (Fernando and Stevens 2011). Data collected since 2011 shows a steady decline in both 2013 and 2014, although fishing pressure has either remained stable or increased (D. Fernando unpubl. data). Overall, the rate of population reduction of devilrays appears to be high in the region. The scale and effects of devilray fisheries in Sri Lanka and India suggest considerable population reduction regionally (Heinrichs <em>et al</em>. 2011). <br/><br/>In Southeast Asia, mobulids have been increasingly targeted in many countries, most notably the Philippines and Indonesia. In Indonesia, the landed catch of 'mobulids' and '<em>Mobula </em>spp.' has declined by 63–94% over a 15-year period in three main landing sites (Tanjung Luar, Lombok; Lamakera, Solor, and Cilacap, West Java), despite evidence of increased directed fishing effort at two of the sites (Tanjung Luar and Lamakera; Lewis <em>et al</em>. 2015). From 2001–2014, landings of Spinetail Devil Ray&#160;declined by 96% in Tanjung Luar, and by 50% in Cilacap (Lewis <em>et al</em>. 2015). Local population depletions can be inferred from an increase in the number of operating fishing vessels concurrent with these landed catch declines. Intense and increasing fisheries for mobulids (which includes the Spinetail Devil Ray), including some fisheries that have been operating for many decades, are now facing depletion of stocks, with the fishery either collapsing or fishers having to seek out new fishing grounds often significantly further distances away (Dewar 2002, Lewis <em>et al</em>. 2015). Intense, directed fisheries (over 22 active fishery sites) for mobulid species have existed in the Philippines, particularly the Sulu Sea, for over a century with steep historical declines suspected based on fishing effort and landings data (Alava 2002, Acebes and Tull 2016, Rambahiniarison <em>et al</em>. 2018). As in Indonesia, depletion is suspected in areas, although targeted fishing continues in some locations (Rambahiniarison <em>et al</em>. 2018).<br/><br/>Throughout most of its range, populations of the Spinetail Devil Ray appear to be in decline, due to directed fishing and incidental capture as bycatch. Declines can be inferred in many regions based on declines in landings or sightings concurrent with increasing effort (Couturier <em>et al</em>. 2012, Ward-Paige <em>et al</em>. 2013, Croll <em>et al</em>. 2016). Furthermore, reports from fishers and traders of devilray gill plates indicate that they are becoming harder to source, with prices escalating as the supply continues to decline (O’Malley <em>et al</em>. 2017). Regional extinction is suspected in areas with intense and increasing fishing pressure (Lewis <em>et al</em>. 2015). In some parts of its distribution such as Australia, New Zealand, and some Pacific countries, the threat would likely be far less than elsewhere due to lower fishing pressure and in the former two countries, strong fisheries management. Globally, based on current levels of exploitation and declining population trends, the suspected population reduction is 50–79% over the past three generation lengths (38 years), with a further population reduction suspected over the next three generation lengths (2018–2056).",Decreasing,"<span lang=""en-GB"">  <p>The Spinetail Devil Ray is circumglobal in temperate and tropical waters throughout all oceans. Notably, it is present in the Mediterranean Sea but absent in the Red Sea (Notarbartolo-di-Sciara 1987, Notarbartolo di Sciara <em>et al.</em> 2017) and its occurrence is patchy throughout its distribution (Lawson <em>et al.</em> 2017).</p>","<p>  </p><p>  </p><p>  </p><p>Mobulids are widely used for their meat, skin, liver oil, and gill plates (Couturier <em>et al.</em> 2012).

The meat from mobulids is often used for food and shark bait or attractant, and the skin is sometimes used for leather products (shoes, wallets, and knife handles). Mobulids including the Spinetail Devil Ray are used in aquarium display  tanks, e.g. in some Gulf countries (R.

Short of that, improved reporting of catch and discard data, regional and national limits on catch based on scientific advice and/or the precautionary approach, efforts to minimize bycatch mortality, protocols for safe release, and codes of conduct for responsible tourism are urgently needed, as is full implementation of additional commitments agreed through international treaties.

177163701,39328,Squatina californica,Near Threatened,,2020,2014-12-03 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The Pacific Angel Shark (<em>Squatina californica</em>) occurs off the coast of North America from Alaska to Baja California, Mexico (including the Gulf of California), where it is associated with soft bottom habitats. It grows slowly and matures late in life (8-13 years), has an estimated generation length of 11.7-17.0 years, and&#160;produces an average of six pups per year. Based on these life history characteristics and the potential for isolation due to patchy habitat distributions and restricted movement patterns, resident stocks of Pacific Angel Shark may be vulnerable to heavy localized fishing pressure.<br/><br/>This species was commercially harvested in California beginning in the late 1970s. In response to a decline in landings, management measures (including a ban on nearshore gillnets and&#160;minimum size limits) significantly reduced the landings in California and these landings have stabilized at low levels over the past decade (2005-2014). In Mexico this species is still fished, and logbooks have been required in targeted shark fisheries since 2006. The population trend remains unknown, but reported landings data (2003-2015) from Baja California suggest that landings declines of &gt;99% may occur within three generations if current trends continue. While landings data cannot be equated with population declines, fishing pressure in Mexico has likely remained relatively stable over time. Given that this species is taken in targeted elasmobranch fisheries in Mexico,&#160;and that landings have declined under stable fishing pressure, this species is globally assessed as Near Threatened, with a suspected population decline approaching 30% over three generations. In the United States, however, this species is considered Least Concern, as the threat of targeted commercial fishing has ceased, and ground fisheries along the west coast of the United States are managed.","Pacific Angel Shark are relatively small, benthic elasmobranchs, that are commonly found in soft bottom habitats, including shallow bays and estuaries, as well as around rocky reefs and kelp forests (Feder <em>et al</em>. 1974, Ebert 2003). It lives in relatively shallow waters to depths of 100 m, but it is much more abundant in nearshore, coastal waters (Eschmeyer <em>et al</em>. 1983). They are fairly residential, restricting their movements to a small geographic area, possibly on the order of 150 ha or 375 acres, with the potential to make longer distance movements (Ebert 2003, Love 2011). For example, one Pacific Angel Shark tagged in Catalina Island was recaptured three and a half years later at Santa Cruz Island, a distance of approximately 100 km (Leet <em>et al</em>. 2001). They are generally quiescent during the day, often remaining buried in the sediment, but become quite active and hunt during the night (Pittenger 1984, Leet <em>et al</em>. 1992, 2001; Castro 2011). They appear to exhibit a high degree of site fidelity, with reports of sharks having preferred foraging and resting locations (Standora and Nelson 1977, Love 2011).<br/><br/>Numerous techniques of ageing and age verification have been used on Pacific Angel Shark, but none except tag-recapture have been successful at estimating their growth rates or age-specific processes (Natanson and Cailliet 1990, Cailliet <em>et al</em>. 1992). These tag-recapture data, however, allowed an estimate of von Bertalanffy growth and demography parameters that predicted relatively slow growth and moderate fecundity, with maturity occurring relatively late in life. Off California, males and females begin to mature between 90-100 cm total length (TL), with an average reproductive age of 8-13 years (Cailliet <em>et al</em>. 1992, Cortes 2002, H. Mollet unpublished data 2005). All males and females larger than 103 cm and 112 cm, respectively, are mature (Natanson and Cailliet 1986). In the Gulf of California, Pacific Angel Shark mature at a smaller size, 75.6 cm for males and 77.7 cm for females (Romero-Caicedo <em>et al</em>. 2016). Age at maturity of the Pacific Angel Shark in California is around 10 years, but ranges from 8 to 13 years (Natanson and Cailliet 1986, Cailliet <em>et al</em>. 1992). The reproductive mode of this angelshark is aplacental viviparity. Females give birth to 1-13 pups (average six) after a 10 month gestation with pupping occurring between March and June (Natanson and Cailliet 1986, Ebert 2003). Size at birth is approximately 25 cm TL (Natanson and Cailliet 1986). Maximum reported length is 152 cm TL for females and 118 cm for males (Natanson 1984), and maximum length in the Gulf of California was estimated at 99 cm TL (Romero-Caicedo <em>et al</em>. 2016). Maximum age is around 22-35 years (Natanson 1984, Cailliet <em>et al</em>. 1992, Cortes 2002, H. Mollet unpub. data 2005). Generation length is estimated to be 11.7-17.0 years (Cailliet <em>et al</em>. 1992, Cortes 2002, H. Mollet unpub. data 2005).","Historically, the Pacific Angel Shark was discarded at sea or used as bait, but in the 1970s a commercial fishery in California began targeting this species. A rapid increase in Pacific Angel Shark landings between 1983-1986 occurred in California (Richards 1987), leading to concern that stocks could be overexploited. Even though a minimum size was proposed for the gillnet fishery targeting both California Halibut (<em>Paralichthys californicus</em>) and Pacific Angel Shark, this measure proved not to be effective at reversing the declining population levels along the Santa Barbara/Ventura coast and Channel Islands areas, California (Richards 1987, Cailliet&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1993). Additionally, it was observed that declines in landings were occurring prior to the implementation of these management strategies indicating the over-exploitation of the species within the region (Leet <em>et al</em>. 2001).<br/><br/>In Mexico this species is caught in fisheries targeting elasmobranchs. Fishing effort in Mexico is challenging to quantify, as some fishers hold licenses but are inactive, while others may share a single license among multiple vessels (Sosa-Nishizaki, pers. comm. 2016). This species is now absent from regions in Baja California Sur where it was historically found in catches (Laguna San Ignacio and Bahia Magdalena), and there is also evidence for depensation in this region (Ramirez-Amaro&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2013).","No information on stock size or structure has been documented for the species. However, three genetically distinct populations have been described off of the west coast of the United States within the California Channel Islands (Northern Channel Islands, Southern Channel Island, and along the mainland) that are most likely separated by deepwater channels (Gaida 1997). It has also been suggested that populations on the Pacific side of Baja California are distinct from that of the Gulf of California (Ebert 2003). Currently, support for these possibly divergent lineages has not been provided and the existence of distinct genetic subpopulations from throughout the eastern Pacific distribution of the species has not been assessed. Because of its rather limited geographical range and evidence of only limited exchange among regional stocks within this range, resident stocks near large population centres may be particularly vulnerable to heavy localized fishing pressure.<br/><br/>This species was commercially fished in California beginning in the late 1970s. In 1977 landings totalled 0.15 metric tones (mt), and during the expansion phase of the commercial fishery for this species, landings rose dramatically to 117 mt in 1981, and to 277 mt in 1984. Landings peaked and began to decline from 426 mt in 1987 to 112 mt in 1990. While declines were observed around this time, these declines were not strictly a reflection of population declines, as a minimum size limit was proposed in 1987 and became law in 1989 (Leet <em>et al</em>. 2001). In 1991, a 50% decline in effort occurred in response to bans on gill and trammel nets in California. This also had a dramatic effect on the landings, which dropped to 8.62 mt in 1995 and 8.16 mt in 1997, but then increased to 15 and 24 mt in 1997 and 1999, respectively. At the same time that landings were dropping in California, a Mexican gillnet fishery began targeting Pacific Angel Shark in 1997, with estimated landings of close to 163 mt in 1999 (Leet <em>et al</em>. 2001). More recently, landings in California have stabilized at around 6.81 to 4.04 mt from 2005 to 2014 (California Department of Fish and Wildlife 2000-2014).<br/><br/>Little is known about the effect of fisheries on the population of the Pacific Angel Shark in Mexico, but landings in some areas have declined and researchers have detected changes in size composition. Fisher interviews conducted along the coast of Baja California also suggest that catches have declined over time (Sergio Ramirez, pers. comm., 2 December 2016). Logbook data from the demersal trawl fleet in San Felipe, Baja California report catches of 663 to 6,375 kg from 2009-2013. Data on landed weight of the Pacific Angel Shark from Baja California reported to Bahia de Los Angeles are available over twelve years (2003-2015; CONAPESCA). These data suggest that landings have declined steadily from a peak of 83,778 kg in 2012 to 16,173 kg in 2015, representing a decline in landings of &gt;99% over three generations (2003-2057) if fishing continues at the same rate (CONAPESCA). Changes in Mexican fishing effort are difficult to detect, but effort is estimated to be relatively stable. Species-specific landings data are also available for Sonora state, but no trends in landings are yet clear (CONAPESCA).<br/><br/>A survey of landings of artisanal fishers targeting elasmobranchs was conducted in Sonora, Mexico (Gulf of California) from 1998-1999. Pacific Angel Shark constituted 1.3% of the total chondrichthyan landings, increasing to 3.3% in winter, which was considered ""a notable contribution"" by the authors (Bizzarro <em>et al</em>. 2009a). Surveys were also conducted on the Gulf of California side of the Baja peninsular and found Pacific Angel Shark to constitute 11.6% of the total chondrichthyan landings (Bizzarro <em>et al</em>. 2009b). Along the Pacific coast of the Baja peninsula, an artisanal fishing community survey conducted between 2006 and 2008, determined that this species made up 1.86% of the total elasmobranch landings (Cartamil <em>et al</em>. 2011). In a survey focusing on the Pacific coast of Baja California Sur, this species was found to make up 5.6% of the elasmobranch catch (a catch-per-unit-effort of 1.82 individuals per vessel per trip; Ramirez-Amaro <em>et al</em>. 2013).",Decreasing,"The Pacific Angel Shark occurs off the coast of North America from Alaska to the tip of Baja California, Mexico (including the Gulf of California), and&#160;is particularly abundant in central and southern California (United States) waters, especially off the coast of Santa Barbara (Natanson and Cailliet 1986, 1990; Leet <em>et al.</em> 1992, 2001) and off El Barril, Baja California (Castro 2005).&#160;It was previously reported that the&#160;South Pacific Angel Shark (<em>Squatina armata</em>) was a possible synonym of this species, but&#160;this has largely been confirmed to be a separate species (Stelbrink&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2010). Further evidence to support that Pacific Angel Shark does not occur in Chile was provided in a recent checklist for elasmobranchs in Chilean waters, where South Pacific Angel Shark but not Pacific Angel Shark was reported to occur (Bustamante <em>et al</em>. 2014).",This species is valued for its meat.,Marine,"The northeast Pacific population of the Pacific Angel Shark appears to have stabilized, at least in the waters of California.&#160;A ban on gillnet fisheries that targeted the California Halibut (<em>Paralichthys californicus</em>) was voted into law by Californians in 1990&#160;(Proposition 132). Through this ban, the fishery is indirectly regulated (Cailliet <em>et al.</em> 1992, Leet <em>et al.</em> 1992). Additionally, a minimum retention size limit became law in 1989, which decreased the juvenile catch and overall harvest on exploited stocks.&#160;Drift gillnet fisheries are also prohibited off the coast of Washington state.<br/><br/>Further north, along the United States west coast (Washington, Oregon and California), ground fisheries are managed by a federal Groundfish Fishery Management Plan. Although this species is not a focal species of the plan, and no species-specific data on the Pacific Angel Shark will be collected, other&#160;chondrichthyans&#160;are being managed under this program.<br/><br/>In Mexico, some fisheries are required to record species-specific data under the category of ""angelito"" (Pacific Angel Shark) in logbooks.

It is known from six stranded or drifting specimens off Hokkaido, Japan; one from Kunashir Island and two from Sakhalin Island, Russia; and two from Unalaska Island (eastern Aleutian Islands) and a few from the Alaska Peninsula, USA (Morin <em>et al.</em> 2017, Yamada <em>et al</em>. 2019, Fedutin <em>et al. </em>2020). Because this species is easily confused with Baird’s Beaked Whale in the wild, it could either be rare or uncommon (see Supplementary Information for definitions), though the paucity of strandings makes being rare more likely. The distribution is limited to cold-temperate waters of the North Pacific west of the Gulf of Alaska. Anthropogenic threats have been identified, including direct hunting and bycatch.<br/><br/>Sato’s Beaked Whale<em> </em>was not assessed previously as it was only described as a new species in August 2019. The Red List Guidelines (Version 14, 2019) state that: “If the data are so uncertain that both CR and LC are plausible categories, the taxon can be listed as DD.” However, LC is not plausible because the species is likely rare and has a relatively small distribution such that demographically independent populations that could buffer risk cannot be assured and with known threats in a substantial portion of that distribution (see the Supplementary Information). Small numbers of human-caused deaths can result in declines in cetaceans given their low maximum growth rates. Given that the advice in the Guidelines is to be precautionary, Least Concern is not an option. Data on the distribution of Sato’s Beaked Whale come primarily from strandings, and densities across the species’ known range are unknown. Well-documented threats, including direct hunting and bycatch, may be present in more than half of the total distribution, if the western portion of the range contains more than half of the total population of Sato’s Beaked Whale. Should that be the case, the most plausible categories would be CR and EN. However, the converse is also true; that is, if the western portion of the range contains less than half of the total population, then the risk to the species is less and the plausible categories range from EN to NT (see the Supplementary Information for further explanation) under criterion A4b. Overall, plausible categories range from CR to NT. Given the large uncertainties about this newly named species, the category Near Threatened, which applies to taxa that do not qualify as threatened now, but may be close to qualifying for at least Vulnerable, is the most appropriate.</p>","Almost nothing is known about habitats and ecology of Sato’s Beaked Whale but these are assumed to be similar to Baird's Beaked Whale, with primary habitat on or near the continental slope and on or near oceanic seamounts in cold-temperate waters. Like Baird's Beaked Whales, Sato’s Beaked Whales probably feed mainly on deepwater and bottom-dwelling gadiform fishes, cephalopods, and crustaceans (Balcomb 1989, Kasuya 2009).","<p>Little specific information is available on anthropogenic threats to Sato’s Beaked Whale (Yamada <em>et al</em>. 2019). </p>  <p>Although there has never been a directed hunt for Sato’s Beaked Whales, they could well be taken at least occasionally in the directed hunt for Baird’s Beaked Whales in the Okhotsk Sea off northern Hokkaido, Japan (Kasuya 2017).&#160; One unidentified <em>Berardius</em> assumed to have been a Sato’s Beaked Whale was killed incidentally in fishing gear off Shibetsu, Hokkaido in July 2004 (Yamada <em>et al</em>. 2019, Fig. 1). Drift gillnets and longlines (both active and abandoned) are abundant and widespread in the ocean, and beaked whales are known to become entangled and drown in such gear (Nishimura and Nishiwaki 1964, Julian and Beeson 1998, Waring <em>et al.</em> 2009). The extent of this threat to Sato’s Beaked Whales is unknown.</p>  <p>There is increasing evidence that loud underwater sounds, such as those from active sonar and seismic operations, can be harmful to beaked whales (Cox <em>et al.</em> 2006). In particular, the use of active sonar by military vessels has been implicated in numerous strandings of beaked whales, including several <em>Mesoplodon</em> species (Balcomb and Claridge 2001, Wang and Yang 2006, D’Amico <em>et al</em>. 2009, Filadelfo <em>et al.</em> 2009). The exact causes of such strandings are often not clear, but stranded individuals sometimes suffer from chronic and acute tissue damage due to <em>in vivo</em> formation of gas bubbles, possibly resulting from decompression sickness (Frantzis 1998, Jepson <em>et al.</em> 2003, Fernández <em>et al</em>. 2005). There is one documented mass stranding of Baird’s Beaked Whales in Japan and two in Mexico.</p>  <p>Ingestion of plastic by marine organisms is a widespread and increasing problem, and possibly a significant cause of mortality cetaceans, especially beaked whales (Simmonds 2012, Fossi <em>et al</em>. 2018). Macroplastic items can block the digestive tract and lead to death (Secchi and Zarzur 1999), and microplastics (&lt;5 mm; Baulch and Perry 2014, Lusher <em>et al.</em> 2015) can leach toxic chemicals (Baini <em>et al.</em> 2017). </p>  <p>Subramanian et al. (1988) reported relatively low values of PCBs and DDE in Baird’s Beaked Whales. Organochlorine and halogenated dimethylbipyrrole residues have been identified in the tissues of Baird’s Beaked Whales (Prudente <em>et al</em>. 1997, Haraguchi <em>et al</em>. 2006) and various mesoplodonts (Kajiwara<em> et al</em>. 2006, Bachman <em>et al.</em> 2014, Anezaki <em>et al</em>. 2016). However, no Sato’s Beaked Whales have been examined for pollutants. Therefore, any potential health hazard from exposure to chemical pollutants is unknown.</p>  <p>Predicted impacts of global climate change on the marine environment may affect this species (Learmonth <em>et al.</em> 2006).</p>  <p>Although none of the above factors, when considered in isolation, appears to represent an immediate threat to this species, the cumulative effects could be unsustainable for what is likely a rare, or at least uncommon, species.</p>","There is no abundance or trend information for this species. The only abundance estimate for “Baird’s Beaked Whales” (including the new species) within the range of Sato’s Beaked Whale is 663 from the southern Okhotsk Sea in the 1980s (Miyashita 1990). However, Sato’s Beaked Whale is probably rare, given the small number of confirmed strandings.",Decreasing,"<p>Sato’s Beaked Whales are known from the cold-temperate western and central North Pacific (Yamada <em>et al</em>. 2019, Morin <em>et al</em>. 2017, Fedutin <em>et al. </em>2020). There are four records based on skull characteristics from northern Hokkaido, Japan; two from Sakhalin Island and one from Kunashir Island, Russia; and two from Unalaska Island, and a few from the Alaska Peninsula, Alaska, USA (Yamada <em>et al</em>. 2019, Morin <em>et al</em>. 2017, Fedutin <em>et al. </em>2020). There are six confirmed genetic samples from Japan and this includes the four specimens based on skull characters (Yamada et al 2019). Morin <em>et al</em>.

They are generally not common or highly abundant, but can be common around oceanic islands and archipelagos. The sum of existing abundance estimates for Rough-toothed Dolphins is approximately 220,000 individuals. Since estimates are available for only a small proportion of the range of the species, the total abundance is likely considerably greater than this. The species was assessed as Least Concern in 2008 (Hammond <em>et al</em>. 2012). While there is little information available on trends, no major threats have been identified, thus the species is again assessed as Least Concern.</p>","<p>The Rough-toothed Dolphin is an oceanic species occurring in deep (usually &gt; 1,000 m) oceanic waters (Maigret 1994, Ritter 2002, Gannier and West 2005). In the main Hawaiian Islands, sighting rates are the highest in waters deeper than 3,000 m (Baird <em>et al. </em>2013). Rough-toothed Dolphins can also be found in shallower waters, over the continental shelf, such as off the coasts of Brazil and West Africa (Flores and Ximinez 1997, West <em>et al. </em>2011). Some island-associated populations are known to exhibit relatively high levels of site fidelity, including in the Hawaiian Islands (Baird <em>et al. </em>2008) and the Society Islands of French Polynesia (Oremus <em>et al. </em>2012). This species is found is relatively small groups, mostly ranging from 5 to 15 individuals (Gannier and West 2005, Jefferson 2018), although groups of over 100 have been recorded (Baird 2016). </p>  <p>The feeding ecology of Rough-toothed Dolphins is relatively poorly known, but their diet includes oceanic and coastal fish and cephalopods (Lodi and Hetzel 1999). In some regions, they have been observed feeding on large pelagic fishes, particularly Common Dolphinfish (<em>Coryphaena hippurus</em>) (Pitman and Stinchcomb 2002).</p>  Rough-toothed Dolphins can form mixed-species associations with a variety of cetacean species, including Common Bottlenose Dolphins (<em>Tursiops truncatus</em>), Fraser’s Dolphins (<em>Lagenodelphis hosei</em>), Spinner Dolphins (<em>Stenella longirostris</em>), Atlantic Spotted Dolphins (<em>Stenella frontalis</em>), Melon-headed Whales (<em>Peponocephala electra</em>), False Killer Whales (<em>Pseudorca crassidens</em>), Short-finned Pilot Whales (<em>Globicephala macrorhynchus</em>) and Humpback Whales (<em>Megaptera novaeangliae</em>) (see West <em>et al</em>. 2011 for a review).","<p>Small numbers of Rough-toothed Dolphins are (or have been) taken opportunistically in directed dolphin hunts in the Solomon Islands, Sri Lanka, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, Taiwan, West Africa, New Guinea, Japan, and possibly St. Helena (Caldwell and Caldwell 1975, Mitchell 1975, Nishiwaki and Uchida 1977, Leatherwood and Reeves 1989, Miyazaki and Perrin 1994, Perrin <em>et al</em>. 2005, Young and Iucidello 2007). Kasuya (2018) reported that in Japan, Rough-toothed Dolphin remains have been found at Taiji, that 4 individuals were taken in 1991 by hand harpoon fishermen in Wakayama Prefecture, and that drive fisheries off the Izu Peninsula killed at least 80 between 1932 and 1972.</p><p>Rough-toothed Dolphins sometimes remove bait and catch from fishing gear, particularly longlines, and this sometimes results in their injury or death. In American Samoa between 2008 and 2012, six Rough-toothed Dolphins were reported as injured in the deep-set longline fishery, and this accounted for almost half of the reported cetacean interactions in that fishery (Bradford and Forney 2014, Hayes <em>et al</em>. 2017). The Rough-toothed Dolphin is one of the main species involved in fishery interactions in nearshore Hawaiian waters, stealing bait and hooked fish (Schlais 1984, Nitta and Henderson 1993). Fishermen reportedly shoot dolphins as retaliation (Oremus <em>et al</em>. 2012, Baird 2016, Baird <em>et al.</em> 2008). Mintzer <em>et al</em>. (2018) reported that Rough-toothed Dolphins are sometimes used as bait in longline fisheries.</p><p>    Rough-toothed Dolphins are killed incidentally in tuna purse seines in the eastern tropical Pacific: 21 were estimated to have been killed during the period 1971-75 and 36 died in a single net haul in 1982. In Ghana, Rough-toothed Dolphins were reported to comprise 6.1% of cetacean bycatches in gillnets (Van Waerebeek <em>et al</em>. 2009, Debrah <em>et al.</em> 2010). From 1992 to 1998 in Ceara State, northeastern Brazil, 13 strandings of this species were recorded, all likely due to gillnet entanglement (Monteiro-Neto <em>et al</em>. 2000). From 1997 to 2015, there were 11 reports of stranding due to bycatch in the eastern Mediterranean Sea (Kerem <em>et al.</em> 2016). Unknown numbers were also taken as bycatch in drift gillnet fisheries in Sri Lanka, Brazil, Taiwan, Cote d’Ivoire, the central North Pacific, and probably elsewhere in tropical and warm-temperate waters around the world (Miyazaki and Perrin 1994, Ilangakoon 1997, Perrin <em>et al</em>. 2005.

In the Hawaiian Island Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), a shipboard line-transect survey conducted in 2010 resulted in an abundance estimate of 72,528 (CV = 0.39) Rough-toothed Dolphins (Bradford <em>et al</em>. 2017). Mark-recapture analyses from photo-identification surveys conducted between 2003 and 2006 have resulted in estimates of 1,665 individuals (CV = 0.33) around Kauai/Niihau and 198 (CV=0.12) around the island of Hawaii (Baird <em>et al</em>. 2008).&#160;In the northern Gulf of Mexico, a summer line-transect survey conducted in 2009 from the 200 m isobath to the seaward extent of the U.S. EEZ resulted in an estimate of 624 Rough-toothed Dolphins (CV = 0.99; Garrison 2016). Along the U.S. Atlantic coast, a shipboard survey conducted in June-August 2011 between the lower Bay of Fundy and central Florida resulted in an abundance estimate of 271 (CV = 1.00; Hayes <em>et al. </em>2017).

It can be seen nesting as high as 3,000 m in the Rocky Mountains (U.S.A.).&#160;The species uses relatively productive lakes and rivers in Iceland. It is a hole-nesting species using natural holes in lava fields and nest boxes erected on farmhouses at the edge of the breeding area (Tucker and Heath 1994). Laying is usually from mid-May although slightly earlier if using nest boxes. It lays 6 to 12 eggs (Eadie <em>et al</em>. 2020). It feeds mainly on benthic invertebrates (Tucker and Heath 1994). Wintering usually takes place on marine habitats (such as bays, harbors, fjords, inlets with rocky shores or mussel beds, creeks, waterfalls, or even storm drains; Eadie <em>et al</em>. 2020). Summer foods include insects and their larvae and plant material, whereas winter diet consists mainly of molluscs and crustaceans (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1992). The species is not truly migratory, with some populations mostly sedentary, e.g. Iceland, and others moving distances of &gt;1,000 km (Eadie <em>et al</em>. 2020).","Hunting occurs on both coasts of North America and eggs are collected in Iceland, but harvest is subject to quotas set to minimise any population impact (Eadie <em>et al</em>. 2000, 2020), hence the present level of hunting is thought to be sustainable for the Icelandic and US west coast populations, but could potentially have a larger impact on the much smaller population on the US east coast (Eadie <em>et al</em>. 2000). Similarly in Canada, annual harvests across five eastern provinces (Atlantic Canada and Quebec) have shown that less than 1,000 individuals are shot per year, with less than 5,000 birds shot by the Pacific Flyway sport harvest (from Alaska, British Columbia, and Washington State), and 3,000 birds harvested in Alaska; hunting pressure is thus considered relatively low (Canadian Wildlife Service Waterfowl Committee 2020).&#160;<br/><br/>Agro-industry plantations have contributed to habitat restrictions due to the loss or degradation of old forest featuring dead trees and large trees with dead limbs, which make for suitable nest cavities. The decrease in available nesting sites may have caused increased chick mortality due to greater distances separating nest holes from water (Eadie <em>et al.</em> 2000, Environment Canada 2013). Oil spills may pose a serious risk both through direct mortality from oiling and longer-term effects of chronic contamination pollution. In particular, the species may be exposed to pollutants when aggregating in wintering grounds which overlap with industrialised seaways such as the Gulf of St. Lawrence, Vancouver, Kittimat and Alice Arm and Baie-Comeau (Eadie <em>et al.</em> 2000). The species is also at risk from contamination of food resources, in particular blue mussels, which is a preferred prey item (Eadie <em>et al.</em> 2000). In Europe, the species is mainly confined to a small area in northeastern Iceland, with 85-90% of the national population occurring at Lake Mývatn and the River Laxá. Such a locally concentrated distribution makes the European population vulnerable to stochastic events, and the 1989 crash in food resources led to a halving of the Icelandic populations (Kear 2005).&#160;<br/><br/>The planned introduction of Atlantic salmon <em>Salmo salar</em> into the river systems and sediment dredging in Lake Mývatn (Einarsson and Magnúsdóttir 1993) could have negative effects on future food availability through altered trophic dynamics in the ecosystem (Kear 2005). The Mountain Pine Beetle (<em>Dendroctonus ponderosae</em>) infestation and forest fires have additionally destroyed many mature forests in the Central British Columbia area (Canadian Wildlife Service Waterfowl Committee 2020<span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">). Recreational sport fishing, boats, and altering aquatic habitats may also reduce food availability and conflict between neighboring&#160;bird territories as the species attempts to flee disturbance&#160;(</span>Canadian Wildlife Service Waterfowl Committee 2020).","The European population is estimated at 800-900 pairs, which equates to  1,600-1,800 mature individuals (BirdLife International 2015); however  Europe represents &lt;5% of the global range. Latest wintering surveys in 2017 recorded 7,700 individuals in the  eastern Canadian population (with 80% of this population found on the  St. Lawrence Estuary and Gulf), with a further 500 individuals  wintering in the Maritime provinces and 100 individuals in Maine  (Canadian Wildlife Service Waterfowl Committee 2020). The western  Canadian population has recently been estimated at 260,000 individuals, with 18,300  individuals present in the Central Interior Plateau Region (observed in  2019;&#160;Canadian Wildlife Service Waterfowl Committee 2020). The recent Partners in Flight (2019) reassessment estimates the North  American population size to be 180,000 mature individuals. The Alaskan  population is unknown, as surveys will usually combine Barrow's and  Common Goldeneyes <em>Bucephala clangula</em>&#160;when counting&#160;(J-P. Savard&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2020). The overall population is therefore tentatively placed in the band 175,000-200,000 mature individuals, roughly equating to 260,000-300,000 individuals, though this number requires confirmation.",Stable,"The major breeding range of this species is along the western coast of the <strong>U.S.A.</strong> from southern Alaska to northern California. Breeding colonies are also found in Labrador (<strong>Canada</strong>), south-west Greenland<strong> </strong>(to Denmark) and <strong>Iceland</strong>. The population in Greenland is likely now extirpated (Eadie <em>et al</em>. 2020). Some populations (e.g. Iceland) are sedentary (primary breeding taking place in the&#160;Mývatn&#160;area; Pearce <em>et al</em>. 2014), whereas others undertake longer trips to winter along the Pacific coast of Alaska and Canada, and the north-eastern coast of North America (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1992). Thus, it is thought to exist in four distinct populations (Iceland, North America, Alaska, and the Pacific Coast (Pearce <em>et al</em>. 2014, J-P. Savard <em>in litt</em>. 2020). Interchange between the eastern and western North American populations is thought to be very rare, and potentially nonexistent (Pearce <em>et al</em>. 2014). The Canadian population is geographically divided into the smaller eastern and larger western populations (Canadian Wildlife Service Waterfowl Committee 2020).",,Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,"<strong>Conservation Actions Underway</strong><br/>Bern Convention Appendix II.

194720078,4292,Cetorhinus maximus,Endangered,A2bd,2021,2018-11-07 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The Basking Shark (<em>Cetorhinus maximus</em>) is a very large (to ~1,100 cm total length), highly migratory, filter-feeding shark distributed mainly in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans in coastal and pelagic habitats from the surface to 1,264 m. It occurs near the surface in temperate waters and deeper, below the thermocline, in tropical waters. The species has low biological productivity with limited fecundity and late age-at-maturity. Although no longer targeted, it is still caught as bycatch in trawl, trammel nets, and set-net fisheries, and becomes entangled in pot lines. The large fins are extremely valuable in the fin trade. Across regions, there have been some severe  historic decline, however there are indications of some stability  and possible slow recovery since cessation of target fishing and high levels of protection.  The global population may now be beginning  to stabilize, with signs of that from the Northeast Atlantic, although elsewhere there is little information upon which is assess stability.<strong> </strong>However, abundances  are still estimated to be well below historic levels  and there is  ongoing demand for the high-value fins, and a global population reduction of 50–79% is suspected over the past three generations (102 years). Therefore, the Basking Shark is assessed as Endangered A2bd.","<p>The Basking Shark is a planktivorous coastal-pelagic species named for its habit of swimming slowly at the surface but it also vertical migrates to depths of 1,264 m (Gore <em>et al. </em>2008). It occurs in temperate and tropical waters, but in temperate waters it is present near the surface and in tropical and equatorial waters, it occurs deeper, below the thermocline (Ebert <em>et al.</em> 2013, Dewar <em>et al</em>. 2018). It is the second largest shark after the Whale Shark (<em>Rhincodon typus</em>)  and reaches a maximum estimated size of 1,276–1,973 cm total length  (TL) (Parker and Stott 1965, Holden 1974, Weigmann 2016). The species  aggregates in coastal waters, with aggregations of up to 1,398  individuals observed in the northeast United States, and it also undertakes large-scale  migrations (Gore <em>et al.</em> 2008, Skomal <em>et al. </em>2009, Witt <em>et al. </em>2014, Doherty <em>et al.</em> 2017, Crowe <em>et al. </em>2018, Dewar<em> et al.</em>  2018). Males mature at 400–750 cm TL, females mature at 690–980 cm  TL, and size at birth is estimated at 150–200 cm TL (Matthews and Parker  1950, Parker and  Stott 1965, Pauly  1978, Compagno 1984, Sims&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1997,&#160;Fowler 2005, Ebert <em>et al. </em>2013,  Francis 2017). Reproduction is viviparous and oophagous with an  estimated gestation of 12–36 months and a likely resting period of two  years between litters (Parker and Stott 1965, Pauly 1978, 2002; Compagno 1984). Only one litter of 6 near-term pups has been reported  (Sund 1943). Female age-at-maturity is estimated at 16–20 years (18  years average) and maximum age is estimated at 50 years; generation  length is therefore 34 years (Compagno 1984, Pauly 2002, Fowler 2005).  Annual rate of population increase is estimated at 0.013–0.023 and  natural mortality is low at M = ~0.07 per year (Pauly 2002,  Fowler 2005).</p>","<p>  </p><p>Currently there are no target fisheries for the Basking Shark, however it was targeted for several centuries by harpoon and net fisheries for meat, fins, skin, cartilage, and liver oil (Rose 1996, Dewar <em>et al. </em>2018, SARA 2019). Surface fisheries have primarily caught large, recently-mated females (CITES 2002). The large fins are extremely valuable in the fin trade being worth up to US$57,000 for a single, large fin (Clarke <em>et al.</em> 2004, Magnussen <em>et al. </em>2007). Targeted fisheries were banned in many countries during the 2000s (ICES 2016, Dewar <em>et al. </em>2018).  The species is still taken as bycatch by trawl, trammel nets, and  set-net fisheries, and becomes entangled in pot lines (Fowler 2005,  Mancusi <em>et al</em>. 2005, COSEWIC 2009, Francis and Smith 2010, Francis and Sutton 2012, Francis and Lyon 2012, Murua <em>et al</em>.  2013, ICES 2018). Many range states across its distribution now have  regulations that require release of live individuals (see Conservation section).  Strikes from recreational and commercial shipping are a threat due to  the species' habit of spending time at the surface (Pirotta <em>et al. </em>2019). Collisions from recreational boats are relatively frequent in United Kingdom waters (OSPAR 2009).&#160;</p>","<p>There are no data on the absolute global population size, although it is likely to be greater than 20,000 individuals (and thus not approaching the thresholds for criterion C: small population size and decline). Genetic results indicate one global population&#160;(Noble <em>et al.</em> 2006, Francis 2017). Basking Shark total abundances have been estimated for a number of regions: 4,200 and 632 (CI: 377–1,058) in the Bay of Fundy, Canada in 2007 and  2011, respectively (Campana <em>et al.</em> 2008, Westgate <em>et al. </em>2014); 10,125  in Canadian Northwest Atlantic waters in 2007 (highly uncertain estimate) (Campana  <em>et al.</em> 2008); 6,671–14,925 in New England shelf waters, United States in 1982 (Kenney <em>et al.</em> 1985); 985 on the west coast of Scotland in 2010 (95% CI: 495–1,683) (Gore <em>et al. </em>2016); and, possibly 19,151 (+/-10,629) for Scotland and Ireland combined (Gore <em>et al.</em> 2013).<br/><br/>Landings and sightings data are available from the Northeast Atlantic (e.g.&#160;CITES 2002, Southall&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2005, Speedie<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2009, Witt<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2012, ICES 2018); landings data are available from Japanese waters (Yokawa 2017); and, sightings-per-unit-effort (SPUE) are available from New Zealand (Francis 2017, M. Francis unpubl. data).<br/><br/>In the Northeast Atlantic, the landings of Basking Sharks declined  dramatically during the period 1946–2017 (CITES 2002, ICES 2018). Landings within  ICES Subareas 1–14 peaked in the mid-1960s and mid-1970s at around 5,000  tonne (t), declined rapidly during the 1980s to less than 1,000 t  annually, after which there was a peak in 1992 of 1,697 t, followed by a rapid decline. There is evidence of serial exploitation and depletion patterns in different ICES Subareas during this fishery. For example,  the artisanal Achill Island fishery, which targeted Basking Sharks in a  single bay with rowing boats, nets, and hand harpoons, declined rapidly after a  decade of high catches during the 1950s and 1960s, and Basking Sharks did not return to this location (CITES 2002). Following the ban on target Basking Shark  fisheries in 2006–2007, landings  declined to &lt;30 t annually and have  been &lt;0.1 t since 2013  (ICES 2018). There are no effort data or catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) data available for recent  years (ICES 2018) which means caution  is required in the interpretation of these data for population abundance  trends.<strong>&#160;</strong>However, the large catch declines during the  1960s to 1980s are believed to reflect unsustainable fishing levels and a  decline in population abundance (CITES 2002, Sims <em>et al.</em> 2015). Since then, public record sightings and boat  surveys in  the U.K. for 1988–2008 suggest population recovery following  cessation  of targeting in the mid-2000s, based on decreased sightings of  small  Basking Sharks and increased sightings of medium-sized and large  sharks  (Witt <em>et al. </em>2012). However, when current research  survey  encounter rates are compared with historical target fishery catch   rates, the population is estimated to be well below 30% of historical   abundance, although it is suspected to be stable and possibly increasing in   European waters (Sims <em>et al.</em> 2015).<br/><br/>In the Japanese target Basking Shark fishery of the 1960s and 1970s,  estimates of catches (in numbers) severely declined during the mid-1970s from a high of about 100 individuals per year until the  fishery closed in the early 1980s, with catches since then at, or near, zero (Uchida 1995, Yokawa 2017). These data are unusual, having records of the same catch (100 sharks) annually from 1967 to 1974 followed by a 50% increase in 1975 and an 87% decrease in 1976, with no information on effort; hence they must be interpreted with caution. In New Zealand, the SPUE over the period 1985–2015 peaked in 1988–1991, which may  have been due to Japanese trawl vessels targeting sharks during that time, but since the mid-2000s catches have been at, or near, zero. The reason for this decline cannot be definitively determined as it may be indicative of changed fishing practices,  regional shifts in availability of Basking Sharks, or a real abundance  decline (Francis and Sutton 2012, Francis 2017). The Japanese and New Zealand data may not be reliable indices of abundance.</p><p>Further to the landings and SPUE data above, there are estimates of population  changes from five regions: Northwest Atlantic, Mediterranean Sea, Southwest Atlantic, Northeast Pacific, and Southwest  Pacific. In the Canadian Northwest Atlantic, declines were estimated in  the Bay of Fundy between 2008 and 2011 based on aerial and boat surveys  from different studies, although direct comparison between the two  abundance estimates is constrained by different estimation methods  (Campana <em>et al.</em> 2008, Westgate <em>et al.</em> 2014). Furthermore,  population models in 2008 suggested a 23% probability that the abundance  was decreasing, although there was high uncertainty in the model data  (Campana <em>et al.</em> 2008). In United States Atlantic waters, there has been no evidence of decline since 1979 (Campana <em>et al</em>.  2008). Population trends in the  Mediterranean Sea are unknown, but it is suspected that the Basking Shark  has declined by at least 50% over three generations (Sims <em>et al. </em>2016).  In temperate waters of the Southwest Atlantic, Basking Shark were  historically common and are now rare (Soto 2000, Lucifora <em>et al. </em>2015).  In the Northeast Pacific, the Basking Shark was persecuted as a  destructive 'pest' and although targeted fisheries ceased in the  1970s,  the abundance is considered to still be at a historic low with fewer  than 6 sightings per year off the coast of British Colombia (Wallace and Gisborne 2006, McFarlane&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2009, Dewar <em>et al.</em>  2018). In the Southwest Pacific, the New Zealand Threat Classification  System found that the Basking Shark was Vulnerable based on the criteria that the population size within New Zealand is likely to be &lt;5,000 mature individuals, with a predicted decline over three generations of 10–50% (Duffy <em>et al.</em> 2018).</p><p><strong></strong></p><strong></strong>Across  these regions, there have been some severe historic declines, however, the global population may now be beginning to stabilize, following cessation of target fishing, high levels of protection, and indications of recovery (particularly in the Northeast Atlantic, although elsewhere we have little information upon which is assess stability). Recovery is expected to take  hundreds of years due to the low biological productivity of Basking  Shark, exacerbated by the removal of adult females by target fisheries (CITES 2002). Abundances are still estimated to be well below historic levels  and there is ongoing demand for the high-value fins, and a 50–79% global  population reduction is suspected over the past three generations (102 years).  Therefore, the Basking Shark is assessed as Endangered A2bd.<p></p>",Decreasing,"<p>The Basking Shark occurs mainly in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans; in the Indian Ocean, it is reported only from southern Australia, Indonesia, and South Africa (Ebert <em>et al.</em> 2013, Fahmi and White 2015).</p>","<p>No utilization or commercial trade of this species is currently known to exist, although prior to 2012, meat and fins were exported from Norway and fins from New Zealand.  No  commercial trade records have been noted in the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) trade database  since 2012, although not all trade records may be reported to CITES.  However, it is likely that if caught, the meat would still be used fresh for  either local consumption or exported internationally along with the  fins.</p><p></p>",Marine,"<p></p><p>The success of actions agreed through international wildlife and fisheries treaties depends on implementation at the domestic level; for sharks, such follow up actions have to date been seriously lacking. The Basking Shark was among the first shark species listed under several wildlife treaties. Many fishing nations worldwide and the European Union protect Basking Sharks through wildlife conservation legislation or apply zero quotas under fisheries management regulations.<br/><br/>In 2002, the Basking Shark was added to Appendix II of CITES, which requires Parties to ensure that exports be accompanied by permits based on findings that parts are sourced from legal and sustainable fisheries. In 2005, the Basking Shark was listed on Appendix I and II of the Convention on Migratory Species (CMS), which respectively, obligates Parties to strictly protect the species and to work regionally toward conservation, specifically through the CMS Memorandum of Understanding for Migratory Sharks.<br/><br/>In 2005, the North-East Atlantic Fisheries Commission (NEAFC) adopted its first ban on directed Basking Shark fisheries in the Convention Area. This measure has since been regularly renewed; the current ban, adopted in 2015, expires at the end of 2019 and will be reconsidered based on scientific advice (ICES 2016). There are a range of conservation measures in the UK, along with a recommended Basking Shark code of conduct (OSPAR 2009). The Basking Shark is listed on Appendix II of the Bern  Convention for the Conservation of European Wildlife and Habitats. In 2012, the General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean (GFCM) banned retention and mandated careful release for the Basking Shark and 23 other elasmobranch species listed on the Barcelona Convention Annex II. Implementation by GFCM Parties, however, has been very slow.<br/><br/>To allow recovery, it is recommended that all Basking Shark retention and landings be prohibited, at least as long as the global population is classified as Endangered. Initiatives to avoid contact, prevent capture, promote safe release, and improve catch (including discard) reporting are also urgently needed, as is full implementation of additional commitments agreed through international treaties (MarLIN 2018).<br/><br/>Basking Shark tourism is managed in some locations but if sustainable tourism industries are indeed to be developed around encounters with these sharks, they should be legislated, continuously monitored, and enforced with permitting systems to make sure operators and tourists are adhering to best practice protocols and codes of conduct.</p>    <p></p>","",,false,false,Global
