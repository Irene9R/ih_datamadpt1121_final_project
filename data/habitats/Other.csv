It is found around rocky shelves and boulders, under rocks. or in deep rock piles near temporary streamlines, seepage zones, and in sheltered rocky scree (Clarke <em>et al.</em> 1999). Most sites have little or no surface water (J.M. Clarke pers. comm.). It has never been observed basking (Czechura 1986b). Activity seems to be initiated by the first heavy falls of rain during the spring-summer period (Czechura 1996a). Calling has been heard between September and March, with calling peaks on warm, wet nights from September to February (Clarke <em>et al.</em> 1999; J. Clarke pers. comm.). Calling is usually most intense at dusk and early evening (Czechura 1986a; Borsboom, Clarke and Cunningham 1998; Clarke <em>et al.</em> 1999) although the species will call all night and all day if conditions are suitable (J. Clarke pers. comm.). The males usually call partially or completely concealed in rock crevices or under leaf-litter and often exhibit territorial behaviour by segregating themselves along the stream (Czechura 1986a), although the species is frequently recorded away from streams or seepages (J. Clarke pers. comm.). Only three gravid females have ever been found: one (the holotype) in early February, another in mid-January and a third (partly gravid) in early December (Clarke <em>et al.</em> 1999; E. Meyer pers. comm.). Large unpigmented eggs were visible through the abdominal wall of specimens found in late January and December (Meyer, Hines and Hero 2001c). Eggs, tadpoles and oviposition sites have not been observed (Clarke <em>et al.</em> 1999). It almost certainly does not breed in streams (H. Hines and E. Meyer pers. comm.). Despite regular searching along creeks, tadpoles of the species have never been found (E. Meyer pers. comm.). The large eggs moreover suggest direct or partially direct development (E. Meyer pers. comm.). The species occurs in situations where water is highly ephemeral, or doesn't pool above the ground (e.g., steep rocky slopes) (E. Meyer pers. comm.). Thus, it seems likely that breeding takes place at the bottom of rock piles, which retain water even when there is little or no surface water available (E. Meyer pers. comm.).","The apparent low population, isolation and extremely restricted distribution of the species make it highly susceptible to demographic instability, disturbance and extinction. Clarke <em>et al.</em> (1999) and Borsboom, Clarke and Cunningham (1998) list five main potential threats to the species: wildfire; domestic and feral animals (as mentioned above); unknown agent(s) responsible for declines of other Queensland frogs; visitor pressure and timber harvesting. Timber harvesting has ceased in the catchments above all known populations (Hines, Mahony and McDonald 1999), but might be a threat to any new populations on leasehold land. Visitor numbers are low at present, but increased visitation might disrupt breeding or impact on habitat. A high-intensity wildfire in 1994 burned into many rainforest patches used by the species (Hines, Mahony and McDonald 1999). A later flood altered stream hydrology and removed leaf-litter in the area (Clarke <em>et al.</em> 1999). The wildfire might be partially responsible for the decline of the species at the monitoring site (Hines, Mahony and McDonald 1999). Modified fire management procedures have now been put in place to reduce the risk of further high-intensity fires (Hines, Mahony and McDonald 1999). Chytrid fungus, a disease found by Berger <em>et al.</em> (1998) to be associated with frog deaths and declines elsewhere in Australia and Central America, was isolated from animals of a sympatric species (<em>Litoria pearsonia</em>). Clarke <em>et al.</em> (1999) and Borsboom, Clarke and Cunningham (1998) list domestic cattle, horses and feral pigs as potential threats to the species. The majority of the Kroombit Tops State Forest is under grazing lease and stock pose a threat to the species mainly through the destruction of habitat and fouling of water (Clarke <em>et al.</em> 1999). A fence has been constructed to exclude stock, but impacts at the head of Kroombit Creek continue. Feral pigs, which might prey upon this species, destroy habitat and act as potential vectors of chytrid fungus (by carrying infected mud to new sites), and have recently been found at all sites occupied by this species (J. Clarke pers. comm.).","The only regularly monitored population, in the head of Kroombit Creek, appears to have declined (Hines, Mahony and McDonald 1999). The species was regularly encountered at this site prior to 1997 but was not heard or seen at this site during the 1997/1998 seasons despite systematic monitoring (Clarke <em>et al.</em> 1999). Data from monitoring transects on Kroombit Plateau indicate a significant decline in numbers over the past 6-7 years, and numbers upstream have declined dramatically since 1997 (E. Meyer pers. comm.). During 1997/1998 little other monitoring work was undertaken in the area but the species was heard calling at three recently discovered sites (Hines, Mahony and McDonald 1999). Estimates of population size are highly conjectural with no more than 13 individuals being recorded from one site at any one time, and only three females have ever been recorded (J. Clarke pers. comm.). No information is available on population structure, genetic variation or metapopulation dynamics. Some populations are almost certainly isolated from others but this has not yet been shown.",Decreasing,"The distribution of this species, an Australian endemic, is extremely restricted and is confined to nine small (up to 54ha) unconnected patches of rainforest (totalling about 200ha) above 500m asl at Kroombit Tops, south-west of Gladstone (Clarke <em>et al.</em> 1999; J. Clarke pers. comm.). It is believed to be a relict species, restricted to Kroombit Tops through habitat fragmentation that disrupted rainforest connections between south and north-east Queensland (Czechura 1986a). Within the rainforest patches, populations are clumped around drainage lines and seepage areas (J. Clarke pers. comm.). The extent of occurrence is estimated to be 18km² and the area of occupancy is estimated to be 60ha (J. Clarke pers. comm). Surveys in February 1997 and regular surveys since 1998 have greatly expanded the known distribution of the species (Clarke <em>et al.</em> 1999; J. Clarke pers. comm.).

Vegetation types typical of these environments include heath land, Melaleuca swamp, sedge land and Banksia woodland (Hines, Mahony and McDonald 1999). It is associated with low pH waters characteristic of wallum environments, usually found in sedge swamps, and less commonly in coastal lakes and creek environs (Liem and Ingram 1977; James 1996; Ehmann 1997). During wet periods these swamps are heavily inundated and the species can be found clinging to emergent vegetation (grasses, reeds and Bungwall Fern; E. Meyers pers. comm.). During dry periods individuals may be found at the base of sedges, grass clumps and/or Bungwall Fern in the same swamps (E. Meyer pers. comm.).

We performed a data-based sensitivity analysis with respect to this threat by evaluating the potential response of the global Polar Bear population to projected sea-ice conditions. Our analyses included a comprehensive assessment of generation length (GL) for Polar Bears; development of a standardized sea-ice metric representing important habitat characteristics for the species; and population projections, over three Polar Bear generations, using computer simulation and statistical models representing alternative relationships between sea ice and Polar Bear abundance.<br/><br/>Our analyses highlight the potential for large reductions in the global Polar Bear population if sea-ice loss continues, which is forecast by climate models and other studies (IPCC 2013). Our analyses also highlight the large amount of uncertainty in statistical projections of Polar Bear abundance and the sensitivity of projections to plausible alternative assumptions. Across six scenarios that projected polar bear abundance three generations forward in time using the median and 95th percentile of estimated GL, the median probability of a reduction in the mean global population size greater than 30% was approximately 0.71 (range 0.20-0.95; see Table 4 in the attached Supporting Material). The median probability of a reduction greater than 50% was approximately 0.07 (range 0-0.35), and the probability of a reduction greater than 80% was negligible. The International Union for the Conservation of Nature Red List Guidelines suggests that assessors consider nearly the full range of uncertainty in potential outcomes, and adopt a precautionary but realistic attitude toward risk tolerance (Section 3.2.3, IUCN 2014). In light of the significant probability, across scenarios, of a reduction in mean global population size greater than 30%, and the relatively low probability of a reduction greater than 50%, we conclude that Polar Bears currently warrant listing as Vulnerable under criterion A3c (IUCN 2014).","Polar Bears occur at low densities throughout the circumpolar Arctic and are more abundant in shallower, ice-covered waters associated with the continental shelf where currents or upwellings increase biological productivity. Seasonally, in the summer open water season, Polar Bears may be found on land in higher densities.<br/><br/>The Polar Bear is a K-selected species with late sexual maturity, small litter size, high maternal investment and high adult survival. The Polar Bear’s reproductive rate is among the lowest in all mammals (Bunnell and Tait 1981) although similar to that of other ursids. Females generally mature at 4-5 years, and enter a prolonged oestrus between late March and early June, although most mating occurs in April and early May. Ovulation is induced by mating (Stirling 2009), and implantation is delayed until autumn. The total gestation period ranges between 195-265 days (Uspenski 1977, Amstrup 2003). Whether or not the embryo implants and proceeds to develop is likely determined by body condition. Pregnant females enter dens in snow drifts or slopes on land, close to the sea (Andersen <em>et al</em>. 2012), or on sea ice (in the Chukchi and Beaufort seas) as early as September/October, but more typically in late autumn (Lentfer and Hensel 1980, Amstrup and Gardner 1994, Wiig 1998). Females give birth inside the den, usually in late December to early January (Derocher <em>et al</em>. 1992, Amstrup 2003). Polar Bears most often give birth to twin cubs; singleton and triplet litters are less frequent. Newborn Polar Bears are blind, sparsely haired and weigh approximately 0.6 kg (Blix and Lentfer 1979). They grow rapidly, fed on rich milk from their mother (36% fat; Derocher <em>et al</em>. 1993), and when they emerge from the den sometime between early March and late April (Pedersen 1945, Wiig 1998), they weigh 10-12 kg (Amstrup 2003). In some regions, after emerging from the den, the female may not have fed for a period up to 8 months, which may be the longest period of food deprivation for any mammal (Watts and Hansen 1987).<br/><br/>Cub mortality is high in the first year (Larsen 1985, Amstrup and Durner 1995, Wiig 1998), with the probability of cub survival largely determined by maternal condition. Mothers with larger fat stores in the fall emerge in the spring with larger cubs which are more likely to survive (Atkinson and Ramsay 1995, Derocher and Stirling 1998, Robbins <em>et al</em>. 2012a). The young usually stay with their mother for two years (Lønø 1970, Stirling et al. 1976, Amstrup and Durner 1995, Wiig 1998), and consequently females on average do not enter a new reproductive cycle more often than every third year most places (Amstrup 2003). In contrast to their low reproductive rates, adult Polar Bears have high survival rates (Obbard <em>et al</em>. 2010).<br/><br/>Polar Bears are the most carnivorous of the extant species of bears. Throughout their range, Ringed Seals (<em>Phoca hispida</em>), preferably young-of-the-year, and to a lesser extent Bearded Seals (<em>Erignathus barbatus</em>) are their primary prey (Derocher <em>et al</em>. 2002, Thiemann <em>et al</em>. 2008). In some areas they are also known to take Harp Seals (<em>Pagophilus groenlandicus</em>), Hooded Seals (<em>Cystophora cristata</em>), and even larger species such as Walrus (<em>Odobenus rosmarus</em>) and Beluga (<em>Delphinapterus leucas</em>) (Thiemann <em>et al</em>. 2008). Polar Bears digest fat more efficiently than protein (Best 1984). Polar Bears are large when compared to other ursid species, which is a consequence of their energy-rich diet. Although birds, fish, vegetation and kelp are eaten where locally available during the ice free-season (Pedersen 1945, Russell 1975, Dyck and Romberg 2007, Born <em>et al</em>. 2011, Gormezano and Rockwell 2013), it is unlikely that Polar Bears would be capable of gaining enough nutritional benefit to survive on a primarily terrestrial diet (Ramsay and Hobson 1991, Hobson <em>et al</em>. 2009, Rode <em>et al</em>. 2010b, Rode <em>et al</em>. 2015).","Anthropogenic and natural changes in Arctic environments, as well as recognition of the shortcomings of our knowledge of Polar Bear ecology, are increasing the challenges for Polar Bear conservation and management. Higher ambient temperatures and erratic weather fluctuations, symptoms of anthropogenic climate change, are increasing across the range of polar bears. Polar Bears are dependent upon Arctic sea ice for access to their prey. Their dependence on an ephemeral habitat that exists as a function of sea surface and atmospheric temperatures means that climate warming poses the single most important threat to the long-term persistence of Polar Bears (Obbard <em>et al</em>. 2010). Arctic sea ice loss has thus far progressed faster than most climate models have predicted (Stroeve <em>et al</em>. 2007) with September sea extent declining at a linear rate of 14% per decade from 1979 through 2011 (Stroeve <em>et al</em>. 2012, Stroeve <em>et al</em>. 2014). Because changes in sea-ice are known to alter Polar Bear abundance, productivity, body condition, and distribution (Stirling <em>et al</em>. 1999, Fischbach <em>et al</em>. 2007, Schleibe <em>et al</em>. 2008, Durner <em>et al</em>. 2009, Regehr <em>et al</em>. 2010, Rode <em>et al</em>. 2010a, 2012, 2014b, Bromaghin <em>et al</em>. 2015), continued climate warming will increase future uncertainty and pose severe risks to the welfare of Polar Bear subpopulations (Stirling and Derocher 2012, Derocher <em>et al</em>. 2013). Arctic sea ice extent is linearly related to global mean temperature, which in turn, is directly related to atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations (Amstrup <em>et al</em>. 2010). Population and habitat models predict substantial declines in the distribution and abundance of Polar Bears in the future (Durner <em>et al</em>. 2009, Amstrup <em>et al</em>. 2008, Hunter <em>et al</em>. 2010, Castro de la Guardia <em>et al</em>. 2013, Hamilton et al. 2014). Although Polar Bears living in historically colder regions of the Arctic might derive transient benefit from a climate-driven transition away from multi-year ice (Derocher <em>et al</em>. 2004), the annual sea ice must persist long enough for Polar Bears to derive benefit from associated changes in seal availability and biological productivity. Recent sea ice simulations suggest large regions of the Canadian Arctic Archipelago will be ice free for &gt;5 months by the late 21<sup>st</sup> century (Hamilton <em>et al</em>. 2014). In other parts of the Arctic, the 5-month ice-free threshold may be reached by the middle of the 21<sup>st</sup> century (Atwood <em>et al</em>. 2015). These studies are based on sea-ice data obtained from the World Climate Research Programme's Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5 (CMIP5) (<a href=""http://cmip-pcmdi.llnl.gov/cmip5/"">http://cmip-pcmdi.llnl.gov/cmip5/</a>). An annual ice-free period of ≥5 months is likely to lead to extended fasting, which is predicted to lead to increased reproductive failure and starvation (Molnár <em>et al</em>. 2011, 2014a, Robbins <em>et al</em>. 2012b). Nevertheless, uncertainty and regional variability in the near-term effects of climate change must be included in Polar Bear management and conservation plans.<br/><br/>Although there have been local and regional studies on polar bear denning habitat (Kolenosky and Prevett 1983, Messier <em>et al</em>. 1994, Lunn <em>et al</em>. 2004, Richardson <em>et al</em>. 2005, Durner <em>et al</em>. 2003, 2006, 2013, Andersen <em>et al</em>. 2012), large scale mapping of Polar Bear denning habitat across the Arctic has not occurred. It is also unknown how climate change will change denning locations and habitats, though predicted increases in forest fires may have adverse effects on maternity denning habitat in sub-Arctic regions (Richardson <em>et al</em>. 2007). Declining sea ice availability can impair the ability of pregnant females to reach traditional denning areas (Derocher <em>et al</em>. 2011, Cherry <em>et al</em>. 2013) and increases of rain events will be detrimental for denning Polar Bears (Stirling and Derocher 1993, Derocher <em>et al</em>. 2004).<br/><br/>The occurrence of diseases and parasites in Polar Bears is rare compared with occurrences in other ursids. However, with warming Arctic temperatures, altered climate could influence&#160; infectious disease epidemiology through mechanisms such as novel pathogen introduction due to range expansion of carrier animals and arthropod vectors; modification of host susceptibility; changes in pathogen evolution, transmission, and number of generations per year; host immunosuppression; shifts in main food sources; altered behaviour; and co-infections with multiple agents (Harvell <em>et al</em>. 2002, Parmesan 2006, Burek <em>et al</em>. 2008, Hueffer <em>et al</em>. 2011). As a result, the potential for exposure to pathogens and resulting disease outbreaks may become more significant threats as Polar Bears experience the cumulative effects of multiple stressors (Patyk <em>et al</em>. 2015).<br/><br/>The warming climate has been associated with an increase in pathogens in other Arctic marine and terrestrial organisms. Parasitic agents that have developmental stages outside the bodies of warm-blooded hosts (e.g., nematodes: Laaksonen <em>et al</em>. 2010) will likely benefit from the warmer and wetter weather projected for the Arctic. Improved conditions for such parasites have already adversely affected the health of some Arctic mammals (Kutz <em>et al</em>. 2013). Bacterial parasites also are likely to benefit from a warmer and wetter Arctic (e.g., <em>Vibrio parahaemolyticu</em>s; Baker-Austin <em>et al</em>. 2012). As the effects of climate change become more prevalent, there is concern about the emergence of new pathogens within polar bear range, new threats from existing pathogens that may be able to infect immuno-compromised/stressed bears, and the potential for new and existing pathogens to cross human–animal boundaries (e.g., giardia). Because of the previous limited exposure of Polar Bears to diseases and parasites (Fagre <em>et al</em>. 2015), researchers have as yet been unable to determine whether they will be more susceptible to new pathogens. However, concern is exacerbated by the fact that Polar Bears appear to have a naïve immune system (Weber <em>et al</em>. 2013), which may make them particularly vulnerable to infection. Many different pathogens have been found in seal species that are Polar Bear prey; the potential therefore exists for transmission of these diseases to Polar Bears (Kirk <em>et al</em>. 2010). If Polar Bears become nutritionally stressed, altered foraging behaviours such as increased feeding on the internal organs of their primary prey and use of alternative foods (e.g., Prop et al. 2015) may increase the potential for exposure to pathogens. Ensuring the long-term persistence of Polar Bears will necessitate understanding how a rapidly changing physical environment modulates exposure to disease risk factors and, ultimately, population health.<br/><br/>Persistent organic pollutants, which reach Arctic regions via long range transport by air and ocean currents as well as river run off, also increase uncertainty for the welfare of polar bears (Obbard <em>et al</em>. 2010, <a href=""www.pbsg.npolar.no"">www.pbsg.npolar.no</a>). Although Polar Bears live in relatively pristine Arctic regions, a variety of industrial toxic substances are brought into Polar Bear management areas from human anthropogenic activities around the world. Polar Bears are apex predators and are therefore exposed to high levels of pollutants, which magnify with each step in the food web resulting in high concentrations in polar bear tissue (Letcher <em>et al</em>. 2010). A key characteristic of these pollutants is that they persist in the environment due to low biotic and abiotic degradation. The contaminant burdens among Polar Bears are known to vary among regions (e.g., Letcher <em>et al</em>. 2010, McKinney <em>et al</em>. 2011). Even where contaminant burdens may be known, their effects on Polar Bear physiol­ogy and health are not well understood (Letcher <em>et al</em>. 2010, Sonne <em>et al</em>. 2012). However, Dietz <em>et al</em>. (2015) showed that the risk for reproductive, immune suppressive and carcinogenic effects in polar bear subpopulations across the Arctic are high due to PCB and perflourinated compounds (PFCs) exposure.<br/><br/>Many of the contaminants are lipophilic and bond tightly to lipophilic tissues. Polar Bears are particularly vulnerable to organochlorines because they eat a fat rich diet. Ringed, bearded, and harp seals comprise the main food of Polar Bears and the blubber layer is preferentially eaten by the bears and subsequently, the intake of pollutants is high (Letcher <em>et al</em>. 2010). Recent studies have documented new pollutants in polar bear tissues which expose the species to even more toxic and complex combination of industrial chemicals (Verreault <em>et al</em>. 2005, 2006; Muir <em>et al</em>. 2006; Smithwick <em>et al</em>. 2006; McKinney <em>et al</em>. 2009, 2011; Gebbink <em>et al</em>. submitted). The potential for contam­inants to impact Arctic systems is predicted to increase as climate warming alters global circulation and precipitation patterns (Macdonald <em>et al</em>. 2005, Jenssen <em>et al</em>. 2015) and predicting local and regional effects will become more complicated and uncertain.<br/><br/>A three decade study (1983-2010) of East Greenland Polar Bears revealed both declines of conventional POPs and increases in brominated flame retardants (BFRs) and PFCs (Dietz <em>et al</em>. 2008, 2013a,b; Riget <em>et al</em>. 2013). The last decade has showed climate related increases in PCBs as well as peaks of BFRs and PFCs due to recent industrial reductions (Dietz <em>et al</em>. 2013b McKinney <em>et al</em>. 2013).<br/><br/>Although the effects of pollutants on polar bears are only partially understood, levels of such pollutants in some subpopulations are already sufficiently high that they may interfere with hormone regulation, immune system function, and possibly reproduction (Wiig <em>et al</em>. 1998; Bernhoft <em>et al</em>. 2000; Skaare <em>et al</em>. 2000, 2001; Gustavson <em>et al</em>. 2015; Henriksen <em>et al</em>. 2001; Derocher <em>et al</em>. 2003; Derocher 2005; Dietz <em>et al</em>. 2015; Sonne <em>et al</em>. 2015). There are suggestions that species with delayed implantation are more vulnerable to the effects of pollution through endocrine (hormone) disruption (Knott <em>et al</em>. 2011). Further, because female Polar Bears are food deprived during gestation, their pollution load increases in their blood, when energy and pollutants are mobilized from their adipose tissue. Because the cubs are nursed on fat rich milk they are exposed to very high pollution loads from their mother (Polishuk <em>et al</em>. 2002, Bytingsvik <em>et al</em>. 2012). This may pose the greatest threat to the species as the vulnerability of pre- and neonatal polar bears is the most sensible to life-long health effects from long-range transported pollution which decreases immunity, survival and reproductive success (Letcher <em>et al</em>. 2010, Sonne 2010).<br/><br/>An additional emerging threat to Polar Bears is the increase in resource exploration and development in the Arctic along with increased ice-breaking and shipping. There are currently no data on the effects of ice-breaking on habitat use by Polar Bears. Although some studies suggest that Polar Bears are sensitive to localized disturbance at maternity den sites (Lunn <em>et al</em>. 2004, Durner <em>et al</em>. 2006), our knowledge about potential effects of large scale development is lacking.<br/><br/>Oil development in the Arctic poses a wide of range of threats to Polar Bears ranging from oil spills to increased human-bear interactions. It is probable that an oil spill in sea ice habitat would result in oil being concentrated in leads and between ice floes resulting in both Plar Bears and their main prey (Ringed Seal and Bearded Seal) being directly exposed to oil. Polar Bears are often attracted by the smells and sound associated with human activity. Polar Bears are known to ingest plastic, styrofoam, lead acid batteries, tin cans, oil, and other hazardous materials with lethal consequences in some cases (Lunn and Stirling 1985, Amstrup <em>et al</em>. 1989, Derocher and Stirling 1991). Another concern is that seals covered in oil may be a major source of oil to polar bears. Although the biological threats and impacts of oil and gas activities on Polar Bears are reasonably well understood (Øritsland <em>et al</em>. 1981; Hurst and Øritsland 1982; Stirling 1988, 1990; Isaksen <em>et al</em>. 1998; Amstrup <em>et al</em>. 2006), mitigation and response plans are currently lacking (but see Wilson <em>et al</em>. 2014). Moreover, how Polar Bears will be affected by other types of human activity are less well known (Vongraven <em>et al</em>. 2012).<br/><br/>Significant portions of the Polar Bear’s range already are being developed and exploration is proposed for many other areas. With warming induced sea ice decline, previously inaccess­ible areas will be exposed to development and other forms of anthropogenic activities (e.g., trans-Arctic shipping, tourism). The direct effects of human activities, the in­creased potential for negative human-bear encounters, and the potential for increased local pollution are all concerns that must be understood if we are to understand and manage impacts on the future for Polar Bears.<br/><br/>Our understanding of Polar Bear population dynamics has improved with ongoing development and refinement of analytical methods (e.g., Taylor <em>et al</em>. 1987, 2002, 2005, 2006, 2008a,b, 2009; Amstrup <em>et al</em>. 2001; McDonald and Amstrup 2001; Regehr <em>et al</em>. 2007, 2010, 2015; Aars <em>et al</em>. 2009; Stapleton <em>et al</em>. 2014). These improved and new tools suggest that previous estimates of population parameters and numbers can be biased. Vital rates are subpopulation specific, and different from the generalized rates that were often used to generate previous status reports (Taylor <em>et al</em>. 1987). For the two subpopulations (Southern Beaufort Sea, Western Hudson Bay) that are known to have been impacted by climate change and where a long time series of abundance exist, harvest represents an additive impact. Illegal take of polar bears in Russia, combined with legal subsistence harvest in the U.S., may exceed sustainable limits for the Chukchi subpopulation (<a href=""http://pbsg.npolar.no/en/"">pbsg.npolar.no</a>). In many cases harvest documentation and the popula­tion data necessary to assess the impact of harvest both are insufficient to allow managers to provide the desired balance between potential yield and take. Given the cultural and eco­nomic importance of Polar Bear hunting in many regions, understanding the potential for and the impact of hunting continues to be a critical part of management (Obbard <em>et al</em>. 2010, Vongraven <em>et al</em>. 2012, <a href=""http://pbsg.npolar.no/en/"">pbsg.npolar.no</a>).<br/><br/>It is important that subpopulation estimates and projections are based on substantiated scientific data. In some areas, studies to estimate abundance occur infrequently so if the harvest rate is either initially set above the sustainable level or it becomes so, the subpopulation may be reduced before the next inventory is made. In addition, harvest practices may have to be reconsidered given recent knowledge about long-term environmental trends and fluctuations that can affect sustainable removal rates. In some jurisdictions in Canada, the governance system includes aboriginal co-management boards and aboriginal hunting organizations. In some of these co-management systems, both local knowledge and science are to be considered equally in both management and research decisions. Although scientific studies have concluded that the long-term effects of capturing and collaring polar bears are minimal (Ramsay and Stirling 1986, Messier 2000, Thiemann <em>et al</em>. 2013, Rode <em>et al</em>. 2014a), some local groups nevertheless consider these techniques disrespectful or harmful to the animals. As a result, population inventory and ecological studies have been delayed or not permitted. On the other hand, alternative research techniques such as aerial surveys and genetic biopsy capture-recapture methods were designed and implemented. Reduced monitoring will constrain governments’ ability to assess sustainability of harvest especially if abundance is estimated from aerial surveys which cannot provide data on vital rates (Aars <em>et al</em>. 2009, Stapleton <em>et al</em>. 2014).<br/><br/>Human caused habitat change and increasing human-bear interactions also must be incorporated into polar bear population projections (e.g., Hunter <em>et al</em>. 2010) and polar bear harvest management in the future. Due to increased access to pre­viously isolated areas, Polar Bears will face increased risks from a variety of human–bear interactions. New settlements are possible with industrial development, and expansion of tourist visitations is assured. Although the fact of human–bear interactions can be reasonably measured, we have a long way to go to understand the effect of such interactions. The added stresses, resulting from a “more crowded” Arctic, may play an important role in the future welfare of Polar Bears.","At present, 19 subpopulation units of Polar Bears are recognized by the Polar Bear Specialist Group (PBSG) of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (Obbard <em>et al</em>. 2010). Genetic studies have shown that gene flow occurs among the various subpopulations (Paetkau <em>et al</em>. 1999, Crompton <em>et al</em>. 2008, Peacock <em>et al</em>. 2015) and there is no evidence that any of the units have been evolutionarily separated for significant periods of time. Although demographic exchange may be limited between subpopulations (Mauritzen <em>et al</em>. 2002, Crompton <em>et al</em>. 2008, Peacock <em>et al</em>. 2015), some demographic and genetic exchange occurs. Consequently, the Polar Bear subpopulations cannot be considered as distinct demographic units and the term “management units” may be more accurate. Ongoing reductions in the duration, distribution, and quality of sea ice due to climate change (Sahanatien and Derocher 2012) may result in different levels of genetic and demographic exchange among subpopulations in the future (Derocher <em>et al</em>. 2004, Molnár <em>et al</em>. 2010), which could lead to&#160; new metapopulation dynamics or to functionally isolated subpopulations.<br/><br/>The PBSG summarized the best-available scientific information on the status of the 19 subpopulations of Polar Bears in 2014 (PBSG 2015) including an assessment of current trend (i.e., estimated change in population size over a 12-year period, centred on the time of assessment). The PBSG concluded that one subpopulation (M’Clintock Channel) has increased, six were stable (Davis Strait, Foxe Basin, Gulf of Boothia, Northern Beaufort Sea, Southern Hudson Bay, and Western Hudson Bay), three were considered to have declined (Baffin Bay, Kane Basin, and Southern Beaufort Sea) and, for the remaining nine (Arctic Basin, Barents Sea, Chukchi Sea, East Greenland, Kara Sea, Lancaster Sound, Laptev Sea, Norwegian Bay, and Viscount Melville Sound) there were insufficient data to provide an assessment of current trend. The type, precision, and time span of data used to estimate trends varies among subpopulations (PBSG 2015).<br/><br/>Estimating Polar Bear abundance is expensive and difficult because the animals often occur at low densities in remote habitats. Although abundance estimates have generally improved in recent decades (Obbard <em>et al</em>. 2010), information remains poor or outdated for some subpopulations. Summing across the most recent estimates for the 19 subpopulations (Table 3 in the Supplementary Material) results in a total of approximately 26,000 Polar Bears ( 95% CI = 22,000-31,000 ). We note that this number differs from what would be obtained by summing abundance estimates in PBSG (2015), because criteria were not the same for including abundance estimates in the two sources (section Population projections). The total number presented here does not include the Arctic Basin subpopulation, for which no information on abundance is available. The 95% confidence intervals presented here were generated using simulation based on estimates of uncertainty in Table 3 and an assumption that the abundance of every subpopulation is independent of the others (see the section <em>Population projections</em> in the Supplementary Material). The mixed quality and even lack of available information on each subpopulation means caution is warranted when establishing and reporting a single estimate of the number of polar bears across the circumpolar Arctic. Therefore we used the abundance data in Table 3 in a relative manner, to scale subpopulation-specific changes to changes in the global population size, rather than in an absolute manner.<br/><p></p>",Unknown,"<p>Polar Bears live throughout the ice-covered waters of the circumpolar Arctic (Obbard <em>et al.</em> 2010, <a href=""http://www.pbsg.npolar.no"">www.pbsg.npolar.no</a>). Although some occur in the permanent multi-year pack ice of the central Arctic basin, they are most common in the annual ice over the continental shelf and inter-island archipelagos that surround the polar basin. Polar Bears that have continuous access to sea ice are able to hunt throughout the year. However, in those areas where the sea ice melts completely each summer,&#160;Polar Bears&#160;are forced to spend several months on land, where they primarily fast on stored fat reserves until freeze-up. Use of land by&#160;Polar Bears&#160;during the ice-free season appears to be increasing at least in some areas where sea ice duration has declined (e.g., Schliebe <em>et al.</em> 2008, Herreman and Peacock 2013).&#160;The southern extent of the range of&#160;Polar Bears&#160;occurs off the coast of Newfoundland, Canada in the northwest Atlantic Ocean. The northernmost documented observation of a&#160;Polar Bear&#160;was at 89°46’N, 25 km from the North Pole (van Meurs and Splettstoesser 2003).&#160;Currently, the most southerly known denning area is on Akimiski Island in James Bay, Canada, at about 52°35’N (Kolenosky and Prevett 1983).</p><p>The species is found in Canada (Manitoba, Newfoundland, Labrador, Nunavut, Northwest Territories, Quebec, Yukon Territory, Ontario), Greenland/Denmark, Norway (including Svalbard), Russian Federation (North European Russia, Siberia, Chukotka, Sakha (Yakutia), Krasnoyarsk), United States (Alaska). Also, vagrants occasionally reach Iceland.</p>","The US, Canada, and Greenland allow and manage a subsistence harvest of Polar Bears; harvest is prohibited in Norway and Russia. The principal use of Polar Bears is for subsistence purposes (Obbard <em>et al</em>. 2010, <a href=""www.pbsg.npolar.no"">www.pbsg.npolar.no</a>), including consumption of meat; use of hides for clothing; and small scale handicrafts. Whole hides may be used for subsistence needs, kept as trophies, or sold on open markets. The financial return from the sale of legally taken Polar Bear hides can provide important income for local people in Canada and Greenland. Sport hunting of Polar Bears only occurs in Canada and must be guided by local Inuit hunters. While communities can decide whether or not to allow sport hunts, these hunts must be accounted for within the annual quota assigned to a community; sport hunts are not additive to the quota. Sport hunting can be a major source of income for remote settlements because the financial return from the hunt greatly exceeds that of the hide value (Foote and Wenzel 2009). This often provides an important infusion into local, cash limited, economies.<br/><br/>Annual legal harvest of Polar Bears is between 700 and 800 or 3-4% of the estimated size of the total population of about 20-25,000 animals. The harvest level has been thought to be sustainable in most subpopulations (PBSG 2010). Although poaching, or illegal hunting of Polar Bears, is not thought to be of major concern, recent reports suggest that illegal hunting in eastern Russia may be as high as 100-200 bears per year (Kochnev 2004). At present, the PBSG is assessing the status of this problem in all jurisdictions. Mortality of bears in defence of life and property occur throughout the Polar Bears’ range and are probably inevitable in areas where Polar Bears and people co-exist.<br/><br/>Polar Bear based tourism, including public viewing and photography is increasing. Well established in Churchill, Canada, it is increasing in other remote areas, including Svalbard, Norway, and to a some extent in locations on the north coast of Alaska (primarily Kaktovik and to a lesser degree Barrow).<br/><br/>Polar Bear products are in trade. The range of different products and units of measure used in records makes it difficult to relate trade data to number of polar bears in trade. Export of Polar Bear products from Canada, where most polar bear products in trade originate, represented between 207 (2014) and 404 (2013) individuals in the period 2010-2014 (Canadian CITES authorities pers. comm.). Greenland introduced a voluntary temporary ban on export of Polar Bear products in 2007. All international trade in polar bear parts is surveyed and regulated by CITES. The polar bear is listed by CITES on Appendix II.",Terrestrial|Marine,"Conservation actions for Polar Bears vary by jurisdiction and detailed information can be found in Obbard <em>et al</em>. (2010) and at <a href=""www.pbsg.npolar.no"">www.pbsg.npolar.no</a>. The International Agreement on the Conservation of Polar Bears that was signed in 1973 by the five nations Canada, Denmark (Greenland) Norway, Soviet Union (Russian Federation) and USA, provides guidance. Article II of the Agreement states that each contracting party “…shall manage polar bear populations in accordance with sound conservation practices based on the best available scientific data,…” and according to Article VII, “The Contracting Parties shall conduct national research programs on Polar Bears…” and&#160; “...consult with each other on the management of migrating Polar Bear populations...”. These articles have been important for stimulating governments to support applied research to answer management questions regarding Polar Bears throughout their range.<br/><br/>In light of the growing concern over Polar Bear conservation in relation to climate change and a number of other issues, such as oil- and gas activities, shipping and tourism, the five Parties have agreed to initiate a process that would lead to a coordinated approach to conservation and management strategies for Polar Bears. A key aspect of this approach is the recognition that plans for action should be developed at a national level leading up to development of comprehensive circumpolar plan for action that address Polar Bear conservation. The Circumpolar Action Plan for Polar Bear is planned to be signed by the parties in autumn 2015.<br/><br/>The Parties recognize that Article VII of the Agreement calls for all Parties to conduct national research programs, particularly relating to the conservation and management of Polar Bears, and that they shall coordinate such research and exchange information on research programs, results, and data on bears taken. The Parties continue to be committed to carrying out research in support of Polar Bear conservation. The Parties also recognize that the technical support and scientific advice on Polar Bear conservation provided by the PBSG supports the 1973 Agreement and is a vital part of the decision making process that the competent authorities should consider in making management decisions. The PBSG has accepted to serve as an independent science advisory body to the Parties.<br/><br/>The PBSG regards the 1973 Agreement as the cornerstone and basis for any action plan on Polar Bears. The PBSG has identified the following research elements to be included in all action plans (Vongraven <em>et al</em>. 2012):<br/><ul><li>Assessment of subpopulation size and/or trend and projection of future status</li><li>Monitoring harvest and other removals</li><li>Understanding movements and distribution patterns and how they are changing with ongoing habitat changes</li><li>Establishing trends in physical condition and why they are changing</li><li>Documenting human-bear conflicts</li><li>Documenting trends in habitat use, availability and trends</li><li>Documenting trends in pollution and disease</li><li>Vital rates estimation, evaluating trends and projection</li></ul>The PBSG recognizes that particular elements (for example, monitoring of pollution and sea ice habitat) are of inter-jurisdictional concern and would benefit from multi-jurisdictional cooperation. Further, the Parties shall consult with each other on the management of shared Polar Bear subpopulations, and exchange information on research and management programs. The PBSG has reiterated that all management actions be based on the best scientific information. The PBSG has identified these management elements to be included in all action plans (Vongraven <em>et al</em>. 2012):<br/><ul><li>Protection of essential habitats</li><li>Use of scientific evidence</li><li>Monitoring, prevention and sound management of human-bear conflicts</li><li>Development of inter-jurisdictional agreements for shared populations</li><li>Development of management strategies to minimize impacts of human activities (e.g. mining, shipping, oil and gas activities, tourism and other human-caused disturbance)</li><li>Management of sustainable harvest</li><li>Ensure the active involvement of the local public living in polar bear areas in developing and achieving the goals of the action plan </li></ul><p></p>",Nearctic|Palearctic,,false,false,Global

17025021,10082,Hippocampus reidi,Near Threatened,A2d+4d,2017,2016-10-04 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<em>Hippocampus reidi </em>is a coastal seahorse species that inhabits corals, seagrasses, estuaries, and especially macroalgae&#160;and mangroves from North Carolina, throughout the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean Sea, to southern Brazil. The species is threatened by the loss and degradation of some of its preferred habitats, particularly mangroves, due to coastal development. It is particularly threatened by being caught as bycatch in trawl and artisanal fisheries (and subsequently used for curios, religious amulets, or traditional medicines), and by being targeted for aquarium use. Although its listing on CITES Appendix II aims to regulate international trade to be sustainable, little is known about domestic trade, illegal and unreported trade, and the overall level of offtake from wild populations. Fishers have also recorded substantial declines in seahorses through much of this species' range. Based on fisher interview data and national listings in Colombia, Venezuela, and Brazil, it is inferred that that this species has declined by more than 30% through most of its range, with declines ongoing. Populations in the Gulf of Mexico appear to be much more stable. Overall, it is inferred that this species has undergone declines approaching 30% which are still ongoing, and therefore <em>H. reidi</em> is listed as Near Threatened.","<em>Hippocampus reidi</em> inhabits a variety of coastal habitats and holdfast types, including invertebrates such as bryozoans, sponges, and tunicates, gorgonian corals, seagrasses, estuaries, and especially on macroalgae (often the genus <em>Caulerpa</em>), mangroves (<em>Avicennia shaueriana, Laguncularia racemosa, </em>and<em>&#160;Rhizophora mangle</em>) and on artificial structures such as piers (Dias and Rosa 2003, Rosa <em>et al.</em> 2007, Mai and Rosa 2009, Gutiérrez <em>et al. </em>2011, Aylesworth<em> et al.</em> 2015). Vari (1982) reports&#160;<em>H. reidi</em>&#160;at depths as great as 55 m. Small individuals tend to be found in shallower water than large animals (Dauwe 1993). In Brazilian estuaries, <em>H. reidi </em>is commonly found at mean depths lower than 0.40 m (Rosa <em>et al</em>. 2007). Indeed, shallow waters, warm temperatures and higher number of mangrove structures could be used to predict seahorse presence in estuarine habitats, as well as calmer waters (Aylesworth <em>et al.</em> 2015). In rocky shores in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, seahorses were mainly found at mean depths of 4.97 m (Oliveira and Freret-Meurer 2012). <em>Hippocampus reidi</em> is mostly found solitary, but mated pairs are common and the species was also recorded to form groups of up to seven individuals (Rosa <em>et al.</em> 2007, Mai and Rosa 2009).  <br/><br/>The species feeds on crustaceans such as harpacticoid, calanoid, and cyclopoid copepods, caridean shrimps, gammarid and caprellid amphipods, nematodes, and ostracods. Juveniles fed more heavily on hymenopteran insects and mollusk and crustacean eggs, and females relied heavily on caridean shrimps (Felicio <em>et al.</em> 2006, Castro<em> et al.</em> 2008). They are usually sit-and-wait predators but sometimes actively pursue their prey (Felicio <em>et al. </em>2006). <br/><br/>As in other seahorses, this species is ovoviviparous, and the males brood the young in a pouch prior to giving live birth (Foster and Vincent 2004). Males matured at 9.5 cm but did not carry embryos until they were 12.4 cm, while mature females were recorded at lengths of 8.8 cm &#160;(Mai and Velasco 2011). A seven month 'resting period' was observed between pregnancies in Rio de Janeiro (Freret-Meurer and Andreata 2008).&#160;<em>Hippocampus reidi</em>&#160;are pair-bonded in the wild (B. Dauwe and M. Nijhoff in litt. to Lourie&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1999, Rosa <em>et al.</em> 2007). Reproduction occurs throughout the year but peak reproduction has been recorded from May- November in NE Brazil (Mai and Velasco 2011). Seahorse pairs were re-sighted in estuaries in Piauí and Rio Grande do Norte states, Brazil (Dias and Rosa 2003, Mai and Rosa 2009), and site fidelity and small home ranges reported in Brazil and in Cuba (Rosa <em>et al.</em> 2007, Mai and Rosa 2009, Mai and Velasco 2011, Hernández <em>et al.</em> 2016) suggest a monogamous sexual pattern. <br/><br/>The von Bertalanffy growth constant (k) was estimated at 1.195/yr and natural mortality ranged from 1.43 to 1.58/yr. Survival was calculated to be between 21% and 24%. Lifespan was estimated to be 2.5 years (Mai and Velasco 2011).<br/><br/>It was suggested that the availability of holdfasts could influence the spatial distribution of these seahorses (Dias and Rosa 2003, Aylesworth <em>et al</em>. 2015).&#160;The feeding behaviour of 57 specimens was recorded from May 2003 to September 2004 in estuarine habitats (Felicio <em>et al.</em> 2006) and 90 specimens had their activity rate evaluated at a rocky shore in SE Brazil, where pregnant males were found less active in relation to females and non-pregnant males (Freret-Meurer <em>et al</em>. 2012).","<em>Hippocampus reidi</em>&#160;is threatened by being caught as bycatch in trawl and artisanal fisheries (e.g. Branco<em> et al.</em> 2015). It is also heavily targeted for the aquarium trade, where fishers have reported substantial declines (Rosa <em>et al.</em> 2011). The species may also be suffering as a result of mangrove, coral and seagrass habitat degradation and loss (Karnauskas<em> et al</em>. 2013, Jackson <em>et al. </em>2014).&#160;                    Particularly, it is potentially susceptible to habitat degradation due to its strong relationship with mangrove structures (Aylesworth <em>et al</em>. 2015).     Experiments show that crude oil and hypoxia events in the Gulf of Mexico result in DNA damage and detrimental morphological functioning of <em>H. reidi</em>, but population impacts are not known (Negreiros<em>&#160;et al</em>. 2011). <br/><br/>This species is considered threatened in the United States by the American Fisheries Society (Musick <em>et al</em>. 2000). They cite the species' rarity and degradation of its seagrass habitats in South Florida as reasons for this listing.&#160;                    Moreover,&#160;<em>H. reidi </em>is considered Vulnerable in Venezuela (Ron <em>et al</em>. 2015), Colombia (Ministerio de Ambiente, Vivienda y Desarrollo Territorial, 2010) and Brazil (IBAMA 2014). In the latter, the species is also listed as vulnerable in red lists of four states (Espírito Santo, Rio de Janeiro, Paraná and Santa Catarina); in São Paulo, it is considered a species in need of fisheries management and policies for its conservation. In Mexico, it is listed on Mexico’s NOM-059-SEMARNAT-2001 as a species subject to special protection.","During Project Seahorse trade surveys conducted between 2000–2001, fishers in Brazil, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua and Panama reported decreases in the catch of seahorses in general both in trawls (as bycatch) and by divers (J. Baum and I. Rosa, unpublished data), but the portion of these declines attributable to <em>H. reidi</em> is unknown. <br/><br/>From October 2005 to September 2006, monthly samplings were carried out at the Mamanguape estuary, State of Paraíba, in northeastern Brazil and a total of 280 seahorses were sampled (Castro<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2008); at the Camurupim/Cardoso estuary, Piauí, NE Brazil, 647 specimens were sampled (Mai and Rosa 2009); and at twelve Brazilian locations, 911 specimens were recorded from 2002 to 2006. <br/><span id=""docs-internal-guid-60f47034-b9d2-2cfe-ea7d-35ee2e6b30fe""><span>  <span id=""docs-internal-guid-60f47034-b9d2-2cfe-ea7d-35ee2e6b30fe""><span><p>In Brazilian estuaries, <em>H. reidi </em>presented a mean density of 0.026 specimens/m², ranging from 0.0023-0.066 specimens/m² at sampled localities from 2002 to 2006 (Rosa <em>et al</em>. 2007, Mai and Rosa 2009).

The numbers of aquarium trade&#160;<em>Hippocampus reidi&#160;</em>that were traded internationally and recorded in the CITES trade database are 148,766 to 317,522 from captivity, 20,478 to 22-662 from the wild, and 2,476 from unknown origins (Koldewey and Martin-Smith 2010, Rosa <em>et al. </em>2011). Between 2010 and 2014 annual reported export levels of <em>H. reidi</em> levelled off at just over 10 000 specimens (CITES 2016). Levels of domestic trade are unknown for most of the species' range. <br/><br/>Data from Brazil indicate that                           daily catches of live seahorses for the aquarium trade from January 1997–April 2004 led to an estimate of 715,000 live <em>H. reidi</em> that could be caught from wild populations annually in Brazil in that period (Rosa <em>et al. </em>2011). Colourful (orange, yellow and red) specimens reached the highest prices; from 1997 to 2005, fishers were paid for a coloured seahorse a mean of US$1.23, while black and brown specimens had a mean price of US$1.04; coloured seahorses retail mean price was US$12.27, and dark coloured US$9.64 (Rosa et al. 2011).

Domestic trade data are available from interviews (n = 92) conducted with fishers and end-sellers from 2002 to 2009 (Rosa <em>et al</em>. 2011). The main source of dried <em>H. reidi </em>seahorses was the non-industrial bycatch in N-NE Brazil; trade volumes were estimated at a mean of 29.7 seahorses sold per month per trader, and a mean of 356.4 dried seahorses sold annually per trader (Rosa <em>et al</em>. 2011).</p>Dried seahorses were usually sold unadorned or as key chains. Occasionally some of them were sold as jewelry, shell crafts with shells and sea stars, or as 'dragons' with wings and eyes attached. These dried seahorses were sometimes ground and consumed in a drink as folk medicine to treat almost 30 diseases and health conditions (Rosa <em>et al. </em>2013), including asthma, bronchitis, gastritis, baldness, wounds, and tuberculosis (Baum and Vincent 2005; Rosa <em>et al.</em> 2011, 2013; El Deir&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2012). Chinese populations in Panama and Peru sold seahorses commercially as medicine, for use as TCM.                     Dried seahorses have also been sold in Brazil for magic-religious purposes, in the form of “seahorse perfume” and amulets (called “pautás”), used to bring protection, good luck and to avoid evil eye, and also to attract emotional and financial success (Alves <em>et al</em>. 2012).    <br/><br/>The live seahorses were traded as aquarium fishes. Also, in some countries, including Honduras and Costa Rica, they have&#160;<em>in situ </em>value because dive masters would take tourists to particular sites where these seahorses were located (Baum and Vincent 2005).&#160;                    In Brazil, this activity is unregulated and performed in at least three NE states (Piauí, Ceará and Pernambuco), under the name of “passeio do cavalo-marinho”, in which seahorses are captured by “guides” and displayed for tourists in plastic or glass jars. There is no scientific impact assessment of this activity in the country (Ministério do Meio Ambiente 2011).     <br/><br/>Levels of overall offtake from wild populations are unknown, but are thought to number at least in the 10s of thousands. The magnitude of the impacts of this use and trade on wild populations is not known.",Marine,"There are no species-specific conservation measures in place for <em>Hippocampus reidi</em>. The entire genus <em>Hippocampus</em> was listed on Appendix II of CITES in 2004. In Mexico, it is listed on Mexico’s NOM-059-SEMARNAT-2001 as a species subject to special protection. Permits or licenses are required to export dried syngnathids from Honduras and Nicaragua, and to export live syngnathids from Panama, Brazil, Costa Rica, Guatemala and Nicaragua. In Brazil, other general measures that may benefit seahorses include a marine ornamental fishes Trade Database, the delimitation of specific airports through which wildlife can be exported, and the publication of an illustrated handbook of marine ornamental fishes by IBAMA (Sampaio and Nottingham 2008). Moreover, only registered fishers are allowed to collect marine ornamental fishes, and only professional fishers have authorisation to sell them, according to the Brazilian legislation applied to marine ornamental fishes (Rosa <em>et al.</em> 2011). All seahorse species in Brazil are included in the Plano de Ação Nacional para a Conservação dos Ambientes Coralíneos – PAN Corais, which establishes priority conservation strategies for threatened fishes and aquatic invertebrates (ICMBIO 2016).  <br/><br/>There are annual quotas in Brazil of 250 specimens per company for the live trade (Rosa<em> et al. </em>2011), although misidentifications as <em>H. erectus</em> may occur (Rosa <em>et al.</em> 2011). In 2004, seahorses were included in the National List of the Aquatic Invertebrates and Fish Species Overexploited or Threatened of Overexploitation (Ministério do Meio Ambiente 2004), which resulted in the publication, in 2011, of a proposal of management plan for the sustainable use of the Brazilian seahorse species. Specifically, the main objectives towards <em>H. reidi</em> were the recovery and maintenance of wild populations and preferred habitats (Ministério do Meio Ambiente 2011). The species distribution falls within several marine protected areas in Brazil (Rosa<em> et al. </em>2007, Mai and Rosa 2009); indeed, some of these were created for and/or improved for seahorse conservation, such those that include the Rio Mamanguape estuary (Paraíba state) and the Rio Tubarão estuary (Rio Grande do Norte state).",Nearctic|Neotropical,,false,false,Global

Avian blood may predominate in the diet of wild individuals, although cattle are occasionally exploited. Unlike other vampires, this attractive bat is gentle and easy to handle. Reproduction occurs year around (Reid 2009). Also occurs in open areas (Aguiar pers. comm.).",There are no major threats throughout its range.

Given the reduction in population size (effective population size below 6,000 individuals), we also assessed criteria C. Due to the fact that all populations may be well below 1,000 individuals, we can also use criteria C2a(i) to assign a Vulnerable category.<br/><br/>Population sizes have been estimated as 750-&lt;1,000 in Chile (Sielfeld and Guzmán 2011), 9,000-13,000 for Perú (Barrioand and Ferreyra 2008), between 1,900-3,000 in Argentina (Regidor <em>et al.</em> 1997, Regidor and Costilla 2003), and 5,000-6,000 in Bolivia (Nuñez 2008, Nuñez and Pacheco, unpubl. Data). Therefore, the total population estimate for the species would be between 16,650-23,000 individuals. Based on population structure data from Perú (74% adults, Barrio 2007), Bolivia (69% adults, Rumiz <em>et al.</em> 2010) and Chile (81% adults, Sielfeld and Guzmán 2011), we may infer that about 75% are adult individuals (11,800-15,750 adult individuals). However, it would not be wise to believe that all adult individuals are reproducing, since effective population sizes for wildlife may average 0.11 of total population size (Frankham 1995). There are no single estimate of effective population sizes for Tarukas, but there is a recent one for guanacos (Sarno <em>et al.</em> 2015). These authors indicate that the relationship between effective population size to census population size range from 0.04 to 0.99, but decreased to 0.24 when only potentially breeding adults are considered. Therefore, if we believe that effective population size is 25% on census population size, then we may be under a conservative scenario of 4,162-5,750 mature breeding Tarukas.<br/><br/>Habitat fragmentation is also a serious threat to the existing subpopulations, especially near human settlements (Rechberger <em>et al.</em> 2014, Sielfeld and Guzmán 2011). Additionally, although there are no single monitoring programs at the regional level, there is a widely shared expert opinion of a perceived continuing decline in a large portion of the species range (Argentine, Chile and Bolivia, Barrio and Ferreyra 2008, Nuñez 2009, Sielfeld and Guzmán 2011), except for a few sites in Argentina, and Bolivia.<br/><br/>Given that most populations seem to be small and given that, with a few exceptions, populations may be threatened by habitat loss, and other threats, we think it is much safer to consider that Tarukas are vulnerable to extinction.","Tarukas have been found at 2,000-3,500 m asl in the southern portion of their distribution in Argentina (Cajal 1983), at 2,500-4,600 m asl in northern Chile (Contreras <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 1986, Lagos, pers. Comm.), and at 3,500-5,000 m asl in the highlands of Peru and Bolivia (Jungius 1974, Merkt 1985, Yensen <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 1994,&#160;Barrio 1998,&#160;Barrio&#160;2004). In Bolivia, this species was also found at lower altitudes (2,300 m asl) at the interandean valley named Araca (Nuñez 2008), which is covered mostly by sparse trees.<br/><br/>Tarukas live in areas with wet weather on the eastern Andes (Jungius 1974,&#160;Barrio 2004), as well as areas with dry weather on the western Andes (Merkt 1985, Contreras<em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 1986,&#160;Barrio 1998). Tarukas are usually found above the treeline on mountain slopes characterized by rock and cliff-like outcrops amid grassland vegetation (Jungius 1974, Merkt 1985,&#160;Merkt&#160;1987,&#160;Barrio 2004). They seem to prefer rocky areas of sparse vegetation with nearby water sources - usually a small ravine, lagoon or marsh (Merkt 1985,&#160;Barrio 2004), however, they have been observed in dense shrubbery near rivers and inside <em>Polylepis </em>sp. forests (Barrio in prep).<br/><br/>In several sections of the distribution, Taruka subpopulations live in fragmented portions of the range (Cajal 1983,&#160;Barrio 1999). The Taruka shares its habitat with domestic stock, which might compete with Taruka and decrease the area available to them (Barrio 1999, 2004).","Threats to the species include competition with domestic stock, habitat destruction, trophy hunting, and predation by domestic dogs (Miller <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1973, Merkt pers. comm). In Bolivia, major threats are habitat destruction and illegal hunting (Nuñez 2009, Rechberger <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2014). Antlers are used in traditional medicine to cure facial paralysis (Tarifa pers. comm.) and dried meat is used by rural populations (CDC 1987). Threats in Chile include conflict with local farmers, predation by domestic dogs and displacement from their former habitat (gorges with water courses) to drier areas (Fuentes-Allende <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2016).","Based on data and assessments from a few localities in every country, the total population estimate would be 15,750-21,000 individuals (see the <em>Rationale</em> for data for each country). According to a conservative effective population size of 25% of total population, we may infer that the number of mature breeding adults may be between 4,162 and 5,750 individuals (&lt;60% of the threshold 10,000 individuals set for a vulnerable category for the species).",Decreasing,"The Taruka occurs as scattered subpopulations with very few contact areas among them, a distribution explained by the specialized habitat it uses. Its distribution can be regarded as almost continuous along the highlands of the Andes from the north of Peru to northeastern Chile, but we should be aware that the habitat type used is isolated in some areas, and human density is high between patches. The Taruka occurs in heavily fragmented subpopulations throughout the high Andes of Bolivia (with no records in the southwest), as well as in Chile (with three fragmented populations between Tacora volcano and Tarapacá gorge, Matta pers. Comm.) and in northwest Argentina.<br/><br/>The historical distribution was probably the same as the current one, but subpopulations might have been less fragmented. Nevertheless, historical (Mellet 1908) and archaeological records (Díaz 1995) suggest that Taruka distribution in Chile extended to Antofagasta district, approximately 590 km to the south of the current limit in this country.<br/><br/>Contrary to several publications (Geist 1998, Weber and Gonzalez 2003, Wemmer 1998), the Taruka has never occurred in Ecuador (Barrio 2013, Pinto <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2015). It is unlikely that the Taruka has ever crossed north of the Huancabamba depression in north Peru, even during the Pleistocene, when the habitat type it currently uses was lower than present altitude. Then, the high Andes were populated by other deer genera (Hoffstetter 1986, Wheeler <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 1976). The asseveration of the former presence of Taruka in Ecuador was based on doubtful records (Tirira 2001). One specimen in the Buenos Aires museum and another in the Field Museum, Chicago, were marked as coming from Ecuador (Voss 2003), but both have disappeared and could have come from anywhere else, for example Peru or Chile, if they were correctly identified. Another two specimens were deposited in the Museo Nacional de Ciencias Naturales in Madrid (Voss 2003). These were authentic records from Ecuador, as the collector, the collection site and the year were identified (Voss 2003), but both specimens were also lost and there is no way to verify the species.","The species is hunted as an agricultural pest, or for sport.&#160;Antlers are used in traditional medicine to cure facial paralysis (Tarifa pers. comm.) and dried meat is used by rural populations&#160;(J.

Recommended conservation actions include: systematic surveys to determine status and extent of geographic distribution; support continued ecological studies of the species throughout its range; strengthen protected areas management; improve livestock management through farmer education demonstration projects.

We suggest that at least three study sites per country should be included, considering the use of a standardized method, probably including direct observations, and spoor. At least one of the sites should be within a protected area for each country.<br/><br/>This species has been evaluated as Endangered in Bolivia (Nuñez 2009), based on a thorough survey within the country (Nuñez 2008).<br/><br/><em>Hippocamelus antisensis </em>has been declared a natural national monument (<em>Monumento Natural Nacional</em>) by Law Nº 24702 in Argentina, since 1996.

Siberian marmots are a keystone species in the communities they inhabit, living in large colonies. The Tarbagan Marmot resembles the Bobak Marmot of eastern Europe and central Asia in mode of life and habits.  Marmots of all ages forage on grasses, but also on 10-15 species of herbs and a few woody plants such as sagebrush.  Autumn hibernation is initiated in September, but is influenced by summer food conditions and fall weather.  Both Bobak and Tarbagan marmots hibernate in groups from 5-20 in a single burrow.  Enemies include wolves, red foxes, and several species of large eagles and hawks.  The Tarbagan Marmot may carry and transmit bubonic plague, and is therefore subject to stringent control measures in many parts of its range. Mating begins in April, after they have aroused from hibernation.  Gestation lasts 40-42 days.  Young appear above ground in June; typical litter size is 4-6, occasionally 8.  Moulting of winter hair in adults occurs about 2.5-3 weeks after the birth of young. Light brown in colouration, with dark guard hairs on the head and on the tail tip. Adults have a head-rump measurement of 50-60 cm and typically weigh 6-8 kg, reaching a maximum of 9.8 kg (Adiya 2000).

Recent surveys estimate that actual trading numbers presently exceed hunting quotas by more than three times, and over 117,000 illegally traded marmot skins were confiscated in 2004 (Zahler <em>et al.</em> 2004). There has been an increase in hunting since the price of pelts increased and factors such as the improvement of roads is providing better access for hunters to find marmot colonies (Kolesnikov <em>et al.</em> 2009).<br/><br/>Outbreaks of plague also constitute a threat, and human plague cases are known to have occurred as a result of marmot hunting (Batbold 2002).

45225150,6204,Cystophora cristata,Vulnerable,A3c,2016,2015-06-07 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"Although there is no reliable, current estimate for Hooded Seal abundance, the population is thought to be relatively large, numbering some few hundreds of thousands. The West Ice stock has been surveyed four times in the last 15 years, most recently in 2012, and it has been declining at a rate of 3.7%/year. The stock in Canadian waters increased during the 1980s and 1990s but the rate of increase was declining over time and with no surveys since 2005 there is no way to know the recent or current trend. However, with changing sea ice conditions reducing the pack ice habitat needed by all Hooded Seals for pupping and molting, there is good reason to believe that numbers in all stocks might be declining. Assuming that the entire population will decline at 3.7%/year (which is the West Ice rate of decline currently), the three generation reduction would be 75% which qualifies Hooded Seals for listing as Endangered under criterion A3c. Even if the overall rate of decline were only 1%/year the three generation decline would be 32%, which would qualify Hooded Seals as being Vulnerable. Given that the population is still relatively large, and there are uncertainties about the rate of future decline we opt for the more modest listing of Vulnerable under criterion A3c for Hooded Seals at this time.","Hooded Seals are a sexually dimorphic ice-breeding pinniped. Adult males average 2.5 m in length and weigh 300 kg (Kovacs and Lavigne 1986), with large animals reaching over 400 kg (Kovacs 2002). Adult females are smaller, averaging 2.2 m and 160 kg, but can reach 300 kg. Pups are born at approximately 1 m in length and 24 kg (Kovacs and Lavigne 1992).<br/><br/>Hooded Seals pup on pack ice late in the spring season, when the pack is already breaking up. The breeding season for this polygynous species is very short, usually lasting only about 2.5 weeks. Males attend a single female and her pup at a time, sequentially re-establishing with a new female if the male is competitively successful (Kovacs 1990). Mating takes place in the water (Boness <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 1988). Hooded Seals have the shortest lactation period of any mammal, with most pups nursing for only four days (Bowen <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 1985). Pups weigh an average of 48 kg at weaning, and on average double their birth mass in the short nursing period (Kovacs and Lavigne 1992, Lydersen <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 1997). The short reproductive period is energetically advantageous to both males and females, with relative losses in body mass being small for both sexes compared to other phocid Seals (Kovacs and Lavigne 1992, Kovacs <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 1996, Lydersen and Kovacs 1999).<br/><br/>Hooded Seals moult in July, with each breeding stock congregating on sea ice north of their respective whelping areas. If mixing does occur, the degree to which it takes place is unknown. Following the moulting period they disperse in the North Atlantic (Folkow and Blix 1999, Folkow <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 1996, Andersen <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2009, Kovacs <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2011a). Apart from the breeding and moulting periods when Hooded Seals form loose aggregations in specific areas, they are thought to live quite solitary lives. However, little is known about them outside those periods. Groups of females and young animals have been seen at the northern ice edge in summer, but it is not known whether the groups are socially facilitated or solely the result of concentrations of prey. Hooded Seal longevity is 25-30 years (Kovacs 2002).<br/><br/>Hooded Seals are very capable divers that spend extensive periods at sea without hauling out (e.g., Folkow and Blix 1999, Andersen <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2013). Most of their dives are from 100-600 m in depth and last 5-25 minutes, however, very deep dives to over 1,000 m and dives lasting almost an hour have been recorded (Folkow <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 1996, Lydersen <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> unpubl. data). Similar to Elephant Seals, Hooded Seals perform drift dives, in which buoyancy controls their movements through the water column (Andersen <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2014). Hooded Seals feed on a wide variety of fish and invertebrates, including species that occur throughout the water column (Andersen <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2013). Examples of typical prey are pelagic Amphipods (<em>Parathemisto </em>sp.), Greenland Halibut, members of the Cod family such as Polar and Atlantic Cod, Redfishes, Sand Eels, Herring, Capelin, Squid (e.g., <em>Gonatus fabricii</em>), and Shrimp (Haug <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2004, 2007).<br/><br/>A recent study of foraging habitat selection by Hooded Seals in the Northwest Atlantic documented significantly different preferences by adult males and females with the former occupying areas with complex seabed relief while the latter concentrated their foraging search effort along shelf areas (Andersen <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2013). Productivity (measured as chlorophyll a) was the most important single factor influencing habitat selection across all age groups.<br/><br/>Polar Bears and Killer Whales are known Hooded Seal predators (Lavigne and Kovacs 1988). These predators are thought to be having increased impacts on Hooded Seals in the West Ice following the deterioration of breeding ice used by this species (Foote <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2013, Øigård <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2014); Greenland Sharks also take at least young Hooded Seals (Leclerc <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2012).","By-catch of Hooded Seals in coastal net fisheries has been reported from the USA, from trawl fisheries off Norway and Newfoundland, and from salmon drift nets used off Greenland (Woodley and Lavigne 1991, Reeves <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 1992, Waring <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2005). Competition for food with commercial fisheries and other predators has been suggested as a factor that may limit population growth or lead to declines of Hooded Seals (Reijnders <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 1993). This factor may be playing a role in the continuing decline of Hooded Seals in the Northeast Atlantic given that abundance of Redfish, which are favoured prey of Hooded Seals, has declined in the late 1990s in both the Barents and Norwegian Seas due to excessive fishing pressure. No targeted catch is allowed for some Redfish species in this region and juvenile fish are being protected to attempt to promote recovery (ICES 2013b).<br/><br/>Impacts of oil spills on Hooded Seals have not been reported; however as an ice breeding species, they might be at risk of mortality from spills during the pupping season when newborn and newly weaned pups could be fouled (St. Aubin 1990). Hooded Seals have been exposed to <em>Morbillivirus </em>(Duignan <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 1997), but are not known to have suffered fatalities during the mass die-offs of Harbour Seals in European waters from phocine distemper virus in 1998 and 2002. Subsequent testing revealed antibodies to the virus in 18-24% percent of the Hooded Seals sampled indicating exposure to the virus (Harkonen <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2006). Hooded Seals in the northeast Atlantic have high organohalogen contaminant burdens that are thought to be impacting thyroid homeostasis (Villanger <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2013).<br/><br/>The Hooded Seal is a pack ice species, and is dependent on ice as a substrate for pupping, moulting, and resting and as such is vulnerable to reduction in extent or timing of pack ice formation and retreat (Tynan and DeMaster 1997, Johnston <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2005, Learmonth <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2006, Kovacs and Lydersen 2008, Laidre <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2008). The very short, intense breeding season of Hooded Seals that is timed right at the end of the sea ice season, has likely put them at heightened risk of impacts arising from changes in the duration of the sea ice season (Kovacs <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2011b, 2012; Stenson and Hammill 2014). The Barents Sea region’s sea ice cover is declining at twice the rate of other arctic areas with a shortening of &gt;20 weeks having taken place in the last few decades (Laidre <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2015), so it is not surprising that the West Ice stock is the first to be heavily impacted.<br/><br/>The productivity of the ice-edge ecosystem is also dependent on the dynamics and seasonality of arctic ice, and alterations to the cycle of formation and retreat of the ice could be having negative effects on important Hooded Seal prey. For example, Polar cod abundance has declined markedly in the last decade in the Barents Region within a broad, rapid “borealization” of the fish community in this sector of the Arctic (Fossheim <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2015). Decreases in sea ice cover could also lead to more shipping and development of extraction based industries in the Arctic (gas, oil, mining, etc.) which in turn could negatively affect Hooded Seals through increased exposure to contaminants and pollution, increased disturbance, and increased risk of shipping accidents and spills (Pagnan 2000).<br/><br/>Predation by Polar Bears is thought to be an increasing issue of concern with respect to the West Ice stock’s conservation status. Polar Bear diets have shown an increase in Hooded Seal consumption by 9.5% per decade since the mid-1980s in East Greenland along with a concomitant decrease in the consumption of Ringed Seals (McKinney <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2013). These changes are likely primarily due to changes in sea ice distribution and extent (but could also reflect a declining Ringed Seal population).","Hooded Seal populations are usually assessed based on aerial survey counts of pups at whelping areas in the pack ice, combined with population models to extrapolate to total population size. In Canadian waters, pup production estimates for the Front have been: 1978—26,000 (Winters and Bergflodt 1978); 1984—62,400 (Bowen <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 1987); 1985—61,400 (Hay <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 1985); 1990—83,100 (Hammill <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 1992); and 2005—107,013 (Hammill and Stenson 2006). These figures indicate an increase of 5.2%/year during 1978-2005, 2.6%/year during 1984-2005, and 1.7%/year during 1990-2005. Pup production estimates for Gulf region in Canada have been: 1991—2,006 (Hammill <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 1992); 1998/99—2,000 (ICES 2001); and 2005—6,620 (Hammill and Stenson 2006). Comparing counts in 1991 and 2005 suggests that the number of animals in the Gulf increased by 8.5%/year during that period. Only two estimates are available for Davis Strait, 19,000 pups in 1984 (Bowen <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 1987) and 3,346 in 2005 (Hammill and Stenson 2006); this suggests a decline of 8.2%/year. Hammill and Stenson (2006, 2007) concluded that these estimates suggest a moderate increase both in pup production and population size between the mid 1980s and 2005 in the northwest Atlantic as a whole. Surveys carried out at all three whelping areas in 2005 produced an estimate of 116,900 pups born. The size of the whole population, modeled based on the pup counts, was estimated as 592,000 (Waring <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2007). No more recent survey information is available for the northwest Atlantic breeding areas (ICES 2013a) and the down-turn in the number of animals in the Davis Strait in the 2005 survey is concerning, especially given its magnitude and the continued high hunting levels of this species in West Greenland.<br/><br/>Hooded Seals in the West Ice have shown, and continue to show, a declining trend. Pup production estimates have been: 1997—23,762 (ICES 2013a); 2005—15,250 (Salberg <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2008); 2007—16,140 (ICES 2013a); and 2012—13,655 (Øigård <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2014). Comparing the estimates for 1997 and 2012 indicates a population decrease of 3.7%/year and a reduction in population size of 43% in 15 years (1.2 generations using the generation time of 12.8 years calculated by Pacifici <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2013). The most recent estimate of the total size of this population is 82,830 (SE=8,028) and models suggest a continued decline of approximately 7% per year in the coming decade (Øigård <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2014). This stock is less than 10% of its abundance observed some 60 years ago (ICES 2013a). Overhunting was clearly involved in the collapse of this stock as quotas were being set for a population size much larger than it actually was. However, the cause of the significant, on-going decline in this population is thought to be related to climate change induced alternation of its sea ice breeding habitat and increased predation by Polar Bears and Killer Whales in the pupping areas (Øigard <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2014) but prey availability might also be an issue.<br/><br/>Summing the most recent estimates for all stocks (three regions in the northwest Atlantic–2005; West Ice stock–2012) gives a total Hooded Seal population size estimate of approximately 675,000. However, with no recent surveys in Canada or Greenland this estimate cannot be considered reliable.<br/><br/>Available data show clearly that the Greenland Sea population has declined in recent years. With no surveys in the past 10 years, the trend for the northwestern stocks is unknown. Pup counts at the Front increased through until 2005, but with the rate of increase declining over time. With 15 years between surveys, it is possible that the population had peaked and started to decline before 2005. Since 2005, there have been several years with bad ice conditions when few Hooded Seals were sighted on the ice and it is not known whether any successful reproduction at all took place for the Gulf segment of the population (Stenson and Hammill 2014). Given the available data, the best estimate for the current population trend for Hooded Seals is -3.7%/year.<br/><br/>Because of their preference for heavy sea ice conditions for breeding, it is unlikely that Hooded Seals will continue to breed in their southern-most breeding areas in future. This species has been deemed one the most sensitive Arctic/subarctic marine mammal species to the impacts of climate change (Laidre <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2008).",Unknown,"Hooded Seals are found at high latitudes in the North Atlantic, and seasonally they extend their range north into the Arctic Ocean. They breed on pack ice and are associated with it much of the year, though they can spend significant periods of time pelagic, without hauling out (Lavigne and Kovacs 1988, Folkow and Blix 1999, Anderson <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2009, Folkow <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2010, Kovacs <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2011a). There are four major pupping areas: near the Magdalen Islands in the Gulf of Saint Lawrence, north of Newfoundland in an area known as the Front, in central Davis Strait, and in the West Ice in the Greenland Sea near the island of Jan Mayen (Sergeant 1974). Hooded Seals sometimes wander extensively; young animals have come ashore as far south as Portugal and the Canary Islands in Europe and south into the Caribbean in the West Atlantic (Kovacs and Lavigne 1986, Rice 1998). They have also been found outside the Atlantic Region, in the North Pacific and even as far south as California (Burns and Gavin 1980, Dudley 1992, Fay 1995). Since the mid 1990s, large numbers of vagrant Hooded Seals have been found outside the Arctic in some years (Mignucci-Giannoni and Haddow 2002, Harris and Gupta 2006). Stranded Hooded Seals are increasingly common on Sable Island, Canada, and along the New England coast and in the Saint Lawrence River area, particularly in years with sparse sea ice conditions (Harris <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2001, Lucas and Daoust 2002, Truchon <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2013).","Hooded Seals were subjected to intense commercial hunting in the 19th and 20th centuries. Harvests were often conducted in association with Harp Seal harvests and commercial fisheries for Greenland Sharks. Norway, the Soviet Union (now Russia), Canada, and Greenland have all been involved in the commercial harvests of this species. Following World War II the hunt was primarily focused on pups because of their highly prized blue-back pelt, however, many adult females were taken while defending their pups until killing of mothers in the breeding areas was prohibited in the various areas (Lavigne and Kovacs 1988).<br/><br/>The abundance estimate for Hooded Seals in the Northwest Atlantic is now a decade old; the last survey was conducted in 2005 (ICES 2013a), and the stock is now treated as a data-poor stock in terms of management protocols. Total allowable catch was set at 8,200 in 2007 and remained unchanged through to 2015 despite the lack of new information on stock sizes or trends in the region. However, Canadian catches are reported to be very low, some few 10s of animals per year.<br/><br/>Hooded Seals are also harvested in Greenland at a current level of a few thousand animals per year. It is assumed that most of those animals are from the northwest Atlantic breeding groups (Davis Strait, Gulf, and Front) given that most of the harvest takes place in West Greenland. However, some animals are also taken on the east coast of Greenland, and these animals are likely from the West Ice stock.<br/><br/>Hooded Seals have been harvested in the West Ice (Greenland Sea, north of Jan Mayen) for centuries. This hunt increased substantially after World War II, to levels that were clearly not sustainable. Regulatory measures were introduced in 1958 to reduce effort, and quotas were imposed in 1971 (Sergeant 1976, ICES 2006). Based on catch per unit effort analyses and mark-recapture pup production estimates it was assumed that the stock increased from the 1960s through to the 1990s at an unknown rate (Ulltang and Øien 1988). In hindsight this almost certainly was not the case (ICES 2013a). Aerial surveys in 1994 failed to produce an abundance estimate (Øritsland and Øien 1995). Recent modelling efforts suggest that a very substantial decrease in population abundance took place from the late 1940s up to the early 1980s (ICES 2006). This decline has continued through to the present and predictions suggest an ongoing decline of 7% over the coming decade (Øigård <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2014). Total pup production in this stock was estimated to be 24,000 in 1997 and this number dropped to 15,250 in 2005 (Salberg <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2008) and has continued to decline to 13,655 in 2012, despite a complete cessation of commercial harvesting (Øigård <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2014).",Terrestrial|Marine,"Numerous conservation measures, international management plans, harvest quotas, agreements, and treaties have been developed for the conservation of Hooded Seals dating back to the 1870s. Molting Seals in the Denmark Strait have been protected since 1961. Harvest quotas at Jan Mayen began in 1971. Hunting was banned in the Gulf of St. Lawrence in 1972 and quotas were placed on the rest of the Canadian harvest beginning in 1974. A European Economic Community ban on importation on Seal products in 1985 reduced the harvest of blueback Hooded Seals through the loss of the primary market for the furs (Lavigne and Kovacs 1988, Reeves <em>et al.</em> 1992). Greenlandic hunting is not limited, and might be at levels that are not sustainable, given deteriorating breeding conditions. The northeast Atlantic stock has experienced close to a 90% decline and the decline is ongoing. Population information for the northwest Atlantic is a decade old, leaving trends unknown for this segment of the population.<br/><br/>Based on population size, geographic range, habitat specificity, diet diversity, migration, site fidelity, sensitivity to changes in sea ice, sensitivity to changes in the trophic web, and maximum population growth potential Hooded Seals were rated to be among the top three arctic marine mammal species in terms of sensitivity to climate change (Laidre <em>et al.</em> 2008).

45225428,8010,Erignathus barbatus,Least Concern,,2016,2016-02-17 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"Due to its large population size, broad distribution, variable feeding habits, and no evidence of a current decline, the Bearded Seal are classified as Least Concern. However, Bearded Seals are very likely going to be negatively impacted by climate change, in particular because of losses of sea ice, and they should be monitored over the coming decades and reassessed as soon as more data become available.","<p>Bearded Seals are the largest northern phocid seal. Burns (1981) found that the average standard length of adults measured from the Bering/Chukchi region was 233 cm, with females slightly longer and substantially heavier than males. Maximum lengths were 233 cm for males and 243 cm for females and maximum weights were 262 kg and 360 kg. Newborn pups averaged 131 cm in length. Quakenbush <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> (2011) found an average asymptotic length of 219 cm for Bering/Chukchi samples from the 1970s, and 209 cm for samples from the 2000s. Cameron <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> (2010) report a maximum weight of 432 kg for a female collected in the Bering Sea in spring 1985. The Atlantic Bearded Seal is of similar size, and shares the slight sexual dimorphism, with females tending to be larger than males (Andersen <em>et al</em>. 1999, Kovacs and Lydersen 2006). Maximum mass recorded in Svalbard is for a female in spring that weighed 424 kg <br/> <br/> In Alaskan waters, sexual maturity is reached between 3 and 6 years in females, with an average of 4 years (Quakenbush <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2011). Males reach sexual maturity at 6-7 years (Burns 1981). In Svalbard, females reach sexual maturity at an age of 5 years, while males are 6 years of age when they are sexually mature though it is likely some years from that point before they compete successfully to breed (Andersen <em>et al</em>. 1999). Final body size in Bearded Seals is reached at approximately 9-10 years (McLaren 1958). Maximum longevity is likely 25-30 years (Cameron <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2010).</p><p>Bearded Seal pups are normally born on pack ice or small floes of annually-formed sea ice that fracture away from shore-fast ice as it breaks up in late spring (Kovacs <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 1996, Kovacs and Lydersen 2006). They also have been documented to use glacier ice pieces floating on the sea for birthing and nursing when forced to by the lack of availability of first-year sea ice (Lydersen <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2014). The large, precocial pups swim within hours of birth (Kovacs 2009). Peak birthing occurs between late March and mid-May, varying somewhat across the Bearded Seal’s range (Burns 1981, Kovacs 2009). Gjertz <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> (2000) estimated that in Svalbard pups are weaned in approximately 24 days. Nursing might be somewhat shorter for the Pacific subspecies, Burns (1981) suggested that pups are weaned at 12-18 days of age. Prior to weaning, their aquatic skills develop to the degree that they spend about half their time in the water, diving for up to 5.5 minutes to depths of up to 84 m (Lydersen <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 1994). Mothers spend over 80% of their time in the water while caring for a dependent pup (Lydersen and Kovacs 1999); about half that time is spent away from the neonate, presumably in foraging dives. Females haul-out to nurse their pups on average three times a day. The small amount of time mothers spend out of the water when pups are young is thought to be an adaptive response to Polar Bear predation; when only the pup is on the surface, the pair is less conspicuous to hunting bears (Krafft <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2000). Mating takes place at the end of lactation similar to other phocid seals. Males court females and display using elaborate downward trilling vocalizations that can travel many kilometres (Cleator <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 1989). Individual males use distinct songs, and occupy the same territories over a series of consecutive years within constraints imposed by variable ice conditions, or they show a roaming pattern (Van Parijs <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2001, 2003, 2004). Males exhibit aggression with each other during breeding, including bubble-blowing and physical combat so the mating system is presumably polygynous to some degree.<br/><br/>Bearded seals have an extended moulting period and animals can be found shedding hair from April to August, though there appears to be a peak in May/June for both subspecies (Burns 1981, Gjertz <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2000).&#160; During the moult they spend much of their time hauled out and are reluctant to enter the water (Kovacs and Lydersen 2006). Bearded seals use sea ice as a haulout platform on a year-round basis whenever it is available, preferring small and medium sized floes and generally avoiding large floes (Simpkins <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2003). However, they will haul out on land in the summer in the absence of sea ice (e.g., Burns 1981, Merkel <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2013).&#160; They are rarely found more than a body length from access to water even if hauled out on land (Kovacs 2009).<br/><br/>Bearded Seals naturally occur at quite low densities (Bengtson <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2005); they are typically solitary animals, but they do form small, loose aggregations at times (Burns 1981). <br/><br/>Studies conducted on Atlantic Bearded Seal lactating females and pups (Gjertz <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2000, Krafft <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2000) have shown that diving depths largely reflect local bathymetry in coastal areas.&#160; This reflects their benthic foraging habits; Bearded Seals feed primarily on or near the bottom and most diving is to depths of less than 100 m (though dives of adults have been recorded up to 300 m and young-of-the-year have been recorded diving down to almost 500 m; Gjertz <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2000). They use their elaborate whiskers to search for food items on and in soft bottom substrates and have powerful suction abilities to extract prey (Marshall <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2006, 2008). The diet of Bearded Seals varies by age, location, and season (Lowry <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 1980). Polar Cod (<em>Boreogadis saida</em>), Sculpins, Spider Crab, and Shrimps (<em>Sabinea sptemcarinatus </em>and <em>Sclerocrangon boreas</em>) are the most frequent prey items in Svalbard (Hjelset <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 1999). However, Cod, other demersal fish, and worms are also regular components of the diet in this area. A wide variety of prey has been reported from the Okhotsk Sea, with Crabs, Shrimps, Clams, Snails, and Worms accounting for most of their diet (Burns 1981). Quakenbush <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> (2011) analyzed the frequency of occurrence of prey in 943 Bearded Seal stomachs collected from the Bering and Chukchi Seas during 1960-2009 and identified 213 different prey taxa. The most commonly eaten groups were Crabs, Shrimps, Clams, Snails, benthic and demersal fishes, and echiuroid worms. These authors found a significant increase in consumption of gadid fishes, principally Arctic Cod (<em>Boreogadus saida</em>) and Saffron Cod (<em>Eleginus gracilis</em>), from the 1960s to the 2000s.</p><p>Bearded Seals are preyed upon by Polar Bears, Killer Whales, Greenland Sharks, and Pacific Walruses (Lowry and Fay 1984, Lowry <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 1987, Kovacs and Lydersen 2006).</p>","Global climate warming is currently causing major reductions in the extent and duration of sea ice cover in the Arctic, creating a threat to many species of ice-associated marine mammals. Pinnipeds such as the Bearded Seal that are dependent on sea ice for pupping, moulting, resting, and access to foraging areas, may be especially vulnerable to such changes (Laidre <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2008, 2015; Kovacs 2011, 2012). In 2012, Bearded Seals were listed under the US Endangered Species Act following a detailed review of their status and threats (Cameron <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2010) because of the threats posed from climate change induced losses in sea ice and ocean acidification due to climate warming, as well as increasing industrial activities in a more ice-free Arctic (Federal Register 2012). Increasing development and industrialization of the Arctic may threaten Bearded Seals in several ways. Oil spills from offshore extraction and transportation could negatively affect them through direct contact with oil and damage to foraging areas and stocks of prey, particularly benthic invertebrates, that are vulnerable to oil contamination. An increase in human-created noise in the arctic environment could cause marine mammals, including Bearded Seals that are very vocal during their breeding season, to abandon areas of habitat they otherwise might use. Increased shipping will pose a greater threat of marine accidents and disturbance of marine mammals. Cameron <em><em>et al.</em></em> (2010) concluded that these factors could constitute low to moderate threats to Bearded Seals.<br/><br/>Hunting by indigenous peoples continues throughout most of the species range. There is no evidence of any impact from hunting on Bearded Seal population numbers. For example, reports from Alaska Native subsistence hunters do not give any indication that Bearded Seal numbers have declined (Quakenbush <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2011).","Population sizes and trends are unknown for all populations of the Atlantic Bearded Seal (see Laidre <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2015 for a summary). An estimate for Canadian waters of 190,000 animals was suggested by Cleator (1996), based on data collected over a 35-year period, but this number is really an educated guess as opposed to an actual estimate and in any case is now dated. The Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada more recently assessed the status of this species in Canada as being data deficient (COSEWIC 2007). They are also listed on Greenland’s Red List as being data deficient (Boertmann 2007). There have never been any surveys for Bearded Seals in Norwegian waters (Kovacs and Lydersen 2006) or Russian territories in the Atlantic Arctic (Reijnders <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 1993). However, recordings of their distinctive breeding calls via passive acoustic monitoring networks suggest that this species remains widespread and relatively numerous in the Atlantic Arctic (e.g., Moore <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2012).<br/><br/>Population data are also incomplete for Pacific Bearded Seals, but this subspecies has received considerably more survey effort. Cameron <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> (2010) concluded that the best estimate for the Okhotsk Sea is 95,000 based on data from 1990 (Fedoseev 2000), and that there are no useful abundance estimates for the East Siberian and Beaufort Seas. Aerial surveys in 1999-2000 estimated about 27,000 Bearded Seals in the Alaskan Chukchi Sea. In the Bering Sea, surveys having been conducted by the USA and the Soviet Union/Russia starting in the 1970s. Early efforts, which covered varying areas and used a variety of methods, suggested an abundance of 50,000-100,000 Bearded Seals in the region. More recently, Ver Hoef <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> (2014) analyzed line transect survey data collected in the Bering Sea in spring 2007 using a series of models and estimated there were 61,800 Bearded Seals (95% CI 34,900–171,600) in their study area. Because that study included about half of the available sea ice habitat, Cameron <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> (2010) considered that the total Bearded Seal population in the Bering Sea was about 125,000. It is likely that the total abundance of Pacific Bearded Seals, including the Okhotsk Sea, is at least 250,000.<br/><br/>The global population size of Bearded Seals is unknown. Current population trends are also unknown.",Unknown,"Bearded Seals have a patchy circumpolar distribution throughout much of the Arctic and sub-Arctic, south of 85ºN.&#160;In the Pacific sector they range from the Arctic Ocean south through the East Siberian, Beaufort, Chukchi, and Bering Seas (Burns 1981).&#160;They also occupy all of Hudson Bay and much of the eastern Canadian Archipelago south to southern Labrador, and both coasts of Greenland. They occur along the north shore of Iceland, within the Svalbard Archipelago, in the drifting pack ice of the Barents Sea and across much of the north coast of the Russian Federation (Kovacs 2009). Bearded Seal vagrants have been reported from many locations outside the Arctic including Portugal (van Bree 2000), the Gulf of Saint Lawrence, northern Newfoundland, and Massachusetts&#160;(Gosselin and Boily 1994)&#160;in the North Atlantic, as well as in Japan and China in the North Pacific (Rice 1998).<br/> <br/> Bearded Seals are strongly associated with sea ice and are benthic feeders, and these two attributes explain much of their seasonal movement patterns and their general distribution. While they are not strictly migratory, Bearded Seals in the Bering-Chukchi region undergo seasonal movements linked with the advance and retreat of sea ice (Burns 1981, Cameron <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2010). However, in some other regions they are quite sedentary throughout the year, such as in Svalbard, Norway (Kovacs and Lydersen 2006).","<p></p><p>Indigenous peoples of the Arctic have hunted Bearded Seals for subsistence for thousands of years, a practice that continues today throughout much of the species’ range. However, levels of subsistence harvest are not well known. Subsistence harvests of Bearded Seals in Alaska were estimated to average approximately 6,800/year during 1990-1998 (Allen and Angliss 2010). Some animals are struck and lost, especially from late spring to mid summer when they are thinnest, and if those animals are accounted for the annual Alaska harvest could be as high as 10,000. An additional 1,000-2,000 may be taken by coastal hunters in Chukotka (Cameron <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2010). Subsistence harvest levels are not closely monitored in Canada, but Cleator (1996) estimated that roughly 2,400 Bearded Seals were taken per year. In Greenland Bearded Seals make up only 1-2% of the Seal catch (Garde 2013), with some few hundred taken annually. Bearded Seals are hunted at low levels in Svalbard currently, but during the whaling period individual boats would take hundreds. They are also harvested in the White Sea.<br/> <br/> The former Soviet Union historically conducted ship-based commercial harvests of Bearded Seals in the North Pacific region, in the Bering, Chukchi, and Okhotsk Seas. Harvests grew from 9,000 to 13,000 for the Bering and Okhotsk seas combined during 1957-1964, and were 8,000 to 10,000 per year during 1964-1967 (Reeves <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1992). Ship-based harvests were suspended from 1970 to 1975, and took place at lower levels when they resumed (Kelly 1988). There is currently no significant commercial harvest of Bearded Seals in Russia.</p>",Terrestrial|Marine,"Within the USA, the Marine Mammal Protection Act generally prohibits taking of Bearded Seals unless it is by an Alaska Native for subsistence or production of handicrafts. In 2012, Bearded Seals in the Bering-Chukchi and Okhotsk Seas were listed as threatened under the US Endangered Species Act (Federal Register 2012). In Canada, subsistence hunting of Bearded Seals is co-managed by the Department of Fisheries and Oceans and regional resource boards (Cameron <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2010). Licensed hunters can shoot Bearded Seals in Svalbard, outside protected areas and during open seasons, that are set in periods when Bearded Seals shot in the water are least likely to sink (Kovacs and Lydersen 2006). In Russia, the “Law of Fisheries and Preservation of Aquatic Resources” provides for subsistence harvest of Seals by aboriginal Russian peoples, and a total allowable catch is determined annually. Russia is the only nation to set a quota on the number of Bearded Seals that can be harvested, it is an “open” hunt in all other regions.<br/><br/>Bearded Seals are able to use glacier ice pieces that have calved into the sea as haul-out platforms, so tidal glacier fronts are increasingly important to them in areas where sea ice declines are marked (Lydersen <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2014). Tidal glacier fjords may represent important breeding refugias in the future as sea ice continues to decline and this habitat type should be considered for special conservation status.",Nearctic|Palearctic,,false,false,Global
45226042,9660,Halichoerus grypus,Least Concern,,2016,2016-03-01 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The Grey Seal has the same geographic distribution as in the late 19th century with areas of its range having been recolonized over the past 30-40 years. Their abundance has increased in all regions in the past several decades. Total abundance globally is more than 600,000. Changes in juvenile survival and pup production suggest that some colonies may be approaching a resource ceiling. Grey Seals do not meet IUCN criteria for any threatened category and are listed as Least Concern.","Grey Seals are a large sexually dimorphic phocid. Northwest Atlantic Grey Seals are significantly larger than Northeast Atlantic animals. In the UK, adult males are on average 2 m long and weigh 233 kg, with a maximum of 310 kg. Adult females average 1.8 m and 155 kg. At birth, pups are 90-105 cm, with male pups averaging 15.8 kg in weight and female pups averaging 14.8 kg (Bonner 1981). Weaning weights average 40 kg for males and 35.8-39.6 kg for females. In the Western Atlantic adult males are on average 2.1 m long and weigh 267 kg, with a maximum of 370 kg (Bowen unpub. data). Adult females average 1.9 m in length and weigh 186 kg with a maximum of 256 kg (Iverson <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 1993). Newborn pups average 16.6 kg or about 14% of maternal body mass (Mellish <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 1999). In North America, pups are heavier at birth than pups born in the UK and are 25% heavier at weaning. At the time of weaning, male pups average 56.2 kg and females 51.6 kg, as measured for pups born on the ice near Amet Island (Haller <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 1996). Male pups weigh 56.6 and females weigh 54.5 kg for those born on land at Sable Island (Bowen <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2006). Baltic Grey Seal pups weigh about 12 kg at birth, but weaning mass differs between ice-born pups (48.3 kg) and those born on land (37.4 kg) (Jüssi <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2008). Survival to recruitment to the breeding population is positively related to pup size at weaning (Bowen <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2015).<br/><br/>Lactation lasts around 15-18 days on average, with ice breeders having slightly shorter lactation periods; weaning is abrupt (Kovacs 1987, Haller <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 1996, Bowen <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2006). Pre-weaning mortality of Grey Seal pups varies widely between colonies; it is usually between 5 and 20% but can be as high as 30% (Bowen <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2007, Hammill <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2014). Pup mortality rates are influenced by habitat quality, birth site, quality of maternal care, injuries resulting from male-male aggression, and to a lesser extent predation by Greater and Lesser Black-backed Gulls (<em>Larus marinus </em>and <em>L. fuscus</em>) on weakened, unprotected, pups, or pups born on the periphery of a colony (Baker and Baker 1988, Twiss <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2003).<br/><br/>In the Baltic, pre-weaning mortality is low for pups born on ice, but varies between 5 and 30% on land, depending on pupping density (Jüssi <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2008). The main predators in this region are White-tailed Eagles (<em>Haliaeetus albicilla</em>) and Greater Black-backed Gulls.<br/><br/>In the UK, females give birth on land and show considerable site fidelity (Pomeroy <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 1994), although this is not observed elsewhere. Mothers typically stay with their pups until weaning (Boness and James 1979), but are rarely more than a few meters away from water at some UK colonies (Twiss <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 1994). Reproductive performance of adult females varies with age and body mass. Females in their late 20s and older show evidence of reduced reproductive success, caused by senescence (Bowen <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2006).<br/><br/>In the Gulf of St Lawrence, lactating females that give birth on the ice spend about 72% of their time hauled out, nursing the pup every 2-3 hours. From the time of birth until weaning, females lose about 5.7 kg per day (Lydersen <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 1994). Females in the UK lose an average of 65 kg over the lactation period (Fedak and Anderson 1982), whereas the somewhat larger females in the Northwest Atlantic lose an average of 75 kg (Haller <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 1996, Mellish <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 1999). Females come into estrus around the time of weaning (Boness <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 1982). Females are at their lowest weight following the moulting period, averaging 126.2 kg in Canadian colonies; by the beginning of the next pupping period they again average 210 kg (Beck <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2003a).<br/><br/>Adult male Grey Seals come ashore about the time the first pups are born (Boness and James 1979, Bonner 1981). Their average age when first returning to their breeding colonies is 9-10 years at Sable Island (Manske <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2002). Males spend large amounts of time out of the water fasting during the breeding season. Some males go to sea for periods of 2-3 days while others remain hauled out for the entire breeding season (Lidgard <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2003). Males do not defend a fixed territory, but stay near a particular group of females (Lidgard <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2001). Breeding age males lose less weight per day than lactating females, but because they are ashore for an average of 36 days, up to an extreme of 57days, they can experience considerable loss of mass (Anderson and Fedak 1985, Lidgard <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2005, Tinker <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 1995).<br/><br/>Pupping dates differ significantly between populations: peak dates in the Northwest Atlantic are in January; in the Northeast Atlantic peak dates vary between September and December in different subpopulations; and in the Baltic Sea peak pupping is in late February to early March, which coincides with the annual maximum ice coverage. The differences in pupping seasons probably keep the groups reproductively isolated (Bonner 1981). Pups are born on land in the Northeast Atlantic, and can be born on either ice or land in the Northwest Atlantic and in the Baltic (Bonner 1981, Baker <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 1995). Pups are born with a woolly white lanugo that is moulted around the time of weaning. Pups stay on land from birth until the moult is finished (Noren <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2008), although some pups on small exposed beaches often swim for short periods even before moulting (Kovacs 1987). During the post weaning fast pups lose up to 25% of their body mass (Noren <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2008). In the United Kingdom, adult females moult from mid-January to mid-February, and males moult from mid-February through early April. In Canada, the moult is later in the spring, with females moulting in May-June and males about a month later (Beck <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2003a). Peak moulting season for Baltic seals is the last week of May to the second week in June.<br/><br/>Grey Seals are shallow, short-duration divers. Most adult diving is shallower than 120 m and shorter than 8 min. (Beck <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2003b). Female’s dives are on average slightly longer (5.5 min.) than those of males (4.9 min.), although males tend to dive somewhat deeper (57 m compared to 49 m) (Beck <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2003b). On the Scotian Shelf, maximum dives recorded were 412 m for males, and 354 m for females (Beck <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2003b). Typically in the UK, dives are shorter and shallower (average 4-10 min., maximum 30 min.). In European waters Grey Seals are primarily demersal feeders, diving to the seabed during most dives (usually 60 m, but down to 200 m in some areas; Thompson <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 1991).<br/><br/>Grey Seals are not long-distance migrants. In Europe, tracking of individual seals has shown that they can feed up to several hundred kilometres offshore during short foraging trips lasting 2.3 days on average (McConnell <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 1999). Individual Grey Seals, based at specific haulout sites, often make repeated trips to the same region offshore but will occasionally move to a new haulout and begin foraging in a new region. Movements of Grey Seals between haul-outs in the North Sea and the Shetland Isles, Outer Hebrides, and Faeroe Islands have been recorded. During foraging trips Grey Seals often target areas with fine gravel/coarse sandy sea-bed sediments, which are the preferred habitat of Sandeels (<em>Ammodytes </em>sp.), an important part of the Grey Seal’s diet.<br/><br/>Satellite telemetry data from Canada show that Grey Seals there perform much longer foraging trips (averaging 5-12 days) and often travel much larger distances than European Grey Seals (Breed <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2009). Foraging trip characteristics differ seasonally and by sex. Females typically fed closer to haulouts than males and spent more time foraging at these patches (Breed <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2009). Grey Seals in Canada also exhibit pronounced seasonal sex segregation in foraging distribution (Breed <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2006). In the Baltic Sea, Grey Seals make short feeding trips, spending roughly 75% of their time within 50 km of haulout sites (Sjøberg and Ball 2000).<br/><br/>Grey Seals are generalist predators, consuming a wide range of species, although typically fewer than 10 species comprise most of the diet (Bowen and Siniff 1999). Grey Seal diet varies by seasonally and location, though they are largely demersal or benthic feeders (Bowen <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 1993, Hall 2002). At times in Canada and the North Sea, the food consumed by Grey Seals can be over 50% Sandeels, although several dozen species are eaten (Bowen and Harrison 1994, Hammond <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 1994, Beck <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2007). In Iceland, where 15 species make up the majority of the diet, the most common stomach contents by weight are Atlantic Cod (<em>Gadus morhua</em>) 24%, Sandeels 23%, Catfish (Wolf-fish <em>Anarhichas lupus</em>) 15%, and Saithe (<em>Pollachius virens</em>) 11% (Hauksson and Bogason 1997). At the Faroes, adults feed on Cod and Catfish, subadults feed on Sandeels and Saithe, and juveniles consume Sandeels (Mikkelsen <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2002). In the United Kingdom, Sandeels, Cod, and Dover Sole (<em>Solea solea</em>) account for 56% of the diet by weight. Grey Seals also eat other flatfish, including Dab (<em>Limanda limanda</em>), Flounder (<em>Platichthys plessus</em>), and Plaice (<em>Pleuronectes platessa</em>) (Prime and Hammond 1990). In the Outer Hebrides, gadids account for 40% or more of the diet (Ling, Molva molva), Atlantic Cod, and Whiting (<em>Merlangius merlangus</em>); Sandeels are less important in this area (Hammond <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 1994). In Canada, the dominant prey species consumed by Seals differs by season, sex, and age-class; however, Sandeels and Redfish (<em>Sebastes </em>sp.) together accounted for 40-91% of the diet in all seasons, sexes, and age-classes (Bowen and Harrison 1994). Pollock (<em>Pollachius virens</em>), and flounders (Turbot <em>Reinhardtius</em> <em>hippoglossoides</em>, Witch <em>Glyptocephalus cynoglossus</em>, and Yellowtail <em>Limanda ferruginea</em>) account for more than 10% of the diet in some demographic groups within seasons (Beck <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2007). Atlantic Cod can be an important part of the diet in some areas and seasons (Hammill <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2014).","Grey Seals have been important in subsistence harvests in coastal areas within their range throughout history. They have been hunted in the Baltic Sea for more than 10,000 years (Härkönen <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2005). Commercial harvesting has been ongoing in many areas for hundreds of years, and at times Grey Seals have been important to local economies (Mansfield 1988). Over-harvesting in the Baltic in the early 20th century led to a large decline; this population once numbered somewhere between 80,000 and 100,000, but was reduced to about 20,000 in the 1940s. A further decline to 1,500-2,000 seals was caused by high loads of PCB (Harding and Härkönen 1999).<br/><br/>Government culls, bounties and licensed kills for protection of fishing gear have been put into effect in many countries and continue to be used to control Grey Seal numbers and reduce their impact on commercially important coastal fisheries (i.e., salmonid fisheries). Grey Seals feed on a number of commercial species, and by damaging nets and traps they are in direct conflict with fisheries. They also are vectors for parasites that can have an impact on the economics of some fisheries (ICES 2005).<br/><br/>Entanglement in commercial fishing nets causes by-catch mortality in most parts of the Grey Seals’ range (Woodley and Lavigne 1991). By-catch levels are approximately 300 per year in Swedish fisheries in the Baltic (ICES 2005). A Norwegian study from 1975-1998 reported the death of 259 seals, primarily juveniles less than a year old, which represented 7% of the tagged animals in the region (Bjørge <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2002). Among 528 deaths of tagged seals in the UK, 148 were attributable to fishing nets. However, this may overestimate the rate of entanglement-related mortality due to the high rate of tag returns from fisheries. Woodley and Lavigne (1991) suggested that 1-2% of animals less than a year old die in fishing gear. More recent photographic analysis of Grey Seals at haulout sites on Cape Cod, Massachusetts revealed 5-8% of Seals exhibited signs of entanglement (Sette <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2009). Finally, in the US commercial fisheries there was an average annual mortality of 853 Grey Seals reported for the period 2006-2010 (Waring <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2013). For the period 2008-2012, the total estimated human caused mortality (and serious injury to) Grey Seals was 4,533 per year of which about 1,000 were taken in US observed fisheries, about 400 in the Canadian hunt, 90 taken by the Department of Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO) in scientific collections, and about 3,000 were killings of nuisance animals in Canada (DFO 2011).<br/><br/>Grey Seals are known carriers of phocine distemper virus (PDV), in all populations (Ross <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1992, Duignan <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1995, Härkönen <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2006). However, they have suffered almost no mortality from the disease, in marked contrast to Harbour Seals. Härkönen <em><em>et al.</em></em> (2006) report Grey Seal mortality of approximately 230 (equal to 1% of the Harbour Seal mortality) in the 1988 epizootic in Europe and the death of 30 Grey Seal pups in the Baltic were attributed to PDV. Because Grey Seals haulout with Harbour Seals in the Wadden Sea and are known to travel more widely than the more sedentary Harbour Seal, it is presumed that they had a role in the outbreak and spread of the 2002 epizootic of PDV in Harbour Seals (Härkönen <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2006).<br/><br/>Grey Seals are exposed to agricultural pollutants through the food chain in their coastal ranges. PCBs and DDT contaminant loads are extremely high in Baltic Grey Seals, despite the fact that tissue burdens have declined since the 1970s. Analysis of samples collected from 1996 to 1998 indicated that Grey Seals still have a very heavy load of contaminants when compared to other Seals outside the Baltic (ICES 2005).<br/><br/>Health effects on Grey Seals have been suggested to be linked to their high exposures to PCBs and DDT. Baltic Grey Seals have a relatively high rate of colonic ulcers associated with hookworm infestations, which are sometimes fatal. This condition is not found elsewhere (ICES 2005). Uterine stenosis and a host of other pathologies in other organs have been attributed to long-term exposure to environmental toxics, particularly in older Baltic Grey Seals. These are specifically linked to reproductive and population declines for this subspecies and are conditions not seen in other populations (Bergman <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2001). However, no negative effects have been attributed to heavy metal contaminants in Baltic Grey Seals (Bergman <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2001, ICES 2005).<br/><br/>Grey Seals live close to human population centres and shipping lanes and spend much of their time in the vicinity of favourite haulout locations. Spilled oil from vessel accidents and other sources have fouled Grey Seal sites since at least the 1940s (St. Aubin 1990). Despite numerous records of oiled animals and occasional reports of dead animals coated in oil, or animals having ingested oil, it has not been determined whether those mortalities are attributable to contact with oil (St. Aubin 1990).","Available data on Grey Seal abundance were compiled and reviewed in the 2016 IUCN Red List assessments for the two recognized subspecies. Estimates of the number of mature individuals, and population trend, were as follows: Northeast Atlantic Grey Seal 66,000, increasing; Northwest Atlantic Grey Seal 250,000, increasing. The world-wide population of Grey Seals is estimated to contain about 316,000 mature individuals and the total population size is about 632,000.",Increasing,"Grey Seals have a cold temperate to sub-Arctic distribution in North Atlantic waters over the continental shelf (Hall 2002). There are three populations isolated both geographically and by the timing of reproduction (Bonner 1981); mtDNA differences are large between these three breeding areas, though the Baltic and Northeast Atlantic populations are much closer to one another than to the Northwest Atlantic population (Boskovic <em>et al</em>. 1996). In the western Atlantic, the population is centered on the eastern Scotian Shelf off northeastern North America, but the Grey Seal ranges from the Gulf of Maine to southern Labrador, including the Gulf of St Lawrence (Lesage and Hammill 2001). The northeast Atlantic population is concentrated around the UK and Ireland but is also found around Iceland, the Faroe Islands, and along the European mainland coast from the Kola Peninsula south to southern Norway, and from Denmark to Brittany in France. The Baltic Sea subpopulation is confined to the Baltic Sea (Bonner 1981, Hall 2002). Vagrants are known from as far south as New Jersey in the western Atlantic and Portugal in the eastern Atlantic (Rice 1998).","Grey Seals have been important in subsistence harvests in coastal areas within their range throughout history. Grey Seals are protected in the USA under the Marine Mammal Protection Act and in Canada under the Fisheries Act. Nevertheless, there is a management plan that permits commercial harvesting of Grey Seals in Canadian waters, although relatively few Seals are taken each year. Grey Seal pups were taken in Orkney until the early 1980s, partly for commercial exploitation and partly as a population control measure. Large-scale culls of Grey Seals in the North Sea, Orkney, and Hebrides were carried out in the 1960s and 1970s as population control measures.<br/><br/>In Norway, hunting quotas are set within the context of a Grey Seal management plan and bounties have also been paid to reduce numbers in areas where there are conflicts with fisheries (Nilssen and Haug 2007). Hunting of Grey Seals is also permitted in Iceland (Hauksson 2007). In the Faroe Islands, licenses to kill Grey Seals are issued for the purpose of protecting marine fish farming (Mikkelsen 2007).",Terrestrial|Marine,"Numerous countries have invoked protective measures to limit Grey Seal harvests, culls, disturbance, and by-catch (Bonner 1981, ICES 2005). Pollutant loads in Baltic Grey Seals have declined following regulations banning the use and discharge of toxic pollutants such as DDT and PCBs beginning in the 1970s. Although the prevalence of colonic ulcers has increased over the last decades, the reproductive health of female Grey Seals has improved as has the population level in the Baltic (Bergman <em>et al</em>. 2001). Establishment of coastal marine reserves for Seals in Norway have been more effective in protecting Harbour Seals than Grey Seals because the latter are more likely to travel outside the areas closed to fisheries and become entangled in nets (Bjørge <em>et al</em>. 2002).",Nearctic|Palearctic,,false,false,Global

There is no indication of a declining trend in the population, although abundance estimates have considerable uncertainty around them and consequently trend is unknown. Leopard Seals depend on sea ice for reproduction and at some time in the future they could be adversely affected by a reduction in sea ice due to continued climate warming. Leopard Seals are currently a widespread and abundant species that does not qualify for any of the IUCN threatened categories, and they should be listed as Least Concern.","Adult male Leopard Seals are 2.8 to 3.3 m long and weigh up to 300 kg. Adult females are 2.9 to 3.6 m, with very large animals possibly reaching 3.8 m, and weights of 260 to upwards of 500 kg. Pups are 1.0 to 1.6 m in length and weigh 30 to 35 kg at birth. The age at sexual maturity is probably four years for females and 4.5 years for males. Longevity is estimated to be over 26 years (Kooyman 1981, Rogers 2009). <br/><br/>At sea and on the ice, Leopard Seals tend to be solitary. Pups are born on sea ice from early November to late December and the period may be as long as early October to early January (Southwell <em>et al</em>. 2003). Births at South Georgia occur from late August to the middle of September. Pups are probably weaned at four weeks old, and female oestrous occurs at or shortly after weaning. Unlike Crabeater Seals, male Leopard Seals do not haul out with female-pup pairs. Mating is believed to occur in the water, but has never been observed.<br/><br/>Leopard Seals are well known for preying upon penguins. However, their diet is in reality highly varied and changes with seasonal and local abundance of prey. Leopard Seals will consume krill, fish, squid, penguins, a variety of other types of seabirds, and juvenile seals including Crabeater, Southern Elephant and Fur Seals (Rogers 2009, Southwell <em>et al</em>. 2012). In the case of Antarctic Fur Seals, it has been proposed that predation of Leopard Seals on pups might have a significant role in driving population dynamics of the prey species in certain areas (Schwarz <em>et al</em>. 2013). Most prey are caught in the water. Penguins are usually held in the Leopard Seal's teeth by one end and slung in an arc with a rapid snap of the head and neck and smashed on the surface of the water until they are torn open. Smaller pieces are then swallowed. Young, newly fledged naïve penguins are most vulnerable, but adult birds are taken as well. Leopard Seals patrol and regularly station themselves just off Penguin colonies and wait to ambush and chase animals transiting to and from the colonies (Rogers and Bryden 1995).&#160; Krill may be a seasonally important prey (Lowry <em>et al</em>. 1988). <br/><br/>There have been few studies of Leopard Seal diving. Two seals tagged with satellite-linked dive recorders&#160;dove&#160;mostly to 10-50 m, and the deepest dive recorded was 304 m (Nordøy and Blix 2009).","There are currently no major threats from human activity within the species’ normal range.&#160;<br/><br/>Learmonth <em>et al</em>. (2006) list the effects of global climate change on Leopard Seals as unknown. However, loss of sufficient areas of pack ice habitat suitable for pupping, resting and avoidance of predators, and availability of preferred prey such as Penguins, other Seals, Krill and fish that might all possibly decline, could effect Leopard Seals directly or indirectly to an unknown degree. The effects of loss of large amounts of ice on the Antarctic continent, general climate warming, or sea level rises, on Antarctic ocean circulation and productivity and on Antarctic marine resources such as Seals are unknown.&#160;Siniff <em>et al</em>. (2008) suggested that similar to Crabeater Seals, Leopard Seals would be less affected by changes in sea ice than Ross or Weddell Seals. <br/><br/>Two species of Antarctic ice seals, Leopard and Crabeater, have tested positive for antibodies to canine distemper virus (CDV). The effects of an outbreak of this or other diseases on Leopard Seals either as a disease within this species, or repeatedly transmitted to it from an outbreak in a prey species such as the Crabeater Seal, are unknown. Leopard Seals are generally solitary except when females attend their pup or when pairs mate, so transmission of disease within the species would likely be slow or only seasonally significant. CDV is believed to have arrived in the Antarctic with sled dogs before the advent of vaccines. A mass mortality of Crabeater Seals occurred in 1955, with many animals displaying viral illness symptoms prior to death, but the exact cause of death is unknown (Bengtson and Boveng 1991).<br/><br/>Seasonal tourism in the Antarctic and Sub-Antarctic has increased steadily in the last 30 plus years, and is currently at all-time high levels. The effects of increased vessel noise, disturbance from vessels passage, and close approaches by people in small boats and on land on Leopard Seal behaviour, distribution and foraging are unknown. There is also a risk of injury to a small number of animals from collision with boats or crushing from large vessels passing through ice fields.<br/><br/>There are no reports of significant fisheries interactions. Commercial harvest of Krill may pose direct or indirect threats to Leopard Seals, if conducted on a large scale.","The Leopard Seal is a widespread species and, similar to the other Antarctic seals that inhabit the pack ice, population assessments are very difficult and expensive to conduct and therefore undertaken infrequently. Published global population estimates from many decades ago range from 100,000-300,000 (Scheffer 1958) up to 220,000-440,000 animals (Laws 1984). However, these early estimates were based on very limited sampling and were highly speculative. An analysis of ship and aerial sighting surveys carried out around the continent between 1968 and 1983 provided a point estimate for global Leopard Seal population size in the pelagic pack ice of the Southern Ocean of 300,000 animals (Erickson and Hanson 1990). The most ambitious and coordinated effort to date, the Antarctic Pack-Ice Seal (APIS) project, conducted aerial and shipboard surveys around the continent during 1996-2001, and also included deployment of satellite-linked dive recorders to investigate haulout behaviour. APIS surveys resulted in an estimate of 35,500 (95% CL 10,900-102,600) Leopard Seals in the surveyed areas (Southwell <em>et al</em>. 2012). All estimates have considerable uncertainty associated with them, and only very large changes in Leopard Seal population size could be confidently detected from repeated surveys (Southwell <em>et al</em>. 2008).",Unknown,"Leopard Seals are widely distributed in Antarctic and sub-Antarctic waters of the Southern Hemisphere, occurring from the coast of the Antarctic continent northward throughout the pack ice and at most sub-Antarctic islands. There is a seasonal presence of juveniles at Kerguelen and Macquarie Islands with the greatest numbers being sighted in September and October (Rounseveld and Eberhard 1980,&#160;Borsa 1990). Vagrants regularly reach warm temperate latitudes.&#160;Leopard Seals&#160;haul out on ice and on land, often preferring ice floes near shore when they are available (Kooyman 1981).","Small numbers of Leopard Seals have been taken for research purposes and some were previously killed for dog food, but otherwise there is no current or past significant catch of this species (Reijnders&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1993).",Terrestrial|Marine,"The Leopard Seal is not listed as endangered or threatened on any national Red List.

45226918,12246,Lobodon carcinophaga,Least Concern,,2015,2014-12-01 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"Due to its widespread occurrence and very large population size, the Crabeater Seal should remain classified by IUCN as Least Concern.","Adult Crabeater Seals reach 2.6 m in length and weigh an estimated 200-300 kg. Neonates are thought to be at least 1.1 m and 20-40 kg. The mean age of sexual maturity in females varies from 2.5 to 4.2 years and these variations may be related to changes in food abundance (Bengtson and Laws 1985,&#160;Hårding and Härkönen 1995). Annual adult mortality is about 3-10% (Boveng 1993). Crabeater Seal births occur mainly during the second half of October. They do not use specific rookeries. Instead, adult females haul out singly on an ice floe where they give birth, and they are joined by a male shortly after (Siniff <em>et al</em>. 1979, Adam 2005). Adult males attend female-pup pairs and stay with the female until her oestrous begins one to two weeks after the pup is weaned. Mating has not been witnessed and presumably occurs in the water.<br/><br/>Pups are born from September to December (Southwell <em>et al</em>. 2003) in a soft woolly coat that is greyish-brown in colour and has been described as light, milk coffee brown, with darker colouring on the flippers. Adult females fast during lactation, and wean their pups after an average of three weeks (Southwell 2004, Adam 2005) at which time pups are moulting from the lanugo coat into a sub-adult pelage similar to that of the adult. Adults and subadults moult in January and February, and a large proportion of the animals in an area are thought to be hauled out during the annual moult.<br/><br/>Mortality is high in the first year, possibly reaching 80%. Much of this mortality is attributed to Leopard Seal predation, and up to 78% of Crabeaters that survive through their first year have injuries and scars from Leopard Seal attacks (Siniff and Bengtson 1997). The presence of long scars and sets of parallel scars that are readily visible on the pale, relatively unmarked pelage of Crabeaters, are testimony to the frequency of these attacks on young of this species. Leopard Seal attacks appear to fall off dramatically after Crabeaters reach one year of age (Siniff and Stone 1985).<br/><br/>Recent research has revealed that Crabeater Seals can dive up to 600 m and stay submerged for 24 minutes, although most feeding dives occur within the top 50 m, and are shorter in duration (Burns <em>et al</em>. 2004, 2008). Foraging occurs primarily at night (Bengtson and Stewart 1992), and instrumented seals have been recorded to dive continuously for periods up to 16 hours. Dives at dawn and dusk are deeper than at night, and indicate that Crabeater feeding activity is also tied to the daily vertical migrations of Krill. They have a general pattern of feeding from dusk until dawn, and hauling-out in the middle of the day.<br/>Crabeater Seals feed primarily on Antarctic Krill, <em>Euphausia superba</em>, which accounts for over 90% of their diet, with the remainder made up of fish and squid. New information indicates that the diet composition of the Crabeater Seal can display some plasticity, and they can compensate when Krill availability decreases by incorporating more fish (&gt;25% of their diet; Hückstädt <em>et al</em>. 2012). All of the post-canine teeth are ornate, with multiple accessory cusps that interlock to form a network for straining Krill from the seawater. A ridge of bone on each mandible fills the gap in the mouth behind the last upper post-canine teeth and the back of the jaw, which helps prevent the loss of Krill from the mouth when feeding.<br/><br/>Crabeater Seals are frequently encountered alone or in small groups of up to three on the ice or in the water. Much larger groups of up to 1,000 hauled-out together have been observed. They can be seen swimming together in herds estimated to be up to 500 animals, breathing and diving almost synchronously.","There are currently no direct threats from human activity throughout most of the species’ normal range.<br/><br/>A mass die-off of Crabeater Seals was reported from an area near a research base on the Antarctic Peninsula in 1955 (Laws and Taylor 1957). About 3,000 animals were trapped in areas five to 25 km from open water and most died over a two to three month period. None of the animals examined appeared to be starving, and numerous abortions of foetuses were noted. A disease outbreak was suspected, but never identified. Antibodies to canine distemper virus were found in Crabeater Seals from this area in 1989 (Bengtson <em>et al.</em> 1991).<br/><br/>The effects of global climate change on Antarctic seals are unknown. Learmonth <em>et al</em>. (2006) suggest that Crabeater Seal numbers may decline with increasing temperatures if Antarctic sea ice is significantly reduced. Loss of sufficient areas of pack ice habitat used for pupping, resting, avoidance of predators, and access to preferred foraging areas because of changes from warming could lead to population declines. The loss of sea ice has the potential to negatively impact Crabeater Seals given their high level of specialization on Antarctic Krill. Sea ice coverage is of particular importance for the survival of juvenile stages of Krill, and ultimately determines the biomass of adult Krill that is available for higher trophic level predators. It is unclear whether Crabeater Seals might be able to switch from their highly specialized, Krill-based diet, to a more generalist strategy with rapid loss of sea ice. The effects of loss of large amounts of ice on the Antarctic continent, general climate warming, or sea level rise, on Antarctic Ocean circulation and productivity and on Antarctic marine resources such as seals are unknown.<br/><br/>Seasonal tourism in the Antarctic and Sub-Antarctic has increased steadily in the last 30 plus years, and is currently at all-time high levels. The effects of increased vessel noise, disturbance from vessel passage, and close approach by people in small boats and on land on Crabeater Seal behaviour, distribution and foraging are unknown. There is a small risk of injury to animals from collision with boats or crushing from large vessel passage through ice fields.<br/><br/>There are no reports of significant interactions between Crabeater Seals and fisheries. Commercial harvest of Krill may pose a threat to Crabeater Seals, if it ever becomes established at a large scale.","The Crabeater Seal is a widespread species, and, as is the case for other Seals inhabiting the&#160;Antarctic&#160;pack ice, population assessments are very difficult and expensive to conduct and therefore infrequently undertaken. Published global population estimates range from two million (Scheffer 1958) up to 50-75 million animals (Erickson <em>et al</em>. 1971). However, early estimates were based on very limited sampling and were highly speculative. The most recent available data, obtained during the multi-national effort conducted under the umbrella of the Antarctic Pack Ice Seal program in the late 1990s, provided a population size estimate of approximately 8,000,000 animals for the area surveyed (Southwell <em>et al</em>. 2012). Considering that major areas of the pack ice around the continent were not surveyed, there is a large uncertainty regarding the actual population size of the species. Yet, Crabeater Seals are considered to be one of the most abundant seal species (if not the most abundant) and one of the most numerous large mammals on Earth.",Unknown,"The distribution of Crabeater Seals is tied to seasonal fluctuations of the pack ice. They can be found right up to the coast and ice shelves of Antarctica, as far south as the Bay of Whales (Lindsey 1938), during late summer ice break-up. They occur in greatest numbers in the seasonally shifting pack ice surrounding the Antarctic continent. As vagrants they travel as far north as New Zealand and the southern coasts of Africa, Australia and South America. Crabeater Seals have been known to occasionally wander far inland and die in the dry valleys adjacent to McMurdo Sound. A live animal was found 113 km from open water at an elevation of 920 m asl, and carcasses have been found as high as 1,100 m asl (Kooyman 1981, Rice 1998).",Several brief episodes of commercial harvesting of Crabeaters ended when they were determined to be economically unsuccessful.,Terrestrial|Marine,The Crabeater Seal is not listed as endangered or threatened on any National Red List.

45228501,15106,Odobenus rosmarus,Vulnerable,A3c,2016,2016-02-05 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"While Walruses occur over a vast area and are common in some regions, their future is by no means secure. Climatic warming will surely require them to live in a much different environment as sea ice recedes and disappears from many of the areas they have used in past centuries (Kovacs <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2011, 2012, 2015; Laidre <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2008, 2015). All reasonable scenarios expect that such drastic changes to their habitats will cause Walrus populations to decline throughout most of their range. Because of the expectation of a decline the IUCN SSC Pinniped Specialist Group has recommended that the Atlantic Walrus be listed as Near Threatened under criterion C1, and they have recommended that the Pacific Walrus be listed as Data Deficient. Models suggest that Pacific Walrus abundance declined by 50% between 1980 and 2000 (Udevitz <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2009), and there is ongoing concern about female body condition and possible impacts on calf survival (Kovacs <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2015). Considering both the certainty of future decline in their habitat quality and the limitations of abundance and trend data, the Walrus as a species is listed as Vulnerable under criterion A3c.","The Walrus’s most distinctive feature is the external tusks, which are possessed by both males and females. The tusks can grow to be a meter long and can weigh 5 kg in large bulls. They are one of the largest pinnipeds with Pacific Walrus males reaching 3.6 m in length and weighing 880-1,557 kg; adult females are about 3 m and 580-1,039 kg. Atlantic Walrus adults are slightly shorter and lighter. Newborns are 1-1.4 m long and weigh 33-85 kg (Fay 1981, Kovacs and Lydersen 2006).<br/><br/>Walruses are extremely social animals, and when on land or ice they are normally found in tight groups ranging in size from a few individual up to thousands. At sea they usually travel in groups as well (Fay 1981, Kovacs and Lydersen 2006). There is significant sexual segregation outside the breeding season, with males often being found in areas away from females and their calves. Walruses have a narrow ecological niche. They depend on: 1) the availability of large areas of shallow water with suitable bottom substrate to support a productive bivalve community, 2) the presence of reliable open water over rich feeding areas, particularly in winter when access to feeding areas is limited by ice cover, and 3) the presence of haul out areas in reasonably close proximity to feeding areas. The preferred haul out platform is sea ice, although both subspecies routinely use terrestrial haul out sites in the summer and autumn (Fay 1981, Hamilton <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2015).<br/><br/>Because they feed in shallow, coastal areas Walruses usually perform only relatively shallow, short dives (Fay and Burns 1988, Born 2005). The Walrus’s main prey is bivalve mollusks that they search for using their sensitive whiskers on or in soft-bottom substrates. In addition to Clams, their diet can include Worms, Snails, soft shell Crabs, Amphipods, Shrimp, Sea Cucumbers, Tunicates, and even slow-moving Fishes (Born 2005, Sheffield and Grebmeier 2009). Some Walruses prey on birds and other marine mammals, eating a variety of Seal species (Lowry and Fay 1984, Fox <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2010, Seymour <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2014). Walrus make foraging trips that last from a few hours to several days; in the Pacific, trips are shorter in duration and distance when they originate from sea ice versus land (Udevitz <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2009).<br/><br/>Courtship and mating occur in the winter. Walruses are polygynous and the males establish small aquatic territories where they vigorously vocalize and display adjacent to females hauled-out on ice floes (Sjare and Stirling 1996, Sjare <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2003). Most births occur in May of the following year. Most female Walrus give birth at 7-10 years old and usually they only produce one calf every three years. Males become sexually mature between 7-10 years old, but are not physically and socially mature enough to successfully compete for breeding opportunities until they are approximately 15 years old. Longevity is approximately 40 years (Fay 1981).<br/><br/>The primary predators of Walrus are Polar Bears and Killer Whales (Killian and Stirling 1978, Fay 1981).","Human harvests have had a major impact on abundance of Pacific Walrus over the past 200 years (Fay <em>et al.</em> 1997). The Pacific Walrus continues to be an important subsistence resource for indigenous people in coastal Alaska (Robards <em>et al.</em> 2013), and harvests in recent years are likely to have been sustainable (Garlich-Miller <em>et al.</em> 2011, Udevitz <em>et al.</em> 2013). The future, however, is uncertain, and as global warming and concomitant sea ice declines impact the Walrus population harvest levels could have an important influence on future abundance (Jay <em>et al.</em> 2011). A variety of mechanisms are available at the international, national, and local level that could be used to ensure that future harvests remain sustainable (Garlich-Miller <em>et al.</em> 2011, MacCracken 2012). Atlantic Walruses are protected from harvest in Norway (Henriksen and Hilmo 2015) and in Russia (Boltunov <em>et al.</em> 2010). Subsistence harvests are regulated by quotas in Canada and in Greenland and additionally, females are not supposed to be harvested in Greenland (Wiig <em>et al.</em> 2014). Recovery is the management target for all currently harvested Atlantic Walrus stocks so allowable takes are conservative.<br/><br/>Observations of incidental take of Pacific Walrus indicate that direct conflicts with fisheries are uncommon (US Fish and Wildlife Service 2010); however, trawl fisheries could disturb important benthic feeding areas (COSEWIC 2006). Human disturbance at land-based haul-out sites, low-level aircraft over-flights and near-shore passage of vessels can have serious effects on hauled out Walruses, as they are highly susceptible to disturbance and easily panicked into stampedes that can result in high mortality, particularly among calves (Udevitz <em>et al.</em> 2013). Walruses feed low in the trophic web, so generally have relatively low levels of contaminants in their tissues, though individuals that consume marine mammal prey are likely at higher risks (Wolkers <em>et al.</em> 2006, Skoglund <em>et al.</em> 2010). Sedimentation from industrial development can cause degradation of their prey populations and oil pollution can negatively impact the filter-feeding Clams that make up most of their diet.<br/><br/>Global warming and associated reduction in the extent, seasonal persistence, and characteristics of sea ice are likely to negatively affect Walrus (e.g., Huntington 2009; Kovacs <em>et al.</em> 2011, 2012, 2015). The seasonal duration of ice cover is shrinking throughout their range, and at the extreme the Barents Sea region has lost 42 days of ice coverage per decade during 1979-2013 (Laidre <em>et al.</em> 2015). Declining sea ice reduces suitable strata for pupping and breeding aggregations and limits access to offshore feeding areas (Laidre <em>et al.</em> 2008, Kovacs <em>et al.</em> 2011). Global climate models suggest moderate changes in winter-spring ice conditions in the Bering Sea by the mid-2000s (20-30% ice loss) and major changes by the late-2000s (60-90% loss). Summer sea ice in the Chukchi Sea is predicted to show major losses (&gt;80%) by the mid-2000s (Garlich-Miller <em>et al.</em> 2011). In prior years, Walrus in the Chukchi Sea spent the summer hauling out mostly on sea ice and foraging over a wide area on the shallow continental shelf (Fay 1982). In recent years with little or no summer ice cover, animals have begun to haul out on land in large groups and go to sea to forage from there (Robards and Garlich-Miller 2013). Coastal haul-outs are less suitable because of increased energy required to reach prey resources and mortality due to crowding, disturbance events, and predation (Jay <em>et al.</em> 2011, Garlich-Miller <em>et al.</em> 2011, MacCracken 2012). Reduction in sea ice has already lead to increased shipping and development of oil and gas fields in the southern parts of the Walrus’s range, bringing increased risk of spills and discharge of pollutants and disturbance (Semyonova <em>et al.</em> 2015), and oil and gas exploration is moving north rapidly with exploration licenses having already been granted in East Greenland.","The Pinniped Specialists Group assessed the abundance and trend of the two Walrus subspecies as follows:<br/><ul><li>Atlantic Walrus--total abundance likely &gt;25,000, some subpopulations increasing but overall trend unknown</li><li>Pacific Walrus--total abundance likely &gt;200,000, trend unknown</li></ul>Considering these results, the abundance of the Walrus species as a whole is likely &gt;225,000 and the trend is unknown.",Unknown,"Walruses have a discontinuous circumpolar Arctic and sub-Arctic distribution and are mostly found in relatively shallow continental shelf areas (Fay 1981, Rice 1998). The Atlantic Walrus occurs from the eastern Canadian Arctic to the western Kara Sea (Stewart <em>et al</em>. 2014). Within that region nine stocks are generally recognized. Historically, Atlantic walruses occurred south to the Gulf of Saint Lawrence in the northwestern North Atlantic, but they were extirpated in this region by excessive harvesting (McLeod <em>et al</em>. 2014). Vagrants have been reported from New England, Iceland, and from Norway south to the Bay of Biscay in France/Spain. The Pacific Walrus normally ranges from the Bering and Chukchi Seas, which constitute the center of its range, to the Laptev Sea in the west and the Beaufort Sea in the east, with vagrants south into the North Pacific Ocean to Japan and southcentral Alaska (Fay 1982).","Native people of the Arctic have depended on Walrus for food, hides, ivory and bones since first contact, and subsistence harvests continue today in Canada, Greenland, Alaska, and Russia. All Walrus populations were severely depleted by episodic commercial hunting that was heaviest from the 18th through to the mid-20th centuries (Fay 1982). Since the 1970s, the Pacific Walrus has been managed under numerous international and national conservation programs that have eliminated commercial hunting and limited trade (Garlich-Miller <em>et al.</em> 2011). The Pacific Walrus continues to be an important subsistence resource for indigenous people in coastal Alaska (Robards <em>et al.</em> 2013), and harvests in recent years are likely to have been well within sustainable limits (Garlich-Miller <em>et al.</em> 2011, Udevitz <em>et al.</em> 2013). Atlantic Walruses are protected from harvest in Norway and in Russia (Boltunov <em>et al.</em> 2010, Henriksen and Hilmo 2015). Harvests are quota regulated in Canada and in Greenland, and additionally females are not supposed to be harvested in Greenland (Wiig <em>et al.</em> 2014).<br/><br/>Walrus are listed on Appendix III of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora which allows for control of global trade in Walrus ivory.",Terrestrial|Marine,"Atlantic Walruses are protected from harvest in Norway and in Russia; they are on the Norwegian Red List (Henriksen and Hilmo 2015) and they are listed in the Russian Red Book (Boltunov <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2010). Harvests are quota regulated in Canada and in Greenland (Wiig <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2014). The Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada designated the Atlantic Walrus as a species of “special concern”, which acknowledges that they are at risk of becoming threatened in this region; this classification is attributed to climate change impacts on sea ice (COSEWIC 2006).<br/><br/>Within the USA, the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) generally prohibits taking of Walrus unless it is by an Alaska Native for subsistence or production of handicrafts. MMPA regulations are used to control impacts caused by commercial fishing, oil and gas development, and other human activities. The Pacific Walrus is currently under consideration for listing under the US Endangered Species Act which would provide additional protections. Within the US there are currently no legal mechanisms to regulate discharge of greenhouse gas emissions, the primary cause of climate warming and sea ice loss (Garlich-Miller <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2011).<br/><br/>In Russia, Walruses were commercially harvested through the 1980s, but harvests ended in 1991 due to economic collapse of the industry.

45228952,15269,Ommatophoca rossii,Least Concern,,2015,2014-09-30 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The most recent circumpolar estimate of Ross Seal abundance indicates a total population of over 78,000 individuals.<strong> </strong>There is no indication of a declining trend in the population. However, abundance estimates are somewhat dated and have considerable uncertainty around them and therefore, the population trend is unknown.<strong> </strong>Ross Seals depend on sea ice for reproduction and at some time in the future they could be adversely affected by a reduction in sea ice due to continued climate warming. The Ross Seal is a widespread and abundant species that does not qualify for any of the IUCN threatened categories, thus they should be listed as Least Concern<strong>.</strong><br/><em></em>","At maturity, Ross Seals are the smallest of the four Antarctic phocids. Based on a small sample of measured animals, Ross Seal males reach 1.68-2.09 m in length and 129-216 kg and females are slightly larger at 1.96-2.5 m in length and 159-204 kg. It is estimated that pups are about one metre and 16 kg at birth; eight suckling pups examined in November were 109-138 cm in length and 40-75 kg. Age at sexual maturity is thought to be three to four years for females and two to seven years for males (Ray 1981). Adults reach final body size at approximately nine years of age and can live to at least 20 years (Skinner and Klages 1994).<br/><br/>Most pups are born in November, with a peak from early to mid-November (Southwell <em>et al.</em> 2003). Weaning takes place at about one month of age, although little is known of the relationship between mother and pup. Nursing pups have been seen swimming between ice floes so they appear to be aquatic to some degree. Mating is thought to occur in the water, but has not been observed. Although this species has been presumed to be polygynous, genetic studies do not support this hypothesis and indicate a monogamous mating system (Curtis <em>et al.</em> 2011). Moulting is believed to occur in January, at which time many Ross Seals appear to fast (Skinner and Klages 1994), and moulting seals can form large aggregations on ice floes. During summer Ross Seals exhibit a diel haulout pattern with most seals hauled out on the ice at midday (Ray 1981, Bengtson and Stewart 1997, Southwell 2003). Satellite tracking suggests that Ross Seals are pelagic foragers, spending months in the open ocean foraging in association with the Antarctic Polar Front&#160; and returning to the pack-ice to breed in October-November (Blix and Nordøy 2007).<br/><br/>Recent work using electronic devices to monitor at-sea behaviour of Ross Seals has revealed that the species dives continuously throughout the day (average of 108 dives per day), frequently reaching depths of 100–300 m, and displays a clear diel pattern in their diving depth. The deepest dive recorded for the species was 792 m, while the longest dives were over 30 minutes in duration (Blix and Nordøy 2007). The diet of Ross Seals is largely unknown, but the limited available data indicate that they eat mostly squid, with lesser amounts of fish and some invertebrates including krill (Ray 1981, Southwell <em>et al.</em> 2012). Skinner and Klages (1994) identified only Antarctic Silverfish (<em>Pleurogramma antarcticum</em>) in 20 animals examined; no other fish were present. Several species of squid were also recorded in this latter study, but many stomachs were empty when the animals were collected in January, suggesting that this species eats little or fasts entirely during the post-breeding moult period.<br/><br/>Killer Whales and Leopard Seals are presumed to be predators of the Ross Seal.","Ross Seals are typically found hauled out in dense consolidated pack ice and can usually only be reached by icebreakers. Small numbers of animals have been collected for commercial purposes, scientific studies and museums, but otherwise interactions with humans have been few. When wandering outside the pack ice zone, Ross Seals could come in contact with commercial fishing operations, but there are no reports of interactions to date.<br/><br/>Ross Seals have antibodies to phocine herpesvirus confirming some exposure, but in the only available study they did not have antibodies to <em>Trichinella</em>, <em>Toxoplasma</em>, or phocine distemper virus (Tryland <em>et al</em>. 2012).<br/><br/>Our very limited knowledge about the species makes it difficult to make any projections about how global climate change might affect the Ross Seal. However, Learmonth <em>et al</em>. (2006) suggest that Ross Seal numbers may decline with increasing temperatures if Antarctic sea ice is significantly reduced. Siniff <em>et al</em>. (2008) suggest that they will be among the least impacted of the Antarctic seals because they do not feed in sea-ice covered areas. Climate change will affect them when loss&#160;of sufficient areas of consolidated ice habitat used for pupping, resting, and avoidance of predators comes to a critical level. Further, due to their pelagic nature, reductions of sea ice would imply longer travel distances to reach their preferred foraging areas. The effects of loss of large amounts of ice on the Antarctic continent, general climate warming, or sea level rises on Antarctic Ocean circulation and productivity and on Antarctic marine resources such as seals are largely unknown.","Ross Seals typically haul out in dense consolidated pack ice and are spread over large geographic areas. As these areas can usually only be reached by ice-breaking ships or long-range aircraft, it is difficult to estimate population size and trend with high certainty. Published global population estimates range from 20,000-50,000 (Scheffer 1958) up to 220,000 animals (Gilbert and Erickson 1977). However, early estimates were based on very limited sampling and were highly speculative. Analysis of ship and aerial sighting surveys carried out around the Antarctic Continent between 1968 and 1983 provided an estimate for the global population of Ross Seals in the pelagic pack ice of the Southern Ocean in the order of 130,000 animals (Erickson and Hanson 1990). No indication of the uncertainty around that estimate was given. The most ambitious and coordinated effort to determine abundance of this species to date was the Antarctic Pack-Ice Seal (APIS) project which conducted aerial and shipboard surveys around the continent during 1996-2001. This international programme also included deployment of satellite-linked dive recorders to investigate haulout behaviour. APIS surveys resulted in an estimate of 78,500 (95% CL 39,400-231,200) Ross Seals in the surveyed areas (Southwell <em>et al</em>. 2012). Given the uncertainty in the estimates, only gross changes in Ross Seal population size could be confidently detected from repeated surveys (Southwell <em>et al</em>. 2008). New data from genetic studies estimating the effective population size of the species indicate a larger population size for the Ross Seal than that estimated using traditional population size surveys (Curtis <em>et al</em>. 2011), but those methods have not been rigorously tested.",Unknown,"Ross Seals have a circumpolar distribution in Southern Ocean waters surrounding Antarctica. In the summer, they are usually seen in dense consolidated pack ice where they haul out to breed, moult and rest. Satellite tracking suggests that Ross Seals spend several months each year foraging in the open ocean in association with the Antarctic Polar Front (Blix and Nordøy 2007). Vagrants have been reported from many sub-Antarctic islands including the South Sandwich Islands, the South Orknies, and Falkland, Scott, Kerguelen and Heard Islands, as well as from southern Australia (Rice 1998, Thomas 2002).",This species is not used at present.,Terrestrial|Marine,"Ross seals are protected by the Antarctic Treaty and the Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Seals, and are not listed as threatened or endangered on any national Red List.",Antarctic,,false,false,Global
45229114,17013,Phoca vitulina,Least Concern,,2016,2016-01-04 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"Harbor Seals are distributed very widely and their total population size is estimated at about 600,000. Trend in abundance is unknown for four of the subspecies; the Eastern Pacific Harbor Seal is known to be increasing. While in many areas Harbor Seals share the coastal zone with increasing human populations and suffer some impacts as a result, current threats appear to be tolerable and/or manageable. As a species, the Harbor Seal does not meet any IUCN criteria for a threatened listing and is listed as Least Concern. However, the subspecies <em>Phoca vitulina mellonae</em>, the Ungava Seal, is listed separately as Endangered.","Harbor Seals live mostly in the coastal waters of the continental shelf and slope, and are commonly found in bays, rivers, estuaries, and intertidal areas. They also occur in some lakes (Burns 2009). They will haul out on rocks, sand and shingle beaches, sand bars, mud flats, vegetation, sea ice, glacial ice and a variety of man-made structures. They usually lie close to the water to permit a rapid escape from threats. Sex and age segregation is common in most populations (Kovacs <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1990). They are usually extremely wary and shy on land and therefore it is almost impossible to approach them when they are hauled out without stampeding them into the water. However, habituation to human activities in their vicinity can occur. Most haul-out sites are used daily, based on tidal cycles and other environmental variables, although foraging trips can last for several days (Grellier <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1996, Lowry <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2001). Although Harbor Seals are considered a non-migratory species with a high degree of site fidelity to a haul out, long-distance dispersal of juveniles, emigration, and establishment of new haul out sites do occur (Ries <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1999, Bjorge <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2002). There is also evidence of seasonal changes in at-sea distribution and home range size by age class and sex (Lowry <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2001, Dietz <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2013).<br/><br/>Adult male Harbor Seals are 1.6-1.9 m long and weigh 70-150 kg, adult females are 1.5-1.7 m and 60-110 kg. At birth, pups are 82-98 cm and 8-12 kg (Burns 2009). Males become sexually mature when four to six years old. Female Harbor Seals usually become sexually mature when three to five years old (Harkonen and Heide-Jorgensen 1990). Throughout the Harbor Seal's range, the time of birthing varies widely and may follow a latitudinal cline (Temte 1994). Peak pupping date varies from mid March to early September. The mating system is promiscuous, or weakly polygynous, with males defending underwater calling sites (Boness <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2006, Van Parijs and Kovacs 2002). Mating usually takes place in the water, with females coming into oestrus about a month after giving birth. Molt follows the pupping and mating season. The timing of onset of molt depends on the age and sex of the animal with yearlings molting first and adult males last (Reder <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2003). <br/><br/>Females give birth to a single precocial pup. Most pups shed their silvery gray lanugo coat in the uterus before birth and are born with a juvenile pelage. Exceptions to this include pups born prematurely, and some that are born early in the breeding season (Bowen <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1994). Pups usually enter the water soon after birth, and because of tidal inundation at many sites used for birthing, this often occurs within hours (Burns 2009). Pups are suckled for an average of 26 days (Drescher 1979). Unlike Grey Seals, Harbor Seal females need to feed during the lactation period to produce adequate milk for their rapidly growing pup, and as a result they undertake regular feeding trips to sea (Thompson <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1994, Bowen <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2001).<br/><br/>At sea, Harbor Seals are most often seen alone, but they occasionally occur in small groups. Localized aggregations can form in response to feeding opportunities and concentration of prey. Harbor Seals are generalist feeders that take a wide variety of fish, cephalopods, and crustaceans obtained from surface, mid-water, and benthic habitats (e.g., Pitcher 1980, Harkonen 1987, Olesiuk <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1990, Pierce <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1991). Their diet is highly varied, and animals from different populations and areas show differences, and there is also variation associated with seasonal and interannual changes in the abundance of prey (e.g., Tollit <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1997, Thompson <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1996). Generally, a few species dominate the diet at any one location and time of year. They are primarily a coastal species with dive depths generally less than 100 m (Tollit <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1998), but dives to as much as 480 m have been recorded in Alaska (Frost <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2001). <br/><br/>Longevity is about 30-35 years with females living longer than males. Known predators include Killer Whales, Great White and Greenland Sharks, and possibly other Shark species, Steller Sea Lions, Walrus, Eagles, Gulls, and Ravens (Burns 2009).","Historically, there have been organized population reduction programs and bounty schemes for Harbor Seals in some range states, largely because of perceived competition with fisheries. Hunting and/or licensed killing to protect fisheries has largely been eliminated but subsistence hunting by Alaska Natives is allowed in the US. In the eastern Atlantic, Harbor Seal population reduction programs date from the early 1980s and 1990s in Iceland and Scotland, respectively (Bowen and Lidgard 2012) and continue at some level today (e.g., Butler <em>et al.</em> 2008). An extermination program at the beginning of the 20th century dramatically depleted Harbor Seals in the Baltic Sea. Quotas for Harbor Seals are set annually in Norway and a bounty is paid to hunters in several regions of the country.<br/><br/>Mass die-offs from viral outbreaks have killed thousands of Harbor Seals on both sides of the Atlantic, but most notably in Europe caused by phocine distemper virus (Dietz <em>et al.</em> 1989, Harkonen <em>et al.</em> 2006, Reijnders 1986). Because Harbor Seals haul out on nearshore and coastal mainland sites, they are exposed to terrestrial wild carnivores, pets and feral animals, and waste from human populations that create an increased risk of exposure to communicable diseases. <br/><br/>Because many Harbor Seals live and feed in close proximity to large populations of humans they are exposed to, and can accumulate, high levels of industrial and agricultural pollutants (e.g., organochlorines, PCBs, dioxins) that negatively affect reproduction (Reijnders 1986), induce vitamin deficiency (Brouwer <em>et al.</em> 1989), and cause immunosuppression (Ross <em>et al.</em> 1995). Both chronic oil spills and discharges and episodic large-scale spills can cause direct mortality (Frost <em>et al.</em> 1994, 1999; Hoover-Miller <em>et al.</em> 2001) and could have long term impacts on Harbor Seal health and their environment. <br/><br/>Noise and other disturbance from offshore oil and gas, and the development of offshore renewable energy such as wind farms, may also affect the foraging behavior and physical condition of Harbor Seals (Hastie <em>et al.</em> 2015, Skeate <em>et al.</em> 2012).<br/><br/>Harbor Seals live in coastal areas many of which are heavily fished and this results in entanglement and bycatch issues (see Desportes <em>et al.</em> 2010) Overfishing and environmental variability (including global climate change) may also impact Harbor Seal prey populations.","Available data on Harbor Seal abundance were compiled and reviewed in the 2016 Red List assessments for the five recognized subspecies.<br/>Estimates of the number of mature individuals, and population trend, for each of those subspecies were as follows:<br/><ul><li>Eastern Atlantic Harbor Seal--65,000, trend unknown</li><li>Western Atlantic Harbor Seal--60,000, trend unknown</li><li>Eastern Pacific Harbor Seal--170,000, increasing</li><li>Kuril Seal--&lt;10,000, trend unknown</li><li>Ungava Seal--50, trend unknown</li></ul>Combining those estimates, the total number of mature Harbor Seals worldwide is about 315,000. Bjorge <em>et al</em>. (2010) estimated the total worldwide population of Harbor Seals as approximately 610,000-640,000. The overall trend in numbers is unknown.",Unknown,"Harbor Seals are one of the most widespread of the pinnipeds. They are found throughout coastal waters of the northern hemisphere, from temperate to polar regions. Five subspecies are recognized:&#160;the Eastern Atlantic Harbor Seal&#160;occurs in the eastern Atlantic from Brittany to the Barents Sea in northwestern Russia and north to Svalbard, with occasional sightings as far south as northern Portugal,&#160;the Western Atlantic Harbor Seal&#160;occurs in the western Atlantic from the mid-Atlantic United States to the Canadian Arctic and east to Greenland and Iceland,&#160;the Ungava Seal&#160;only lives in a few lakes and rivers in northern Quebec, Canada, that drain into Hudson and James Bays,&#160;the&#160;Eastern Pacific Harbor Seal&#160;is found in the eastern Pacific from central Baja California, Mexico to the end of the Alaskan Peninsula and possibly to the eastern Aleutian Islands, and&#160;the Kuril Seal&#160;ranges from either the end of the Alaskan Peninsula or the eastern Aleutians to the Commander Islands, Kamchatka, and through the Kuril Islands to Hokkaido (Rice 1998).","Harbor Seals were commercially harvested in British Columbia, and commercial and recreational use also occurred in Alaska. All commercial harvesting ceased several decades ago. Harbor Seals were protected in Canada in 1970 by the Fisheries Act. The U.S. Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 provided a broad prohibition on taking of any marine mammal. However, Alaska Natives are allowed to harvest Harbor Seals for subsistence and creation of authentic handicrafts, and Native handicrafts and edible portions may be sold in Native villages and towns. Some subsistence harvesting still occurs in Alaska, as well as in Canada and Greenland.

Average body length reaches 126-129 cm, with a maximum body length of approximately 140 cm (Wilson <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2014). Both sexes become sexually mature at about 6 years of age, with most breeding females (74% in a 1974 sample) aged between 8 and 17 years (Popov 1979, 1982). The pregnancy rate for females older than 9 is reported to be as low as 0.2-0.33 (Watanabe <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1999, Miyazaki 2002), and Krylov (1990) reports a similar low rate of 0.34 for females aged 10-14 years. Härkönen <em><em>et al.</em></em> (2012), acknowledge that the reproductive rate is low in females &gt;20 years old, but suggest that the reproductive rate is &gt;0.5 for females &lt;20 years old taken together as a group. Since females &lt;20 years old make up approximately two-thirds of the population of adult females, they probably drive the overall reproductive rate for the population up to about 0.5. Both Watanabe <em><em>et al.</em></em> (1999) and Härkönen <em><em>et al.</em></em> (2012) attribute the lower reproductive rates of older females to the effect of long term exposure to organochlorine contaminants in the older animals. Accumulation of contaminants with age has been documented in Caspian seals, but most animals appear to be below thresholds associated with reproductive pathologies (Wilson <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2014).<br/><br/>Pups are generally born from mid-January to late February on the ice, with a birth weight of around 5 kg (Popov 1979), and are nursed for 4-5 weeks. In contrast to ringed seals, females do not usually construct lairs (Frost and Lowry 1981), possibly because sufficient amounts of snow overlying the ice are normally lacking. Pupping on the ice without lairs has allowed direct counts of pups to be made in the recent aerial surveys (Härkönen <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2008, Dmitrieva <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2015). Pups do not enter the water until the ice melts in mid to late March.<br/><br/>The first documented observations of small numbers of Seals breeding in other parts of the Caspian were made in 1982, with females reported pupping on small sand islands in the southern part of the Caspian Sea, although it is likely this behaviour was not new (Krylov 1990). Large numbers of mostly nonbreeding Seals spend the winter in the middle and southern Caspian, with one estimate of 15,000 Seals along the Turkmenistan coast (Krylov 1990).<br/><br/>A post-breeding moult occurs from April to early May, during which the Seals first use the ice and then islands, sand bars, and reed beds for hauling out (Badamshin 1970, Krylov 1990). Presently, Komsomolets Bay and the Durnev Islands in Kazakhstan and Malyj Zhemchuzhnyj island in Russian waters represent the most important moulting habitats (Dmitrieva 2013). Aggregations of several tens of thousands of individuals can be found in Komsomoletz Bay during this period, and around ten thousand at Malyj Zhemchuzhnyj.<br/><br/>During late spring, summer, and early autumn, Caspian Seals are distributed throughout the Caspian Sea. They feed throughout the region, exploiting both the shallow basin in the north and the deep middle and southern basins (Krylov 1990). Recent satellite telemetry studies indicate about 60% of animals move to the middle and southern Caspian, with the remainder staying in the north, primarily around the inflow of Volga and Ural rivers (Dmitrieva 2013). The telemetry studies suggest considerable individual variation in summer migratory and foraging behavior, with individuals spending the summer period separated among shallow, intermediate, and deep water locations. This may reflect individual specialization or niche partitioning in relation to habitat or prey types (Dmitrieva <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2015a). <br/><br/>During the post-moult summer period Seals rarely haul out, spending several months at sea feeding. In late autumn the breeding adults gather in the northeast, hauling out on sandy islands and reed beds in increasing numbers until ice begins to form (Krylov 1990). When the surface freezes over, females form aggregations on the ice to give birth to their pups, tending to gather along cracks in the ice giving them ready access to the water, although like Ringed Seals they also construct and maintain holes in the ice for water access (Heptner <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1996, Härkönen <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2008).<br/><br/>Diving capacity for Caspian Seals is comparable to other small phocids, with maximum dive depths exceeding 200 m and dive times exceeding 20 minutes, but most dives are typically shallower than 15 m and shorter than 5 minutes. During the summer foraging areas are not limited by proximity to haul out sites, and animals may spend up to six months at sea. Foraging appears to be primarily benthic (Dmitrieva 2013).<br/><br/>Caspian Seals feed on a variety of fish species. During the summer and autumn, Seals move to and congregate where prey are abundant, particularly Caspian Kilka (<em>Clupeonella </em>sp.), Caspian Silverside (<em>Atherina mochon</em>), and Caspian Gobies (<em>Gobidae</em>) (Krylov 1990), with <em>Clupeonella </em>species historically making up a major proportion of their total annual diet (Kosarev and Yablonskaya 1994). A report on fish found in the stomachs of Seals in the northern Caspian in 1986-1987 (Piletskii and Krylov 1990) suggested that fish eaten in order of frequency were Roach (<em>Rutilus rutilus</em>), Zander (<em>Lucioperca lucioperca</em>), Gobies (<em>Knipowitschia </em>sp., <em>Neogobius kessleri</em> and <em>Benthophilus </em>sp.), and Bream (<em>Blicca bjoerkna </em>and <em>Abramis brama</em>), followed by C. deliculata and other species. A preliminary study from faecal samples collected on the Apsheron Peninsula in June 2001 and March 2002 suggested that Gobies, Silverside, and shrimp were important constituents of the diet of Seals at those times (Eybatov <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2002). New studies of diet in Caspian Seals are required in order to get an accurate picture of current prey in different areas of the Caspian in light of potential changes to the abundance of fish species due to recent ecological changes occurring in the region.","Unsustainable hunting was the main driver of Caspian Seal decline during the 20th century (Härkönen <em>et al.</em> 2012), and human caused mortality continues to be the main ongoing threat to the population. Recently, by-catch of Seals, primarily in illegal Sturgeon fisheries has been identified as a major cause of Seal mortality (Dmitrieva <em>et al.</em> 2013). Based on semi-structured interviews conducted in fishing communities from Dagestan (Russia), Astrakhan region (Russia), and Atyrau region (Kazakhstan), Dmitrieva <em>et al.</em> (2013) documented a minimum by-catch of 1,215 Seals during the 2008-2009 fishing season, 93% of which occurred in illegal Sturgeon fisheries. However, the study sampling reflected less than 10% of the overall poaching activity in the north Caspian, so the actual by-catch is likely to be substantially higher, and to exceed the Potential Biological Removal level (Wade <em>et al.</em> 1998) for the population (Dmitrieva <em>et al.</em> 2013). Moreover, the survey did not cover fisheries in the middle and southern Caspian. Iranian commercial fisheries cause an estimated mortality of 500 Seals annually (Eybatov <em>et al.</em> 2002). Further work is needed to fully quantify Seal by-catch rates throughout the Caspian Sea, and its implications for population demography. Fishermen frequently sell skins and blubber from bycaught Seals.<br/><br/>Natural sources of mortality include predation and disease. The primary non-human predators are Wolves (<em>Canis lupus</em>) and Sea Eagles (<em>Haliaeetus </em>spp.). Krylov (1990) estimated that Wolves killed 17-40% of Caspian Seal pups on “some breeding grounds from 1974 to 1976”, while Eagles took less than 1% of pups. The reverse was found during recent aerial surveys (Harkonen <em>et al.</em> 2008, Dmitrieva <em>et al.</em> 2015b). Few Wolves were observed each year between 2005-2012, but up to 3,100 Eagles. Eagles are likely to primarily scavenge afterbirth and dead pups, but may also be capable of killing unaccompanied unweaned pups.<br/><br/>Mass mortality events occurred in 1997 and 2000-2001, killing several thousand Seals each time, and have since been attributed to canine distemper virus (CDV). Presence of a hitherto unknown strain of CDV was confirmed in one dead Seal in 1997 (Forsyth <em>et al.</em> 1998), and the same strain was confirmed as the primary cause of death in Seals dying in 2000 in Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan (Kennedy <em>et al.</em> 2000, Kuiken <em>et al.</em> 2006). Examination of archived stranding records in Azerbaijan since 1971, show an increased mortality every few years, suggesting the possibility of previous outbreaks of CDV (Wilson <em>et al.</em> 2014). A serology study of archived samples indicated that CDV was present in Caspian Seals in 1993, 1997, and 1998 (Ohashi <em>et al.</em> 2001). There have been no further mass mortalities since 2001, but disease would become a concern should they reoccur.<br/><br/>Degradation of the Caspian Sea ecosystem and overexploitation of primary food resources may also be threats to Caspian Seals (Reijnders <em>et al.</em> 1993, Barannik <em>et al.</em> 2004). An invasive of Comb Jellyfish, <em>Mnemiopsis leidyi</em>, arrived in the Caspian Sea via ship ballast water in the Volga-Don Canal in 1999 (Ivanov <em>et al.</em> 2000). Comb Jellyfish consume zooplankton rapidly, leading indirectly to a reduction in fish stocks and a substantial impact on local fisheries. A 70% reduction in commercial landings of three species of Kilka was recorded within three years of the Comb Jellyfish invasion (Kideys <em>et al.</em> 2005). Kilka are thought to be important prey for Caspian Seals in the central and southern parts of the sea, and the invasion of Comb Jellyfish is considered a threat to the Seals (Ivanov <em>et al.</em> 2000, Eybatov <em>et al.</em> 2002). In addition to impacts from Comb Jellyfish, most commercial fisheries in the Caspian are considered to be severely depleted or extinct due to unsustainable fishing practices and/or loss of fish habitats such as spawning grounds (Strukova and Guchgeldiyev 2010). While Caspian Seals are known to feed to on commercially important fish species, commercial catch rates are not necessarily an indicator of prey availability, and Seals have a varied and adaptable diet which includes non-commercial species such as Gobies. To date is has not been possible to make any quantitative assessment on potential impacts from changes in Caspian food webs and Caspian Seal energetics and demography. Dmitrieva <em>et al.</em> (2015) did not find a significant correlation when testing for association between annual pup production and net primary productivity 2005-2012, but a longer time series of surveys is required to achieve adequate statistical power.<br/><br/>The Caspian Sea has no outlet and receives most of its input from the Volga, Ural, and other rivers. Contamination of the Volga with lead, copper, zinc, and cadmium has increased dramatically since the mid-1980s, but levels in Seals do not appear to be elevated, with the exception of zinc in some diseased animals that may have suffered homeostatic disturbance of trace metal levels (Anan <em>et al.</em> 2002).<br/><br/>Organochlorine levels (principally polycholorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and dichlorodiphenyltricholoethanes (DDTs)) have been assessed for Caspian Seals dying in the 1997-2001 CDV epizootics (Hall <em>et al.</em> 1999; Kajiwara <em>et al.</em> 2002, 2008; Wilson <em>et al.</em> 2014). Most animals were found to have levels below thresholds believed to cause toxic effects in mammals. Overall levels in Caspian Seals were lower than those seen in European Seal species, comparable to Baikal Seals, and higher than those reported for Arctic species (Wilson <em>et al.</em> 2014). Presently there is no evidence that organochlorine burdens in Caspian Seals cause reproductive or immune impairment, or contributed to the 1997-2001 CDV outbreaks at a population level, although some individual Seals may have high burdens (Kuiken <em>et al.</em> 2006, Eybatov <em>et al.</em> 2002,&#160;Härkönen&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2012, Wilson <em>et al.</em> 2014). Organochlorine accumulation was found to be primarily age related, which means animals at the older end of the age distribution may be at risk of crossing toxicity thresholds towards the end of their reproductive lifespan (Wilson <em>et al.</em> 2014). It has been recommended that levels of persistent organic pollutants should be monitored in the future due to the continuing industrial development around the Caspian region and time elapsed since the last survey following the CDV epizootics (Wilson <em>et al.</em> 2014).<br/><br/>Combined juvenile mortality from continued hunting, natural predation, and fisheries by-catch is believed to be unsustainable. Overall mortality before breeding from all sources is likely to be in the region of 50% (Härkönen <em>et al.</em> 2008). Demographic models indicate such a high rate of juvenile mortality would be capable of causing a continuing decline in the Caspian Seal population, with lowered fertility due to organochlorine contamination being a relatively minor factor (Härkönen <em>et al.</em> 2012). Variation in annual pup production determined from aerial surveys makes empirical estimation of current population trends uncertain (Dmitrieva <em>et al.</em> 2015b), and a longer time series is necessary to assess the demographic trajectory directly.<br/><br/>As a landlocked ice-breeding species with no option to migrate to alternative habitats, Caspian Seals may be vulnerable to future climate change (Kovacs <em>et al.</em> 2012). Warming may cause a reduction in the spatial extent, temporal duration, and stability of the winter ice breeding habitat. Premature break-up of the ice sheet before pups are moulted will cause significant mortality among pups of the year. January-March 2007 was one of the mildest winters in the Caspian in recent years, with ice cover suitable for breeding limited to a narrow strip along the coastline of the north-east Caspian. Storms in mid-February may have caused ice-flows with large numbers of pups to be swept out to sea, and pup counts for that year were less than one third the maximum observed for 2005-2012 (Dmitrieva <em>et al.</em> 2015b). It has also been suggested that poor ice conditions may play a role in the epidemiology of CDV outbreaks due to Seal crowding on limited haulout space and poor condition of weaned pups (Kuiken <em>et al.</em> 2006). Long term trends in Caspian Sea ice cover and the implications for population demography remain to be fully assessed.<br/><br/>Through the geological history of the Caspian, there have been several substantial fluctuations of sea level (Dumont 1998), which will have affected the relative amounts of shallow and deep water habitats available to Seals. The population adapted to those past changes, but there is some concern about whether the same will be possible for future sea level changes given added pressures of habitat loss and human impacts.<br/><br/>Further threats to the Seals on shore and on ice now come from increasing disturbance due to offshore and shoreline developments. One of the largest oil fields in the world is currently being developed in the Caspian, with the construction of numerous offshore oil drilling islands, pipelines, shipping access to these, and onshore logistics facilities. A recent study found that breeding Seals are using shipping channels as artificial leads into the ice and are giving birth close to the edge of these channels. A significant proportion of the breeding population and pups may therefore experience disturbance by shipping traffic depending on the ice conditions (Härkönen <em>et al.</em> 2008). More research is required to quantify the likely impacts of this intensive oil development. The coasts of Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan and Iran have also seen increased development for domestic and leisure use in recent years, with many previously undisturbed stretches of coast now being developed.<br/><br/>Disturbance of island and reef haulout sites by illegal fishing activities and opportunistic Seal hunting are another ongoing problem. Recent surveys have found that the Caspian Seal has effectively disappeared from Azerbaijan, with the once important haulout sites of the Apsheron Peninsula and Archipelago abandoned. These sites were used by many thousands of Seals until the 1930s when they were heavily hunted (Krylov 1990). However, between 1997 and 2002 a few hundred Seals were still counted regularly at these sites (e.g., Allchin <em>et al.</em> 1997, Wilson <em>et al.</em> 2014). Few live Seals have been seen in this area since 2004 (Wilson <em>et al.</em> 2014). The overall Caspian Seal population decline since 2002 is unlikely to account for this total disappearance, which is most probably due in part to severe disturbance by illegal fishing and other coastal activities (T. Eybatov, unpublished data). Similar declines in the regularity of Seal occupancy have also been noted recently at other sites, such as South West Island near the Ural Delta and Osushnoy Island (Kazakhstan), Bautino (Kazakhstan), and in Turkmenbashi Bay (Turkmenistan). The number of Seals at Ogurchinsky Island (Turkmenistan) has also declined from several thousand in the 1980s to a few hundred (P. Erokhin, unpublished observations). The only previously recorded haulout site in Iran, at Ashoora Island, is no longer used by Seals (H. Asadi pers. comm.). There is a need to develop an inventory of all haulout sites throughout the Caspian together with archived and current records of Seal occupancy (Wilson and Goodman 2012).","Historically, the population of Caspian Seals was estimated to have exceeded one million (Krylov 1990, Härkönen <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2012). The most recent estimates of abundance are based on aerial surveys of the breeding population on the northern ice field conducted annually in February between 2005 and 2012 (Härkönen <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2008, Dmitrieva <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2015b). During this period estimated annual pup production ranged between 8,200 (95% confidence intervals 7,130-9,342) and 34,000 (95% confidence intervals 31,275-36,814). This would suggest there are currently approximately 68,000 reproductively mature individuals (male and female, based on the greatest observed pup production), with the total population in the region of 104,000 to 168,000 individuals derived from an age structured model (Härkönen <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2008, 2012; Dmitrieva <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2015b). Variation in weather conditions during surveys may account for some of difference in pup counts between years, but additional contributions from biological factors affecting fecundity cannot be excluded at this time (Dmitrieva <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2015b). The variability in annual pup makes the current population trend uncertain, and a longer time series is necessary to directly assess the demographic trajectory (Dmitrieva <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2015b). However, if pup mortality exceeds 50% due to a combination of natural and anthropogenic causes (a realistic scenario), this could be sufficient to result in ongoing declines (Härkönen&#160;<em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2012). <br/><br/>The population decline throughout the 20th century has been reconstructed by a demographic model using hunting statistics. By the 1950s–1960s, the population was estimated from this model to have been reduced to between 400,000-500,000 Seals (Härkönen <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2012), while an estimate based on a harvest of 86,000 pups in 1966, believed to be most pups born that year, also produced an estimate of 500,000 Seals for that year (Krylov 1990). Aerial surveys conducted in 1976 and 1980 suggested an estimate of 450,000 animals (Krylov 1990), although the hind-casting analysis suggests a population of only about 200,000 Seals remaining at that time (Härkönen <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2012). Surveys in 1987 and 1989 resulted in an estimate of approximately 360,000-400,000 (Krylov 1990), but again the hind-casting analysis suggests this might again have been an over-estimate, with perhaps only about 130,000 Seals remaining by the late 1980s. Overall, the hind-casting analysis indicated a population reduction of about 66% during 1867-1964 and a further reduction of 73% during 1965-2005 (Härkönen <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2012). <br/><br/>Härkönen&#160;<em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> (2012) estimated the total population of adult females as 354,210 in 1945 and 21,000 in 2005, later revised to 34,000 by Dmitrieva <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> (2015b) after accounting for survey observation errors. Although pup production has been revised upwards in more recent publications, this would not affect the relative decline, since it would imply correspondingly higher historical population sizes. The IUCN Criterion A calculator was used to project declines over a three generation period 1955-2015, indicating adult female numbers declined 91.5%. However, the scale of decline is dependent on estimated values for parameters such as pup survival and fertility rates, about which there is some uncertainty (Härkönen&#160;<em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2012). Therefore a more conservative position for the purposes of IUCN classification would be to accept a relative decline of at least 70% until more data are available to refine the historical demography.<br/><br/>Generation time from Pacifici <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> (2013) is 18.8 years.",Unknown,"Caspian Seals are confined to the Caspian Sea. They range throughout the sea with seasonal migration between the southern, middle, and northern basins. More than 99.9% of breeding takes place on ice, which covers the shallow northern parts of the Caspian Sea in from late December to early April in typical years (Krylov 1990, Dmitrieva 2013, Dmitrieva <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2015a). Occasional observations have been made of low numbers (a few tens of individuals) breeding on islets off Turkmenistan (Krylov 1990, Dmitrieva 2013).","Caspian Seals have been commercially exploited since the late 18th century. Harvests averaged 119,000-174,000 per year throughout the 19th century, with peaks of 300,000 having been recorded. In the 20th century, harvest levels peaked in the 1930s with an average annual harvest of 164,000 and a maximum single year take of 227,600. The numbers of Seals taken fell during World War II to an average of 60,800 per year, and subsequently ranged between a low of 41,400 and a high of 108,300 for the period 1951-1975 (Krylov 1990, Härkönen <em>et al.</em> 2012). Commercial harvesting was temporarily halted in 1996 after a much-reduced estimated take of 14,000 Seals. Since the start of the 21st century smaller scale commercial and scientific hunting has taken place in Russia, typically with recorded hunts of tens or hundreds of individuals per year, with a maximum of 4,600 (in 2003-2004), reported for the period up to 2010. Official hunting is conducted under a quota system administered by an inter-governmental body, the Caspian Bioresources Commission. Typical annual quotas are for 18,000 Seals, with 8,000 allocated to Russia, and the remainder divided among the other Caspian states. The scientific rationale for the quotas is not clear. Currently only Russia actively pursues official hunting under the quota, but large scale hunting does not appear to be commercially viable at present and recorded takes are far below the official quota levels (Härkönen <em>et al.</em> 2012, Dmitrieva <em>et al.</em> 2013). The level of ‘unofficial’ or illegal hunting is poorly documented, but illegal hunting on ice on the scale of hundreds of Seals is known to take place periodically (Dmitrieva <em>et al.</em> 2013). Seal skins are used for hats and other clothing in Russia, while Seal blubber is used as a medicinal tonic, fishing bait, and cattle feed in Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan. The total economic value and trading networks for Seal products remain to be fully determined, but high quality individual seal skins may sell for up to $100 US dollars at the point of origin, while seal oil can sell for $14.00 per litre in local markets (Dmitrieva <em>et al.</em> 2013).",Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters),"Various prohibitions, quotas, and protective measures have been taken to conserve the Caspian Seal, beginning in 1940 when seal nets were prohibited. The harvest of moulting Seals in the spring was ended in 1946, and in 1952 the Apsheron Archipelago in Azerbaijan was closed to sealing. Female harvesting on the breeding grounds was stopped in 1966 and all take was prohibited on the eastern islands of the northern Caspian in 1967. These last two changes led to a complete change in the commercial harvest, resulting in a switch to newborn and moulted pups. Quotas on harvest of pups, purportedly based on biological data, began in 1970 (Krylov 1990), although in retrospect the quotas were at unsustainable levels. The Russian Federation continues to consider the Caspian Seal to be a ‘harvested’ species, with quotas set through the Caspian Bioresources Commission (Härkönen <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2008, 2012).<br/><br/>A Seal Conservation Action and Management Plan was approved by the nations bordering the Caspian Sea, pursuant to the 2003 Framework Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the Caspian Sea (Caspian Environment Programme 2007), but it had no legally binding actions. The action plan recommended cessation of hunting, measures to reduce by-catch in legal and illegal fisheries, and the strategic creation of protected areas of sea, ice, and shore. However, to date none of the Caspian states have taken steps to implement the action plan. In 2012 the CaspEco Project, a UNDP funded follow up to the Caspian Environment Programme, published a framework report and road map for the establishment of a network of protected areas for Caspian Seals, including suitable locations (Wilson and Goodman 2012), but no further action has yet taken place. A number of small non-governmental organizations within Caspian countries are involved in producing educational materials and promoting awareness of Caspian Seals. In Iran, localised work with fishing communities has been conducted promoting release rather than killing of live animals found entangled in fishing gear, and a stranded seal rehabilitation facility has been established. In 2014 the Caspian States banned all catching of wild Sturgeon and in recent years Kazakhstan has increased maritime patrols to counter Sturgeon poaching which in principle may have potential to also help reduce seal by-catch.",Palearctic,,false,false,Global
45230946,41670,Histriophoca fasciata,Least Concern,,2016,2015-06-09 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"Despite recent progress in population assessment, estimates of total abundance of Ribbon Seals are imprecise and current population trend is not known. But, with modern assessment methods producing an estimate of nearly 400,000 animals it is evident that the population is quite large. Commercial harvesting of Ribbon Seals stopped in 1994 and numbers have likely been growing since then. The only major threat identified is climate change, and effects of that are not likely to occur in the near future. Ribbon Seals are classified as Least Concern.","Ribbon Seals are medium sized phocids, with a striking pattern of light bands on their darker pelage. Pups at birth are about 86 cm long and weigh about 9.5 kg. Males and females are similar in size with adults typically 150-175 cm long, and weighing 70-90 kg (Tikhomirov 1968, Burns 1981, Fedoseev 2000).<br/><br/>Female Ribbon Seals mature when they are 2-4 years old and males when they are 3-5 years. Adult females give birth to a single white-coated pup in March-May that is nursed for 3-4 weeks. Clean, white, broken pack ice is preferred as a birth site over solid ice sheets and ice with sediment or algae. Breeding occurs after the pup is weaned, and gestation lasts about 9 months after 2-2.5 months of delayed implantation. Ribbon Seals generally live to about 20 years old, but maximum longevity may be as much as 30 years (Burns 1981, Boveng <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2013).<br/><br/>From late winter until summer, Ribbon Seals occupy the pack ice that overlies the continental shelf. They prefer areas of 60-80% ice coverage, rarely use shore fast ice, and do not haul-out on land unless moribund (Kelly 1988, Burns 1981). They typically lie away from the edge of floes and show little concern for the approach of people or vessels. Broken pack ice is preferred over solid ice sheets and highly concentrated pack ice. Their whereabouts when pack ice breaks up or disappears from the Bering Sea and the Sea of Okhotsk is not well known. Kelly (1988) suggested that animals from the Bering Sea population summer in the Chukchi Sea and those from the Sea of Okhotsk, where Ribbon Seals are not seen after mid-July, might move into the southern Bering Sea. Burns (1981) reported that few Ribbon Seals are seen on ice or harvested by Alaska Natives in the Bering Strait and Chukchi Sea after mid-June, and suggested that many Ribbon Seals are probably pelagic during summer and fall, not hauling out on land or ice until the next winter.<br/><br/>Satellite-linked tags were applied to more than 80 Ribbon Seals captured in spring 2005-2010 in the ice of the central and western Bering Sea (Boveng <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2013). All tagged Seals were pelagic during summer and fall. They ranged widely through the Aleutian Islands, Bering Sea, Bering Strait, Chukchi Sea, and adjacent Arctic Basin. Ribbon Seals from the Okhotsk Sea have not been tagged and tracked.<br/><br/>The overall diet of Ribbon Seals is unknown because essentially all the samples that have been examined came from the spring period when the primary activities are pupping, breeding, and molting, and most stomachs are empty. Prey items identified from spring samples included at least 25 species of fishes and 23 species of invertebrates. Commonly occurring prey included Walleye Pollock, Arctic Cod, Pacific Cod, Saffron Cod, Capelin, Smooth Lumpsucker, Eelpout, flatfish, Squids, Octopus, and crustaceans. Crustaceans (Euphausiids and Shrimps) appear to be a main food item for newly weaned and young Seals (Boveng <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2013). Using both stomach contents and stable isotope analysis, Dehn <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> (2007) concluded that trophic level of the Ribbon Seal diet increased with age of the Seal, suggesting a diet transition from mostly crustaceans in young animals to fish and nektobenthos in older animals. The only two stomach samples collected in mid-winter contained Walleye Pollock and Arctic Cod (Burns 1981).<br/><br/>Dive data provided by satellite-linked tags showed relatively shallow diving (mostly to &lt;100 m) during spring when Seals are over the continental shelf, with deeper diving occasionally to &gt;600 m at other times when the Seals may be over deep basins (Boveng <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2013).","Ribbon Seals are sometimes incidentally caught in commercial fisheries, but bycatch data are incomplete. Available data suggest a take of approximately one per year by the Alaska fisheries that were monitored during 1990-2007 (Boveng <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2013). Woodley and Lavigne (1991) reported catches of a few up to 14 per year in fisheries around Japan. During seven years (1993-1999) of monitoring the offshore salmon gill net fishery in Russian Far East, incidental mortality of Ribbon Seals was estimated to be 1,079 individuals (154 per year), mostly juveniles (Burkanov and Nikulin 2001). These data certainly underestimate the total take as bycatch is not monitored in a number of Russian and Alaskan fisheries.<br/><br/>Commercial fisheries target a number of known Ribbon Seal prey species (e.g., Walleye Pollock, Pacific Cod, Pacific Herring, and Capelin), and it is possible that reductions in prey biomass caused by fishing could have an impact on Seal nutrition. At the current time, biomasses of these fishes are fairly high and stable, at least in the Bering Sea, and impacts of removals on Ribbon Seal nutrition are not likely. This situation could change, however, as fishing patterns shift with warming waters and reduced sea ice (Boveng <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2013).<br/><br/>As is true for all ice-associated pinnipeds, climate warming and reductions in seasonal sea ice are likely to have impacts on Ribbon Seals. A detailed review of this issue by Boveng <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> (2013) analyzed the possible individual and cumulative effects on Ribbon Seals of future warmer temperatures, reduced ice, ocean acidification, and associated changes in prey, predators, parasites, and diseases. They concluded that while impacts are likely at some point in the future, they are very difficult to predict or quantify.","Three separate populations of Ribbon Seals have been proposed associated with aggregations of breeding animals - the Bering Sea, the southern Sea of Okhotsk, and the northern Sea of Okhotsk (Fedoseev 2002). However, Boveng <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> (2013) considered the biological evidence for separate breeding populations in the Okhotsk and Bering seas to be weak or equivocal, and they assessed the status of Ribbon Seals as a species with a single population.<br/><br/>Ribbon Seals are difficult to enumerate, as they are widely dispersed over large areas that are generally far from land. Nonetheless, a number of population estimates have been proposed based on counts made during aerial surveys flown over sea ice in the Bering and Okhotsk seas (see Boveng <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2013). In most cases surveys were not designed specifically for Ribbon Seals, and the methods used varied and were often not well described. Burns (1981) reported a population estimate of 90,000-100,000 animals in the Bering Sea, and 140,000 animals in the Okhotsk Sea. Fedoseev (2002) gave an estimate of 120,000 to 140,000 animals for the Bering Sea in 1987 and estimates of between 200,000 (1968-1974) and 630,000 (1988-1990) for the Okhotsk Sea. The Okhotsk Sea population was reported to have averaged 370,000 animals with 320,000 in the central northwestern region and 50,000 in the southern region, in the period between 1968 and 1990 (Fedoseev 2002). Little information was collected on Ribbon Seal abundance between 1991 and 2007. Boveng <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> (2008) used eastern and central Bering Sea survey results from 2007, combined with information on distribution (Fedoseev 1973, Fedoseev <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 1988), to estimate the range-wide abundance of Ribbon Seals as 267,000. The 95% credible interval for that estimate was 154,000-827,000.<br/><br/>American and Russian scientists conducted image-based aerial surveys of ice-associated Seals in the Bering and Okhotsk seas in 2012 and 2013. Data from those surveys are not yet fully analyzed, but using a limited subsample of the data collected from the U.S. portion of the Bering Sea in 2012, Conn <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> (2014) estimated about 184,000 (95% CI: 145,752-230,134) Ribbon Seals in that area. The estimate from the 2013 survey in the Okhotsk Sea was 181,179 (95% CI: 118,392–316,995) Ribbon Seals (Chernook <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2014). The mean estimate from the two surveys combined is about 365,000 animals.<br/><br/>Population trend is unknown.",Unknown,"Ribbon Seals inhabit the northern North Pacific Ocean and adjoining seas, and are seen most commonly in the Bering and Okhotsk seas hauled out on sea ice in the ice front region. They are seen on ice until it has melted in May-June, and seldom haul out on ice or land until the following spring (Burns 1981). The presumption that they live a pelagic lifestyle during summer and fall has been corroborated by tracking with satellite-linked tags (Boveng <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2013). Results from tagging and occasional sightings indicate that during the ice free months they range from Hokkaido and the northern Sea of Japan, eastward through the northern North Pacific and Aleutian Islands to the western Gulf of Alaska, and northward through the Chukchi Sea to the East Siberian Sea, the western Beaufort Sea, and the Arctic Ocean (Moore and Barrowclough 1984, Mizuno <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2002, Boveng <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2013). Single Ribbon Seals occasionally occur along the coast of North America and Asia outside of their normal range (Boveng <em><em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em></em> 2013), and a debilitated vagrant was found on the beach in Morro Bay, California, and taken into captivity (Roest 1964).","Russian commercial hunting of Ribbon Seals began in the Okhotsk Sea in the 1930s and expanded to an annual harvest of 20,000 in the 1950s (Heptner 1996). The annual harvest averaged 11,000 from the 1950s to 1969 and 5,000-6,000 from 1969-1992 (Fedoseev 2002). Commercial hunting began in the Bering Sea in 1961 with an average annual harvest of 9,000 through 1968, declining to 3,000 to 4,000 per year from 1969 to 1992 (Heptner 1996). Reported harvests did not include the number of animals that were killed but lost which may have amounted to 15-20% (Fedoseev 2000). Commercial hunting from sealing vessels stopped in the Bering Sea in 1991 and in the Okhotsk Sea in 1994 because of economic factors, but substantial quotas were still allocated at least through 2005 (Boveng <em>et al.</em> 2013).<br/><br/>Ribbon Seal abundance appears to have declined due to the intensive commercial hunting in the late 1950s and 1960s, but began to rebound after quotas were reduced in 1969 (Burns 1981, Boveng <em>et al.</em> 2013).<br/>The number of Ribbon Seals taken by indigenous hunters for subsistence is not well quantified, but harvests are low and almost certainly sustainable (Boveng <em>et al.</em> 2013).",Marine,"Russia stopped large scale commercial harvesting of Ribbon Seals in 1994. Shore-based harvests for subsistence purposes are at very low levels and not likely to be a threat to the population. In the US, Ribbon Seals are protected under the Marine Mammal Protection Act. In 2007, the US National Marine Fisheries Service was petitioned to list the Ribbon Seal as threatened or endangered under the US Endangered Species Act. In 2013 the agency concluded that such a listing was not appropriate at that time (NMFS 2013).",Nearctic|Palearctic,,false,false,Global
45231341,41672,Pusa hispida,Least Concern,,2016,2016-01-16 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"As a species, Ringed Seals are widely distributed in ice-covered waters of the northern hemisphere, and they may presently number about three million animals. Some of the subspecies, however, have restricted distributions and exist in much smaller numbers. With climatic warming, all subspecies will be negatively impacted by continuing decreases of ice habitats critical for their reproduction. Nevertheless, at this time Ringed Seals as a species do not meet any IUCN criteria for a threatened listing, and are listed as Least Concern. Subspecies <em>Pusa hispida ladogensis</em>, the Ladoga Seal, is assessed separately as Vulnerable and subspecies <em>P. h. saimensis</em>, the Saimaa Seal, is assessed as Endangered.","Ringed Seals are in many respects the “classic” ice-seal. Throughout most of their range they use sea ice exclusively as their breeding, molting, and resting (haul-out) habitat, rarely if ever moving onto land (Frost and Lowry 1981, Reeves 1998). Their ability to create and maintain breathing holes in ice using the well-developed claws on their fore-flippers allows them to thrive in areas where even other ice-associated seals cannot reside. Although Ringed Seals are quite small they deal with the thermal challenges posed by the arctic winter by having a very thick blubber layer, and by building lairs (small caves) in the snow on top of sea ice during the winter. The lairs are particularly important for neonatal survival (Lydersen and Smith 1989). Ringed Seals also use natural cracks along pressure ridges and leads in the sea ice for surfacing and breathing. In Lakes Ladoga and Saimaa, the Baltic Sea, the White Sea, and the Sea of Okhotsk, Ringed Seals haul out and pup on ice but rest on shore during the ice-free period (Sipilä and Hyvärinen 1998, Kelly <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2010).<br/><br/>Reported mean age at sexual maturity for female Ringed Seals varies in the literature from 3.5 to 7.1 years (Holst and Stirling 2002, Krafft <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2006). Males likely do not participate in breeding before they are 8-10 years old. Body sizes vary considerably between regions (Frost and Lowry 1981, Sipilä and Hyvärinen 1998). Ringed seals are long lived, with ages close to 50 reported (Lydersen and Gjertz 1987). Regional productivity rates are variable; reproductive success depends on many factors including prey availability, the relative stability of the ice, and sufficient snow accumulation prior to the commencement of breeding (Lukin 1980, Smith 1987, Lydersen 1995). <br/><br/>A single pup is born in late February-early March for the Ladoga, Saimaa, and Baltic subspecies (Sipilä and Hyvärinen 1998) and March-May for the others (Frost and Lowry 1981). Most births occur in subnivean lairs excavated in snow that accumulates near ice ridges or shorelines. Lairs provide thermal protection against cold air temperatures and high wind chill and afford at least some protection from predators (Smith 1976, Smith and Stirling 1975, Gjertz and Lydersen 1986). For Arctic Ringed Seals, lactation lasts an average of 39 days and pups are weaned at approximately 20 kg (Lydersen and Kovacs 1999). Females become receptive for mating towards the end of the lactation period, similar to other phocid seals. <br/><br/>Ringed Seals molt from mid-May to mid-July and during that period they spend quite a bit of time hauled out (Reeves 1998). Feeding intensity is at a minimum during molting (Ryg <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1990). <br/><br/>Although they may dive to more than 500 m (Born <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2004), in many areas where they feed the water is not that deep and dives are correspondingly shallower (Gjertz <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2000).<br/><br/>Outside the breeding and molting seasons, Ringed Seal distribution is correlated with food availability (e.g., Simpkins <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2003, Freitas <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2008). Numerous studies of their diet have been conducted, and although there is considerable regional variation several patterns emerge. Most Ringed Seal prey are small, and preferred prey tend to be schooling species that form dense aggregations. Fishes are usually in the 5-10 cm length range and crustacean prey in the 2-6 cm range. Typically, a variety of 10-15 prey species are found, with no more than 2-4 dominant prey species for any given area. Fishes are generally more commonly eaten than invertebrates, but diet is determined to some extent by availability of various types of prey during particular seasons as well as by preference, which in part is influenced by energy content of various available prey (Reeves 1998, Wathne <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2000). Commonly eaten prey include Polar Cod, Arctic Cod, Saffron Cod, Redfish, Herring, and Capelin in marine waters (Lowry <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1980, Holst <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2001, Labansen <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2007), and Smelt, Vendance, Perch, Roach, Stickleback, and Burbot in lakes (Sipilä and Hyvärinen 1998). Invertebrate prey species seem to become more important in the open-water season and often dominate the diet of young animals (Lowry <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1980, Holst <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2001). Large Amphipods, Krill, Mysids, Shrimps, and Cephalopods are all eaten by Ringed Seals and can be very important in some regions at least seasonally (Agafonova <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2007).<br/><br/>Polar Bears are the most important predator of Arctic Ringed Seals in most parts of their range and they are also eaten by Killer Whales and Walruses. Wolves, Wolverines, Foxes, Gulls, and Ravens may also prey on Ringed Seals, especially pups, in other areas (Reeves 1998).","Ringed Seals carry loads of organochlorine and heavy metal contaminants from industry and agriculture that have been implicated in uterine pathology in Baltic Seals (Bergman and Olsson 1986), and high concentrations of mercury in Saimaa Seals is thought to have reduced pup production in the 1960s and 1970s (Sipilä and Hyvärinen 1998, Kostamo <em>et al</em>. 2002). However, following restrictions on the use and release of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) into the environment, contaminant levels are dropping rapidly in the Baltic (Kostamo <em>et al</em>. 2002). The same is true with regards to POPs in Arctic populations (Wolkers <em>et al</em>. 2008). Oil contamination poses poorly known risks to Ringed Seals. The greatest impacts would likely result if spills occurred during the pupping season or if food resources were negatively affected (Smith 1987, Reeves 1998).<br/><br/>Manipulation of water levels, recreational snow machine operation, net-fishing, boating, tourism, and development of cottages on the shoreline have been noted as threats to the Ringed Seals in Lake Saimaa, and industrial pollution, net fishing and poaching, as well as disturbance of on-shore summer haulout groups have been highlighted as threats for the Ladoga Seals (Sipilä and Hyvärinen 1998, Agafonova <em>et al</em>. 2007). Predation by Red Fox, Wolves, feral and domestic Dogs, and even birds of prey, are also risks for these lake Seals (e.g., Kunnasranta <em>et al</em>. 2001). By-catch in fisheries and other negative impacts associated with fisheries conflicts seem at present to be the major threat to Saimaa and Ladoga Seals (Kokko <em>et al</em>. 1998, Sipilä and Hyvärinen 1998, Verevkin 2002, Sipilä 2003, Agafonova <em>et al</em>. 2007).<br/><br/>Global warming may pose the greatest threat to Ringed Seals of all subspecies if it leads to large losses of the stable ice habitat required for pupping and rearing their young (Tynan and DeMaster 1997, Learmonth <em>et al</em>. 2006, Kovacs and Lydersen 2008, Laidre <em>et al</em>. 2008). Early break-up of the ice results in poor condition of pups and higher mortality rates (Smith and Harwood 2001). Associated changes in precipitation and weather patterns could also negatively affect Ringed Seal populations if there is insufficient snow cover to protect pups in lairs in the spring (Stirling and Derocher 1993, Ferguson&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2005, Kelly&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2010, Hezel&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2012, Iacozza and Ferguson 2014). Pups born outside lairs have a very low chance of survival; the pups are so small that even large Gulls can be predators if they are exposed (Lydersen and Smith 1989). Declining trends in reproduction and survival of pups have already been noted in some regions that have been attributed to earlier break-up of the sea ice over recent decades and concomitant changes in the marine ecosystem (Ferguson <em>et al</em>. 2005, Stirling 2005). Reductions in arctic sea ice could have quite dramatic effects via prey availability if Polar and Arctic Cod populations are negatively impacted.<br/><br/>  Reductions in sea ice cover will likely lead to increased human activity in arctic regions in the form of shipping and resource extraction industries, with associated increased threat of marine accidents and pollution discharge (Pagnan 2000). An increase in human-created noise in the arctic environment could cause marine mammals, including Ringed Seals, to abandon areas (Tynan and DeMaster 1997) although studies to date suggest relatively minor impacts of development (Davis&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;1991; Moulton&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2002, 2003, 2005; Blackwell&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;2004). However, over-flights by aircraft certainly cause disturbance to Ringed Seals if flights occur by helicopter at less than 1,500 m distance or by fixed-winged aircraft at closer than 500 m (Born&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;1999).","Available data on Ringed Seal abundance were compiled and reviewed in the 2016 IUCN Red List assessments for the five recognized subspecies. Estimates of the number of mature individuals, and population trend, for each of those subspecies were as follows:<br/><ul><li>&#160;Arctic Ringed Seal--1,450,000, trend unknown</li><li>&#160;Okhotsk Ringed Seal--44,000, trend unknown</li><li>&#160;Baltic Ringed Seal--11,500, trend increasing</li><li>&#160;Ladoga Seal--3,000-4,500, trend increasing</li><li>&#160;Saimaa Seal--135-190, trend increasing<br/></li></ul>The world-wide population size of Ringed Seals is not accurately known. Some recent survey data are available from parts of their range (see subspecies assessments), but for the Arctic and Okhotsk subspecies data are limited in spatial scope. Citing many factors such as the vast geographic area occupied by the species, its highly variable distribution within areas that have been surveyed, the unknown relationship between the numbers of individuals observed versus those not seen, and other factors, Frost and Lowry (1981) stated that it is “unwise to attempt an estimate of the world population of this subspecies”. Despite numerous surveys at specific locales conducted since then, Reeves (1998) believed that “this conclusion remains appropriate.”<br/><br/>Nevertheless, the figures presented above indicate the number of mature individuals is more than 1.5 million, and the total population size is likely more than 3 million.",Unknown,"Ringed Seals have a circumpolar distribution throughout the Arctic Basin including records of individuals near the North Pole (Rice 1998). Ringed Seals also range widely into adjacent seas being found in the Bering Sea, Chukchi Sea, Beaufort Sea, Canadian Arctic Archipelago, Hudson Bay, Hudson Strait, Davis Strait, and Greenland, Barents, White, Kara, Laptev, and East Siberian Seas, and they occasionally range into some lake and river systems in Northern Canada (Heide-Jørgensen and Lydersen 1998). Separate subspecies occur in the Baltic Sea, Lake Ladoga in the Russian Federation, Lake Saimaa in Finland, and the Sea of Okhotsk (Frost and Lowry 1981, Reeves 1998). Extralimital records for Ringed Seals extend far south on both sides of the Atlantic, to New Jersey USA in the west and Portugal in the east. In the Pacific, vagrants have been recorded south to the Zhejiang in China and southern California&#160;USA (Rice 1998).","Humans have hunted Ringed Seals in the Arctic since the arrival of people to the region millennia ago (e.g., Murdoch 1893, Riewe and Amsden 1979). They are a fundamental subsistence food item for most coastal dwelling northern indigenous peoples. Reeves <em><em>et al.</em></em> (1998) reported a combined estimate of 10,000 taken per year from the Bering, Chukchi, and western Beaufort Seas by Russians and Alaska Natives. They also estimated that the annual removal of Ringed Seals in the Canadian Arctic was in the “high tens of thousands”, and that in the 1980s, including animals killed and lost, the harvest was between 60,000 and 80,000, and may have exceeded 100,000 in some years. Another substantial annual harvest occurs in Greenland with nearly 100,000 taken per year in the 1970s and approximately 70,000 taken annually in the early1990s (Teilmann and Kapel 1998).<br/><br/>Commercial harvests of Ringed Seals in the early to mid-20th century were sometimes large and probably had significant local impacts on the respective populations. Harvest statistics reported for western Russia by Belikov and Boltunov (1998) suggest that maximum catches earlier in the 20th century exceeded the total allowable catches (TACs) significantly, with harvests of up to 8,900 in the White Sea (1912), 13,200 in the Russian Barents Sea (1962), and 13,200 in the Kara Sea (1933). Those harvests are thought to have dropped considerably in recent decades, though there are no available data. Reporting of harvest statistics and enforcement of TACs is difficult to manage in outlying areas, and the harvest of Ringed Seals in eastern Russia is largely unknown.<br/><br/>Although Ringed Seals in the Baltic and Lakes Ladoga and Saimaa were hunted in the past, hunting is no longer allowed (Sipilä and Hyvärinen 1998, Härkönen <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1998).",Terrestrial|Freshwater (=Inland waters)|Marine,"Ringed Seals are protected by a variety of laws and quotas in different parts of their range, but even within Europe the legal provisions are not always being fully implemented in domestic law (Wilson <em>et al</em>. 2001). The population in Lake Saimaa has been protected since 1955, and additional protection has been afforded via the establishment of two national parks within the lake, and regulation of shoreline development. Similarly, the hunting of Seals in Lake Ladoga was prohibited in 1980 (Sipilä and Hyvärinen 1998). In the USA, the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 allows Ringed Seals to be harvested only by Alaskan Native hunters for subsistence purposes, and that Act generally prohibits all other forms of taking except where specifically permitted. In 2012, the Arctic, Okhotsk, and Baltic subspecies were listed as threatened, and the Ladoga subspecies was listed as endangered, under the US Endangered Species Act; the Saimaa subspecies was listed as endangered in 1993. <a name=""_GoBack""></a>State Nature Reserves at Franz Josef Land and in the White and Kara seas protect large areas of Ringed Seal habitat in the western Russian Arctic, and quotas and licensing of hunting have been in place in various parts of the Russian Federation for decades (Belikov and Boltunov 1998). Baltic Ringed Seals were protected from all killing by the Soviet Union in 1980, by Sweden in 1986, and by Finland in 1988 (Härkönen <em>et al</em>. 1998).",Nearctic|Palearctic,,false,false,Global

It is inferred that populations have declined by 80% over the past 21 years (three generations, generation length estimated at seven years, i.e. 1998-2019) based on overexploitation from hunting and poaching (A2d). Being precautionary, the species is listed as Critically Endangered (A3d+4d), both looking forward three generations (2019-2040) and looking backward one generations and forward two generations (2012-2033). This is based on very high levels of harvest for commercial trafficking of live and dead individuals, industrially processed frozen pangolins, and scales, seemingly across the species’ range, combined with ongoing exploitation for local use. Quantifying the extent of exploitation spatially is difficult but it seems likely that Singapore and smaller islands (e.g., those surrounding mainland and island Southeast Asia in the species’ range) may be the only localities where overexploitation is not a threat. This predicament is compounded by a number of factors including the likelihood that governance and law enforcement changes on a level needed to prevent the overexploitation of the species are unlikely to occur within three generations time. Additionally, there is currently weak evidence that demand reduction efforts in key consumer countries for Asian pangolin products and derivatives, which theoretically could lead to a reduction in harvest, are effective. Meanwhile, the incentives for harvesting and illegally trading in the species are universally high based on the high financial value of pangolin parts and derivatives.</p>","<p>This species is found in primary and secondary forest, including lowland dipterocarp forest, and cultivated areas – including oil palm and rubber plantations – including and near human settlements (e.g., in gardens; Nowak 1999, Azhar et al. 2013, Chong <em>et al.</em> 2016, Nash <em>et al.</em> 2019). Hunters interviewed in Viet Nam reported that the species is found in a variety of habitats, though areas with primary forest support higher abundances, likely because they contain more older, larger trees with hollows suitable for sleeping and for use as den sites (Newton <em>et al</em>. 2008, see also Lim and Ng 2008) and support lower levels of human activity. While there have been no targeted field studies on abundance and population densities in Singapore, the Sunda Pangolin has persisted for decades without an obvious decline in parts of the city where forest quality is not high (Nash et al. 2019). This is likely due to the lack of strong habitat and diet preferences (Lim 2007) and low levels of hunting/poaching. However, further research is required into habitat utilization and the ability of this species to persist outside primary forest in the long-term. A recent study reported that the Sunda Pangolin was found to be able to utilise boulder cavities as dens in areas of high disturbance in Kelantan, Malaysia (Chong <em>et al.</em> 2016). Similarly, a study in Malaysian Borneo recorded Sunda Pangolins more frequently in modified habitat than primary forest, but it is unclear if this is the result of easier detection rather than being the species being more abundant in this habitat and this requires further research (Davies and Payne 1982).</p>  <p>As with most other species of pangolin, the Sunda Pangolin is primarily nocturnal, solitary – except when breeding – and is a specialized feeder on ants and termites. The species is thought to play a role in regulating insect populations. Lim and Ng (2008) observed that Sunda Pangolins foraged for ant species for 67% of the time versus 33% for termite species. The species also consumes ant larvae, bee pupas, flies, worms, crickets, and other insect larvae, as well as sand and grass (Hua <em>et al.</em> 2015). Sunda Pangolins have an observed preference for Oecophylla ant species (weaver ants), both in the wild and in captivity (Lim, 2007; Nguyen <em>et al.</em> 2014), and for <em>Anoplolepis gracilipes</em> (the Yellow Crazy Ant; Lim 2007). Sunda Pangolins will also eat <em>Crematogaster</em> spp. in captivity (Nguyen <em style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 16px; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-decoration: none; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; white-space: normal; word-spacing: 0px;"">et al</em>. 2014), though this species was avoided in the wild in Singapore (Lim 2007).</p>  <p>Sunda Pangolins breed all year round (Lim and Ng 2008, Nguyen <em>et al.</em> 2014, Zhang <em>et al.</em> 2015), although breeding may be seasonal in the northern parts of the species’ range, due to colder temperatures reducing prey activity during the winter months. The species has low fecundity, giving birth to one young after a gestation period of about 6 months (180 days; Nguyen <em>et al. </em>2014, Zhang<em> et al.</em> 2015). Lim and Ng (2008) recorded the activity budget of a radio-tracked female with young and concluded that maternal care following the birth of a single offspring was for approximately three to four months. Challender <em>et al.</em> (2012) witnessed behaviour in captivity concurring with this. Lim and Ng (2008) reported that three natal dens were used, all associated with hollows in large trees (&gt;50 cm diameter at breast height [DBH]); female home-range size was estimated as being 6.97 ha, and daily activity was 127 ± 13.1 minutes (mean&#160;± SE.E), with peak activity between 03h00 and 06h00. Adult male home range based on radio-tracking four individuals was 41.3 ha, daily activity was 165 ± 14 minutes, and 11 genera of ants (67% of diet) were foraged upon (Lim 2007). Lim (2007) observed males displaying territorial behaviour suggesting the species is territorial.</p>  <p>There is little information on mortality rates but it is thought to be high due to indiscriminate poaching, meaning individuals are poached regardless of their age or sex. Further information is needed on survival rates of Sunda Pangolins that are released back into the wild and the impact of releases on resident populations. A number of parasites and diseases have been associated with Sunda Pangolins, some of which can be picked up by trafficked individuals during transportation – pangolin are often kept in poor, unsanitary conditions – therefore there is a risk of transmission between the recently released pangolin and the wild population.</p>  <p>Hunters in Viet Nam consistently reported that the Sunda Pangolin is more arboreal than the Chinese Pangolin (<em>Manis pentadactyla</em>). They are adept climbers and their prehensile tails make excellent climbing aids. They often climb to access ants nests, including weaver ants, in trees (Lim 2007). They sleep in hollows either in, or at the base of, trees, but have also been known to dig burrows in soil and shelter in fallen logs. Females may be dependent on tree hollows around parturition and whilst caring for infants (Lim and Ng 2008). By excavating burrows, as well as ant nests and termite mounds whilst searching for prey, Sunda Pangolins are thought to aerate the soil, facilitating the nutrient cycle, and play an important role in the ecosystem.</p>  <p>The species is also a capable swimmer, like other pangolin species, and appears well adapted to wetland ecosystems e.g., the U Minh wetlands in Viet Nam (Willcox<em> et al. </em>2017). The Sunda Pangolin has also been observed frequenting pools of water when cared for in captivity (Nguyen <em>et al.</em> 2014).</p>","<p>The primary threat to the Sunda Pangolin is overexploitation from hunting and poaching, both targeted and untargeted, for local and international use. The latter is largely driven by demand in China and Viet Nam and associated incentives to supply those markets, and involves industrial quantities of live and dead animals and their meat and scales each year (Wu and Ma 2007, Challender and Waterman 2017, Heinrich <em>et al</em>. 2017). In China and Viet Nam, pangolin meat is consumed as a luxury product in high end urban restaurants (as well as more locally e.g., on the fringes of protected areas in Viet Nam), and the scales are used as an ingredient in traditional medicines to purportedly cure skin ailments, improve blood circulation and stimulate milk secretion in lactating women, as well as to treat other illnesses, including cancer (Yu and Hong 2018). Contemporary trade routes are sophisticated and extensive occurring over land and by sea (Sopyan 2009). Heinrich <em>et al.</em> (2017) studied the global pangolin trade and found a mean of 29 new routes each year between 2010 and 2015. Trafficking today follows a heavy international trade historically. According to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), trade data between 1975 and 2018, trade in this species included ~500,000 animals, which mainly comprised skins that were traded to North America, mainly between 1978 and 2000. However, evidence indicates a heavy, unrecorded, illegal trade involving live animals and scales took place simultaneously, potentially involving an additional 500,000-935,000 Sunda Pangolin (Challender <em>et al.</em> 2015). Challender <em>et al.</em> (2019) estimated that trafficking in Asian pangolins between 2001 and 2018 potentially involved &gt;280,000 individuals, most of which involved this species.<br/></p><p>The pervasive snaring throughout South East Asia (Gray <em>et al</em>. 2017b) means Sunda Pangolins, like all ground-dwelling mammals, are at risk of accidental mortality or injuries in most forests across the region. Local use also comprises a threat, though evidence suggests this is now largely forgone in favour of international trade, given the high monetary value of this species (Newton <em>et al. </em>2008, MacMillan and Nguyen 2013). Hunting and poaching of the Sunda Pangolin may take place to meet subsistence needs and the ultimate driver is absolute or relative poverty, though in some areas poaching appears to be opportunistic and undertaken by hobbyists as well as organised criminal syndicates (Pantel and Anak 2010). It is compounded by the ease with which the species can be captured once found, ineffective and insufficient enforcement in most range states and a lack of resources dedicated to conservation efforts. It is thought that icreasing demand combined with a decreasing supply of Sunda Pangolins has resulted in poaching in areas that were previously considered too costly and inaccessible for hunting.</p><p>This species is known to be harvested for international trade in both live animals and scales in Myanmar, as evidenced by seizures in China (Challender and Waterman 2017). Myanmar, on the basis of its geographic position, size and weak government, has emerged as an important transit country for the smuggling of pangolins to China; although the origin of pangolins is often unclear, trade seems to comprise a mixture of pangolins from Myanmar and neighbouring countries (Nijman <em>et al.</em> 2015). The northern Myanmar region has been identified as a potential transit and source place for the illegal trade of pangolins and their scales (Zhang <em>et al.</em> 2017).<strong></strong><em></em><u></u><sub></sub><sup></sup><br/></p>  <p>The population in the southern part of Thailand has crashed because of trade and in the last few years many pangolins have been confiscated from illegal traders (Challender and Waterman 2017). This species is hunted by specially trained dogs, which can smell it out, making hunting much more effective. Habitat loss, often in the form of deliberate and accidental burning of forests, constitutes a secondary threat to the species here.</p><p>  </p><p></p><p>In Cambodia, the threat to the Sunda Pangolin from hunting and poaching is increasing due to rising prices, and loggers are expending more effort hunting pangolins due to a decrease in luxury wood in the forest (A. Olsson pers. comm. 2013). Pangolins are also often hunted using trained detection dogs and certain villages (e.g., those around Botum Sakor National Park, Koh Kong) are known to specialise in training and deploying such dogs (T. Gray in litt. 2017). In protected areas in the Northern Plains complex, local villagers are financially rewarded for simply reporting pangolin signs to local traders and middlemen (A. Suzuki in litt. 2017).</p>  <p>In Lao PDR, interviews with villagers in the 1990s suggested populations had declined by up to 90% within a decade (i.e., between the 1980s and 1990s; Duckworth <em>et al.</em> 1999), though there is a lack of hard data supporting this (J.W. Duckworth pers. comm. 2006). Consequently, trafficking in the last decade (2009-2019) has originated or been exported from Malaysia and Indonesia, and is destined for China, based on seizure data (Challender and Waterman 2017). Both Lao PDR and Thailand play a key role as transit countries in regional trade involving live animals. Lao PDR is being exploited as a low-risk transport hub for illegal wildlife goods, including pangolins. Lao PDR’s weak laws and ineffective enforcement allow pangolins from both Asian and African countries to be shipped through the country and into consumer countries, such as China and Viet Nam. Between 2010 and 2015, Lao PDR was involved in a total of 43 reported trafficking incidents, in which it was either a seizure (2.3%), origin (32.6%), transit (44.2%) or destination country (23.3%). Thirty-three incidents (76.7%) exclusively involved Asian countries (meaning they did not involve African or non-range countries), and accounted for an estimated ~3,015 pangolins. Based on seizure data from (2010-2015), Asian pangolin species are often smuggled from Indonesia or Malaysia into Lao PDR through Thailand and involve both live and dead or frozen pangolins (Gomez <em>et al.</em> 2016, Challender and Waterman 2017).</p>  <p>Eighty-four hunters in Viet Nam were interviewed and every one reported that they now sell all pangolins that they catch (Newton <em>et al.</em> 2008). Prices are so high that local, subsistence use of pangolins, for either meat or their scales, has completely halted in favour of selling to the national or international trade (MacMillan and Nguyen 2013, Nuwer and Bell 2013). The only occasions on which a hunter might eat a pangolin is if it is already dead when they retrieve it from a trap, then they would use the meat and sell the scales (P. Newton, pers. comm.). The price per kg of pangolin, paid to hunters (in Viet Nam at least) escalated rapidly in the decade up to 2007 and since the commercial trafficking in pangolins began to expand in about 1990 (P. Newton pers. comm.). The main threat in Viet Nam remains hunting therefore, including taking pangolins caught as non-target species. This species is in demand in urban centres such as Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City both for meat – a luxury product –&#160; and scales, and which is attributed to increasing affluence following economic reforms in the late 20th century. Viet Nam is a persistent consumer market in Asia for wildlife species and this is a key factor in the decline of the species in Viet Nam and surrounding regions (Shairp <em>et al.</em> 2016). After two decades of rapid economic growth, newly wealthy consumers are purchasing wildlife to advertise their status, including luxury wild meats the price of which is usually associated with the rarity of a species and its wild origins. Pangolins are often the most expensive meat on the menu in Vietnamese restaurants (Challender <em>et al.</em> 2015, Shairp<em> et al.</em> 2016).</p><p>  </p><p></p><p>Malaysia has been experiencing targeted hunting and poaching almost exclusively for international trade in meat and scales in recent years and though this includes foreigners, it mostly involves Malaysian nationals. Reported price increases have acted to create a strong incentive to poach and enter the species into national and international trafficking (Pantel and Anak 2010, Chong <em>et al</em>. 2016). This is attracting poachers from outside the country (J.L. Chong, unpubl. data). Increasing land conversion for palm oil throughout Malaysia has created easy road access for poachers. The longevity of palm oil cycles (i.e. the removal of old palms and the replanting of new, which occurs on average every 25 years, suggests that where this species does persist in these habitats (Chong <em>et al.</em> 2016), it may not be viable in the long term, though further research on such dynamics is needed. Malaysia also plays a key role as a transit country for the movement of pangolins, mostly live individuals and meat, from Indonesia to China (Challender and Waterman 2017).&#160;</p><p>  </p><p></p><p>Indonesia has been illegally exporting large numbers of live pangolins as well as meat, especially since 2000, some of which comes from east Kalimantan (Sopyan 2009). Targeted hunting and poaching is the biggest threat in Indonesia, especially on Sumatra, Kalimantan and Java, as evidenced by seizures involving several thousands pangolins over the last two decades (Pantel and Chin 2009, Sopyan 2009).</p>  <p>In Singapore, roadkill is seemingly the biggest threat to this species and though poaching does occur here, it is not thought to be a significant problem.<strong></strong><em></em><u></u><sub></sub><sup></sup><br/></p><p>Secondary threats include habitat loss, largely driven by commercial operations, such as logging, mining and hydro-power dams, and the construction of roads, which has facilitated hunting and poaching by opening previously inaccessible areas. Across Lao PDR, Cambodia and Indonesia this has occurred even within protected areas. The conversion of primary forest to agricultural land is a major driver of habitat loss. This is particularly common in Malaysia and Thailand with habitat replaced with large-scale oil, rubber and paper and pulp plantations. The severity of the threat from habitat loss is not well understood given the species' ability to survive in modified landscapes. However, the ability of the species to persist long-term in habitats such as oil palm and rubber plantations is unknown and commands research attention.</p>","<p>There are very little quantitative data on Sunda Pangolin populations at any level (local, national or international), with the exception of Singapore (see below). This species is rarely observed, principally because of its increasing rarity, but also because it is secretive, elusive and primarily nocturnal. There is a paucity of research on population densities at all scales (Willcox <em>et al.</em> 2019). However, population declines are inferred in various places based on the knowledge of local community members and indigenous peoples and from shifting trade dynamics, both legal and illegal. For instance pangolins are now being poached in South Asia (India, Nepal, Bangladesh, Pakistan (Mahmood <em>et al.</em> 2012, Mohapatra <em>et al.</em> 2015), and Africa to meet demand which has been met from Southeast Asia in recent decades, mainly Malaysia and Indonesia (Challender and Hywood 2012, Gomez et al. 2016, Challender and Waterman 2017, Heinrich <em>et al.</em> 2017), following declines in populations of the Sunda Pangolin in the north of its range and Chinese Pangolin (Zhang 2008, Chong <em>et al.</em> 2019)</p>  <p>This species is now extremely rare in the northern part of its range where there have been massive declines in Indochina (Duckworth <em>et al.</em> 1999, Nooreen and Claridge 2001). </p>  <p>It is listed as Endangered in Viet Nam (Nguyen, 2007). In three areas of Viet Nam where interviews were conducted (Khe Net Protected Area, Ke Go Nature Reserve and Song Thanh National Park), 95% of hunters believed pangolins populations have declined severely, because of hunting pressure (Newton <em>et al.</em> 2008). Hunters reported that populations had massively declined in the last few decades, but particularly since about 1990, when the commercial trade in pangolins began to escalate (Newton 2007). In all three areas, the species was described as now being extremely rare. The intense biodiversity survey effort and extremely limited number of confirmed records of pangolins throughout Viet Nam's protected areas adds weight to this observation (see Newton <em>et al.</em> 2008). The rarity of the species was highlighted in more recent research in U Minh Thuong National Park (Nuwer and Bell 2013) and Quang Nam Province (MacMillan and Nguyen 2013). </p>  <p>The species was listed as ‘Rare’ in Cambodia in 2003. There are no population estimates for the country but it is suspected the species is in decline. In a number of reserves in the Cardamom Mountains, this species is present but populations are heavily suspected to be declining. This includes the Elephant Mountains, Central Cambodian Lowland Forests (Prey Long), Eastern Plains Landscape, Northern Plains and Northeast Cambodia. Interviews with hunters suggest that the species is absent in some of these areas, which is attributed to hunting (A. Olsson pers. comm. 2013), and it is likely that these declines have continued since this appraisal.&#160;</p>  <p>In three separate areas within the range of the Sunda Pangolin in Lao PDR (Xe Pian, Dong Phou Veng and Khammouan Limestone National Biodiversity Conservation Area [NBCA]), villagers reported in the late 1990s that pangolin populations had declined due to hunting; in some areas, to as little as one percent of numbers 30 years ago, i.e. (since the 1960s; Duckworth <em>et al.</em> 1999, Nooren and Claridge 2001). The species has largely been extirpated from the lowlands in Lao PDR and is being exploited where areas that were not previously accessible are opening up due to development, including the expansion of agro-industrial plantations (D. Willcox, pers. comm.). </p>  <p>In Peninsular Malaysia, the species has previously been described as common in some areas, at least up until 1999 (Ickes and Thomas 2003). It was listed as Vulnerable in Peninsular Malaysia in 2012. Azhar <em>et al.</em> (2013) report its presence in oil palm plantations in Selangor and Negri Sembilan, though it is subject to very heavy hunting pressure here. According to Numata <em>et al.</em> (2005) the species is present in Pasoh Forest Reserve. Based on recent camera trap data, the species is also present in the Kenyir Wildlife Corridor (D.W.S. Challender, pers. comms. 2013) and also as roadkill in Kenyir (J.L. Chong, J. L. pers. comm. 2017). However, interviews with hunters and villagers in 2007 and 2011 indicate populations in Peninsular Malaysia are decreasing as a result of hunting pressure for trade (D.W.S. Challender, unpubl. data, J.L. Chong, unpubl. data). This is supported by results of pangolin hunting frequency and patterns of the Orang Asli in Kelantan, Pahang and Terengganu (Chong <em>et al.</em> 2016).&#160;&#160; </p>  <p>In Sabah, the Sunda Pangolin has previously been considered relatively common, but there is little recent data on the species' status here. Populations are under pressure from collection for both local use and international trafficking, which seems to have intensified in recent years, and is inferred to be having a detrimental impact on population levels. For example, Pantel and Anak (2010) report that &gt;22,000 Sunda Pangolin were collected for illicit export in the state in an 18 -month period in Sabah between 2007 and 2009. In February 2019, local authorities seized ~30 tonnes of Sunda Pangolins in Sabah, involving frozen animals, live animals and their skins and scales (Anon 2019).&#160;&#160;</p>  <p>In Sarawak, recent data are lacking, but it is believed that populations are under heavy collection pressure for local use, mostly as Sunda Pangolin meat is favoured as a protein source, but the species is also in trade and it is inferred to be causing a decline in the wild populations (J.L. Chong unpubl. data).&#160; </p>  <p>There is a small population in Singapore that might be stable. A recent estimate put the population in the country at 1068 individuals (D. Fung Yu En, unpubl. data). The species is listed as Critically Endangered in Singapore (Davison <em>et al.,</em> 2008).</p>  <p>There is no recent data on the status of this species in Myanmar; though seizures involving the Sunda Pangolin in China in recent years infer that trade originated in Myanmar, suggesting populations of this species here are under threat (Challender and Waterman 2017). It is thought the Sunda Pangolin has been lost from lowland areas due to hunting and habitat conversion to agricultural land.&#160;&#160; </p>  <p>The Sunda Pangolin is considered threatened and is becoming increasingly rare in Thailand (Bain and Humphrey 1982).<br/></p>  <p>Evidence from seizures involving this species attest that it is present in some numbers in Indonesia (including Sumatra, Java and Kalimantan). However, the magnitude of international trafficking originating from Indonesia in the last decade suggests populations here are, or could be, in severe decline. Stating categorically that this is the case is difficult due to a lack of information on past or present population levels, and warrants further research. The estimated generation length of seven years, the indiscriminate nature of poaching and the magnitude of seized trade supports this assertion (Challender and Waterman 2017). For example, there have been seizures comprising 11, 14 and 17 tonnes of Sunda Pangolins between 2000 and 2013, each of which involved several thousand animals, and which likely comprises only a fraction of the trade, based on low detection rates associated with illegal wildlife trade. In Bali, local people report that thirty years ago pangolins would wander into household gardens around Ubud and central Bali whereas now it is hard to find them. Apparently, the northern parts of Bali have higher abundance but the species is generally very rare (H. Nash, unpubl. data).</p>",Decreasing,"<p>The Sunda Pangolin is widely distributed geographically, occurring across mainland and island Southeast Asia, from central Myanmar south through western, southeasterrn and southern Thailand, lowland Lao People's Democratic Republic (PDR), central and southern Viet Nam, Cambodia, Peninsular Malaysia and Singapore. It then occurs on Sumatra, Java and adjacent islands (Indonesia), and Borneo (Malaysia, Indonesia and Brunei Darussalam) and surrounding islands. The northern and western limits of its range are poorly known (Schlitter 2005). Wu <em>et al.</em> (2005) note the occurrence of the species in Yunnan Province, southwestern China based on specimens at the Kunming Institute of Zoology, but there is uncertainty over the provenance of these specimens and thereby occurrence of the species in China (Chong <em>et al. </em>2019). Further details on distribution within each range state are provided below. &#160;&#160;</p><p>Altitudinal limits are not well understood, but in the northern part of its range the species probably does not widely occur above 600 m asl (J.W. Duckworth pers. comm. 2006). Moreover, individuals in captivity north of the Sunda Pangolin’s estimated geographic range have high mortality rates, often dying from exposure due to colder temperatures (Carnivore and Pangolin Conservation Program, unpubl. data). On Borneo, the species has been recorded up to 1,700 m asl at Mount Kinabalu (Payne <em>et al.</em> 1985) and there is a specimen in the Natural History Museum in London from 1,500 m asl. from Lombok, Indonesia (P. Newton, unpubl. data). Kaicheen and Mohd-Azlan (2018) recorded the species at &gt;1,200 m in the Mt. Penrissen area, Sarawak. Despite being present in a number of protected areas (PAs - see the Conservation section) across its range, these are mostly located in poorly accessible areas – either they are at high altitudes or they have steep terrains – meaning they offer limited protection for the Sunda Pangolin, as it is mostly found at altitudes below 1,000 m asl in Indochina, Myanmar and Thailand. It is suspected that the species has been extirpated from some lowland areas of Lao PDR, Myanmar and Thailand, and is highly vulnerable in other lowland areas in these countries as well as Cambodia and Viet Nam.</p><p>It appears likely that the detectability of pangolins from conventional large mammal focused camera trapping is low, thus data (or its absence) from camera trap by-catch information may not provide as much value for pangolins as many other species of ground-dwelling mammals in tropical Asia. For example, the Sunda Pangolin was detected from 11 of 65 randomly set-up camera trap stations (across ~8,000 camera trap nights) in the <a name=""_Hlk12368739"">Southern Cardamom National Park, Cambodia</a>, despite no previous records from more than 22,000 camera-trap nights previously in the landscape (Gray <em>et al</em>. 2017a).</p>  <p>This species is distributed in central and southern Myanmar (Salter 1983, Corbet and Hill 1992), but has apparently been eradicated widely from lowland areas due to human agricultural expansion and hunting (J.W. Duckworth pers. comm. 2006). The species has been recorded in the Tanintharyi region in the south (Challender and Waterman 2017). Moo <em>et al.</em> (2017) recorded<em> Manis</em> spp. in Karen State in Myanmar which likely comprises this species. Rao <em>et al.</em> (2005) recorded this species in Hkakborazi National Park in northern Myanmar in the early 2000s but there is uncertainty over the species identification (M. Rao, pers. comm.) and this record may refer to the Chinese Pangolin (<em>Manis pentadactyla</em>)<em>.</em><br/></p><p><em></em>The species historically occurred throughout Thailand (Lekagul and McNeely 1977, Bain and Humphrey 1982), but, like in Myanmar, has reportedly been lost from most of the lowland areas due to agricultural expansion and hunting/poaching (J.W. Duckworth and R. Steinmitz pers. comm. 2006). Camera-trap data confirms the presence of the species in <a name=""_Hlk12368865"">Khao Yai National Park</a> (ZSL 2017) and there are records from Khao Ang Ru Nai Wildlife Sanctuary (Jenks et al., 2012), Kaeng Krachan National Park (W. Sodsai, unpubl. data), Khlong Nakha Wildlife Sanctuary, and the southeastern western forest complex (sWEFCOM) in Kanchanaburi Province (ZSL, 2017), as well as Hala-Bala Wildlife Sanctuary in the far south (Kitamura et al., 2010). The species occurs also on islands e.g., Ko Ra, Phang Nga Province (GVI, unpubl. data).<strong></strong><em></em><u></u><sub></sub><sup></sup><br/></p><p>Recent research suggests the species is present but rare in central and southern Viet Nam (MacMillan and Nguyen 2013, Nuwer and Bell 2013), however records from these areas vary in reliability. There are older records from Kon Tum Province, Tay Ninh Province and Quang Nam Province (Bourret 1942). Meanwhile, there are more recent records (summarised by Newton 2007) from Ha Tinh Province (Timmins and Cuong 1999), Kien Giang and Ca Mau Provinces (in <a name=""_Hlk12372231"">U Minh Thuong National Park</a>) (CARE 2004), Dong Nai, Bin Phuoc and Lam Dong Provinces (<a name=""_Hlk12372258"">Cat Tien National Park</a>) (Murphy and Phan 2001), Quang Binh (Le <em>et al</em>. 1997a), and Dak Lak (Le&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1997b). Recent enforcement activity suggests the species is still present in Dak Nong, Kon Tum, Quang Binh and Gia Lai provinces (L. Fletcher and A. Nguyen, unpubl. data). Based on camera trap data, the species is also present in <a name=""_Hlk12372414"">U Minh Ha National Park </a>(Willcox <em>et al.</em> 2017). Additionally, camera trap records from December 2012 to August 2014 recorded this species in <a name=""_Hlk12372454"">Thua Thien Hue and Quang Nam Saola Reserves in central Vietnam </a>(T. Gray <em>in litt</em>. 2017). The species was recorded in 2013 in Cat Tien National Park (Save Vietnam’s Wildlife, unpubl. data). Surveys using trained detection dogs have recorded the species in Cat Tien National Park and camera-trapping has recorded it in Pu Mat National Park (Save Vietnam’s Wildlife, unpubl. data), though it is unknown whether these were released animals. A Sunda pangolin was observed at night during reptile and amphibian surveys in Pu Mat National Park in 2014 (S. Trageser, pers. comm<em>. </em>2018) and it has been camera-trapped in Bach Ma National Park (A. Wilting, pers. comm. 2017).</p><p>This species was likely widespread in Lao PDR historically. There are records of varying reliability from a wide range of areas below <em>ca</em> 600 m asl. However, it is possible that in Lao PDR the species is restricted to the Mekong plain and adjacent foothills up to <em>c. </em>900 m asl, with a possible occurrence on the Bolaven Plateau, north from <a name=""_Hlk12372677"">Xe Pian National Biodiversity Conservation Area </a>in the south and at least as far north as Nam Kading (Duckworth&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1999, J.W. Duckworth pers. comm. 2006). Nooren and Claridge (2001) reported that populations in Lao PDR have been severely reduced as a result of hunting for consumption and trade. Camera trap data from Nakai-Nam Thuen in 2016 recorded six instances of pangolins at six different stations, however as the range of the Sunda and Chinese Pangolins overlap here, it was not possible to identify the species (Coudrat 2017).<br/> <br/> In Cambodia, the Sunda Pangolin has been recorded from sea level to 830 m asl (A. Olsson pers. comm. 2012, T. Gray <em>in litt</em>. 2017) and historically occurred throughout deciduous forest, lowland and mountainous evergreen forest, and secondary forest prior to the extensive hunting driven declines that have likely occurred in the past 10-20 years. Extensive recent (meaning post-2012) camera trapping conducted across many of the country’s protected landscapes has generated very few records of this species (though as noted previously, it is difficult to detect pangolins within general large mammal focused camera trapping). For example, there are no post-2008 camera trap records of the Sunda Pangolin from Cambodia’s Eastern Plains Landscape despite more than 100,000 trap nights and a small number (less than five since 2012) of confiscations by law enforcement teams (R. Crouthers, O. Griffin and T. Gray <em>in litt</em>. 2017). However, there have been two records since 2010 from camera trapping in deciduous dipterocarp dominated areas of Preah Vihear Province in the Northern Plains (Songkom Thmey District, May 2017, G. McCann <em>in litt</em>. 2017, and Chep Wildlife Sanctuary (Suzuki <em>et al</em>. 2017) and one from the evergreen forest in Virachey National Park, Rattanakiri, at 830 m asl (McCann and Pawlowski 2017). The Songkom Thmey record was obtained from proactively investigating a “a small tunnel-like game trail” and further emphasises that targeted camera trapping may be necessary to detect the species. There have been more than 10 camera trap records since 2016 from low to mid (10-500 m asl) elevation evergreen forest in the Southern Cardamom National Park and northern Botum Sakor National Park, Koh Kong province (Gray <em>et al</em>. 2017a). It is worth noting that at least two of the recent camera trap records were obtained from small sites managed for ecotourism. This level of intense benign human activity may be necessary to prevent hunting and it is possible that extinction in most of the country’s large, but insufficiently staffed or managed, protected areas is inevitable. It seems likely that numbers in Cambodia are depressed to such a level, particularly in accessible areas of the country, that detection during most biodiversity surveys is unlikely. Nevertheless, the species remains regularly confiscated by law enforcement teams throughout the country, with a total of 375 confiscations by the Wildlife Rapid Rescue Team between 2001 and 2016 (Wildlife Alliance <em>in litt</em>. 2017). Furthermore, between four and five individuals are confiscated annually in the landscape by the Wildlife Alliance law enforcement teams (T. Gray <em>in litt</em>. 2017). Other recent records (for example, there are at least two from central Phnom Penh since 2014) may involve individuals that have escaped from wildlife trade, rather than representing wild animals (T. Gray <em>in litt</em>. 2017).</p>  <p>The species is widely distributed geographically in Peninsular Malaysia, primarily in forest, but also in gardens and plantations, including oil palm and rubber plantations (Medway 1977, Numata <em>et al</em>. 2005). It is also found on the island of Penang. Numata <em>et al. </em>(2005) and Ickes and Thomas (2003) note its presence in oil palm and regenerating lowland dipterocarp forest in and around Pasoh Forest Reserve, where it was previously considered common. The Sunda Pangolin<em> </em>remains&#160;present within oil palm plantations in Selangor and Negri Sembilan, Peninsular Malaysia, based on interviews with plantation workers (Azhar <em>et al.</em> 2013). However, Azhar <em>et al.</em> (2013) also report that in areas where interviews have been conducted, it is in decline from hunting for trade. Additionally, the species is present in Kelantan, Pahang and Terengganu, based on interviews with the Orang Asli hunters (Chong <em>et al</em>. 2016), who also reported that the populations there are decreasing (J.L. Chong pers. comm. 2017). Camera trap data from Kelantan and Terengganu produced just a single record of a Sunda Pangolin, despite an effort of 4,364 and 3,453 nights, respectively (Jambari <em>et al</em>. 2015).</p><p>This species is widely distributed on Borneo, including Sabah and Sarawak in Malaysia. It has been recorded in mixed dipterocarp forest and riverine forest (Azlan and Engkamat 2013), as well as remnant forests in this region (Giman <em style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 16px; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-decoration: none; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; white-space: normal; word-spacing: 0px;"">et al. </em>2007).

Panjang, unpubl. dataa). It is rarely seen in Sabah, especially compared to 10 years ago (E. Panjang, unpubl. data). Interviews were conducted with local communities and plantation workers living near Sepilok-Kabili Forest Reserve between 2011-2015 and Lower Kinabatangan Wildlife Sanctuary between 2016-2019. Respondents claimed that pangolins became rare about 20-30 years ago.

The species does appear as part of the bushmeat trade in Sarawak, especially in markets in Kuching, Sibu and Kapit (J.L. Chong pers. comm. 2017). Kaicheen and Mohd-Azlan (2018) recorded the species at &gt;1,200 m in the Mt. Penrissen area in 2015-2017.<br/></p><p>The abundance of this species is understood to be low in the peat-swamp forests of east and central Kalimantan, Indonesian Borneo (S. Cheyne pers. comm. 2012), but otherwise has a widespread distribution in Indonesia on Sumatra, Java, Borneo, Kiau and Lingga archipelago, Bangka and Belitung, Nias and Pagi islands, Bali and adjacent islands (Corbet and Hill 1992), as well as the Great Bunguran Islands (Natuna Islands) on the northwest coast of Borneo (Phillips and Phillips 2018).&#160;In Bali, local people report that thirty years ago pangolins would wander into household gardens around Ubud and central Bali, whereas now it is hard to find them. The northern parts of Bali have a slightly higher abundance, but they are very rare today (H. Nash, unpubl. data). There are also records from Tanggamus and Lampung Barat Districts in West Java, where the species was found in secondary forests and plantations, ranging between 360-900 m asl. The species was reported in Brunei Darussalam by Medway (1977), which is supported by the 'rescue' of a small number of individuals in 2013. It is reported to occur in all four districts in Brunei Darussalam: Brunei Muara, Tutong, Kuala Belait and Temburong (Fletcher 2016).</p>  <p>The species is still found in the wild in Singapore and adjacent islands, including Pulau Tekong and potentially, Pulau Ubin (Lim and Ng 2008). Wildlife Reserves Singapore (WRS) receives around 20 wild pangolins per year – over 80% of which have been successfully released back into the wild.&#160;</p>","<p>This species has historically been exploited across its geographic range. This has primarily comprised hunting for local, subsistence level consumption, as a source of protein, as well as other uses, and for international trade in skins, scales and meat (Harrisson and Loh 1965, Anon 1992, 1999, Challender <em>et al.</em> 2015, Hafiz and Chong, 2016). There were high levels of international trade in skins from across the species' range in the 1970-1990s, most of which were destined for the United States and Mexico for the manufacture and sale of leather goods including boots, shoes and handbags among other leather items (Anon 1999, Challender <em>et al.</em> 2015, Heinrich <em>et al.</em> 2016), while the scales have been used, either in whole or powdered form, as an ingredient in traditional Chinese and Vietnamese medicine, and in other medicines (Anon 1992, 1999). Other uses include for ritualistic and spiritual purposes, such as protection against bad omens (Anon 1992).</p><p>Most trade reported to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) up to the year 2000 involved skins and scales (Challender <em>et al.</em> 2015, Heinrich <em>et al.</em> 2016), but there was also a parallel illegal trade involving substantial numbers of this species comprising a combination of live animals and scales for consumptive purposes that was principally destined to mainland China (live animals) and China, Taiwan (Province of China) and South Korea (scales; Anon 1992, 1999, Li and Li 1998, Wu and Ma 2007, Challender <em>et al</em>. 2015). In the year 2000, CITES introduced zero export quotas for wild-caught Sunda Pangolins traded for commercial purposes (essentially a proxy trade ban). Despite this measure there has been an ongoing illicit trade in industrial volumes of live and dead Sunda Pangolins and their scales since, which culminated in the species being included in CITES Appendix I at CoP17 in 2016. Challender <em>et al</em>. (2015) estimate that this trade may have involved more than 200,000 Sunda Pangolins exported from Southeast Asia and mainly destined for China and Viet Nam (see also Challender and Waterman 2017). In China and Viet Nam pangolin meat is consumed conspicuously as a luxury dish and scales are used in traditional medicines (Shairp <em>et al. </em>2016, Xu <em>et al.</em> 2016). Legislation prohibits the consumption of pangolin meat in China and Viet Nam, and scales in Viet Nam. In China, there is a legal market for pangolin scales which is regulated by the government. Although official Chinese pharmacopeia prescribe scales from the Chinese Pangolin (<em>Manis pentadactyla</em>), Sunda Pangolins are used in traditional medicines in the country (see Challender<em> et al.</em> 2019). Prices for pangolin meat and scales in China and Viet Nam appear to have risen in recent years, plausibly due to a combination of the increasing rarity of Chinese and Sunda Pangolins, increasing demand and the risk to vendors of selling illegal products (Newton <em>et al.</em> 2008, Challender <em>et al. </em>2015). A study on illegal trade in China suggested that illegal in trade in pangolins is considered easier than other wildlife products, such as ivory and rhino horn, because the products are small and easy to conceal, and is high-profit but apparently low-risk. In many parts of the Sunda Pangolin's range it is understood that traditional, subsistence use of pangolins and their products has been replaced by international trade due to the high financial value of pangolin derivatives (MacMillan and Nguyen 2013, Nuwer and Bell 2013).&#160;</p><p>Other markets for illegal pangolin products also exist. The United States has recently been identified as an end-use market for pangolin products (Heinrich <em>et al.</em> 2017).</p><p>Although dated, Martin and Phipps (1996) noted Sunda Pangolin meat, scales and blood for sale in a restaurant in Cambodia. This practice continues today largely for Chinese expats and tourists (T. Gray in litt. 2017). Research suggests that animals caught in Cambodia are traded across the border to meet demand for luxury meat and scales in Viet Nam (D.W.S. Challender, unpubl. data). However, there have been a number of recent trade confiscations of the Sunda Pangolin on the Thailand-Cambodian border, originating from Thailand (Wildlife Alliance in litt. 2017), suggesting Cambodia may also be a transit or demand country for pangolin. Sunda Pangolins are also sourced in Cambodia and demand exists, particularly from Chinese restaurants in the country (Gray <em>et al.</em> 2017b). </p>  <p>Lao PDR and Thailand both play key roles in illegal trade in live animals and scales from Southeast Asia to East Asia (Gomez <em>et al.</em> 2016). Trade routes typically follow Indonesia-Malaysia-Thailand-Lao PDR-China/Viet Nam. Market observations in recent years within the northern regions of Lao PDR revealed an open trade in pangolin scales mostly for use in traditional medicine and to a lesser extent as jewellery (Gomez <em>et al.</em> 2016).</p><p>It is understood pangolin scales, as well as live animals, are sourced from Myanmar for international trade to China (Nijman <em>et al.</em> 2016). Surveys in Mong La, Myanmar, revealed open trade in pangolin scales, skins, live pangolins and pangolin carcasses, including foetuses emerged in wine, which were observed at the central market, specialised wildlife shops, and in front of the restaurants and casinos. The pangolins and their derivatives are believed to be sourced locally, as well as from neighbouring countries (Nijman <em>et al.</em> 2016 ).</p><p>In Malaysia, the scales of this species have been used in the belief that they cure asthma (CITES 2000) and provide protection from spirits (Hafiz and Chong, 2016). However, as above, there is evidence of heavy illicit, international trade in live animals and their scales from both Peninsular Malaysia and Malaysian Borneo, largely to East Asia (Pantel and Anak 2010, Challender and Waterman 2017). In Sabah in 2016, wildlife rangers seized 25 live pangolins after they arrested a local man at a roadblock in Lahad Datu: the Sabah Wildlife Department believed these pangolins were poached from a nearby forest in Lahad Datu (New Strait Times, 2016). The Orang Asli from the Krau Wildlife Reserve in Malaysia will not consume pangolins as they believe the species is an incarnation of the human placenta, and as such, it is taboo to consume it (Hafiz and Chong, 2016). Similarly, the Orang Asli in Pos Pulat, Kelantan, and Sungai Berua, Terengganu, will burn dried pangolin scales to drive away elephants and other wild animals in the jungle (Hafiz and Chong, 2016). The Kadazans in Sabah will use dried pangolin scales to deter crocodiles while in the river (J.L. Chong, unpubl. data). For the Ibans in Sarawak, the scales of the pangolin inspired the pattern called ‘tisik tenggilling’ utilised in the ketapu rotan, which is a helmet type of hat made from coarsely plaited rattan commonly used as part of the Iban cultural dress (J.L. Chong, unpubl. data). Around 50-100 years ago, indigenous people of Sabah (e.g. Kadazan, Dusun, Murut and Rungus) used Sunda Pangolin scales to make vests for their warriors, and for belts to cure arthritis (E. Panjang, unpubl. data). In Sabah, indigenous people who are non-Muslim consume pangolin meat, which they claim cures illnesses like asthma, and drink pangolin blood, which they regard as a tonic. However, because of the high prices offered by middle men, people frequently choose to sell pangolins rather than consume them (E. Panjang, unpubl. data)</p><p>In Indonesia, this species continues to be hunted for local, subsistence use in central and eastern Kalimantan (S. Cheyne pers. comm. 2013, Wirdadeti and Nash, pers. comm. 2016). Practitioners of traditional medicine in Indonesia continue to recommend pangolin scale products for heart conditions and skin disorders (H. Nash, unpubl. data). However, there is voluminous, illicit trade in the animals from Indonesia, largely from Sumatra, and primarily to China and Viet Nam (Pantel and Chin 2009, Challender and Waterman 2017). There is evidence of professional, commercial-scale hunting of the species both in Sumatra, and more widely in Indonesia, solely for the purpose of commercial but illegal international trade (Takandjiti and Sawitri 2016). While this largely involved pangolin skins prior to 2000, for the leather trade to North America (Heinrich <em>et al.</em> 2016), in the last two decades it has involved live animals, their scales and pangolin meat, and which has primarily been destined for China and Viet Nam (Sopyan 2009, Takandjiti and Sawitri 2016, Challender and Waterman 2017).<br/></p>",Terrestrial,"<p>The Sunda Pangolin is protected by legislation in virtually all its range states, being listed as a protected or totally protected which typically prohibits exploitation. There may be customary laws which permit indigenous peoples to exploit the species for subsistence purposes in some range states (e.g. Malaysia). Exceptions include Brunei Darussalam where the species is not specifically listed as protected but does receive protection under broader wildlife and forestry legislation. In China, the species is a State Category II protected species. </p>  <p>The species occurs in a number of protected areas across its range including Cambodia: Chep (Suzuki <em>et al</em>. 2017) and Pream Krasop Wildlife Sanctuaries (McCann and Pawlowski 2017), Southern Cardamom (Gray <em>et al.</em> 2017a), Virachey and Botum Sakor National Parks; Thailand: Khao Yai and Kaeng Krachan National Parks (W.

A number of factors are likely to be contributing to declines, including climate change, pollution and increasing human intrusion or hunting within breeding areas. It is currently considered Near Threatened; but further surveys are required in order to clarify the true magnitude of declines. <p></p>","<p><strong>Behaviour&#160;</strong>The species is migratory (Olsen and Larsson 2003). It breeds between late June and August (although most pairs do not lay until early-July). Most of the colonies in Canada, Greenland and Svalbard hold between 1-100 pairs (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1996, Gavrilo <em>et al.</em> 2007, Volkov de Korte 2000). Breeding numbers in the same colony in any given season is a subject of great inter-annual fluctuations (up to 10 fold) depending on ice conditions (food availability) during the pre-breeding season (Gavrilo 2011a, Eamer <em>et al</em>. 2013). There is also inter annual alteration between different breeding sites (Bangjord <em>et al</em>. 1994, Mallory 2005, Robertson et al. 2007, MacDonald, 1976, Volokov and De Korte, 1996, 2000, Gavrilo 2011a, Spencer <em>et al.</em> 2012). It departs from the breeding grounds during August - first half of October, returning late-February to early-June (Malory <em>et al.</em> 2008, Olsen and Larsson 2003, Volkov and De Korte 2000, Gilg <em>et al</em>. 2010, Spencer <em>et al.</em> 2014). Most active migration occurs in November, with the first birds only arriving on the wintering grounds in December (Bering Sea, southeast Greenland, Davis Strait/Labrador Sea), and with birds from Greenland, Svalbard, and Russia arriving in sequence (Gilg <em>et al. </em>2010). Most of the birds wintering in the Pacific are thought to originate from the largest Russian colonies, Kara Sea Islands and Severnaya Zemlya (Gilg <em>et al. </em>2010). Between July-December, they may travel 50,000 km on average, and even more for individuals that move to the Pacific (Gilg <em>et al. </em>2010). Outside of the breeding season the species is weakly gregarious, occurring singly or in flocks of up to 20 individuals (Snow and Perrins 1998) or up to 2,000 individuals in favourable feeding places (Renaud and McLaren 1982, Lydersen <em>et al.</em> 2014). Larger numbers also gather in the spring at Hooded Seal <em>Crystophora cristata</em> whelping sites, where they feed on carrion and discarded placentae (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1996). The species also regularly follows Polar Bears <em>Thalarctos maritimus</em> to feed on scraps from their kill (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1996). <strong>Habitat</strong> <em>Breeding</em> It breeds on the high Arctic islands north of the July 5<sup>o</sup>C isotherm (Snow and Perrins 1998). Twelve different habitats are described for the species (Gavrilo 2011b) which are grouped into two principal categories: i) relatively inaccessible coastal or inland (up to 50 km from the coast [Wright and Matthews 1980, Gilg <em>et al.</em> 2009]) rocky mountains and cliffs up to 750 m high (Frisch and Morgan, 1979) and ii) a variety of flat-ground habitats including plain polar deserts, gravel and sandy spits, stony plateau, small gravel/bare islands (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1996, Snow and Perrins 1998, Gavrilo 2011b), or even icebergs (MacDonald 1962, Macpherson 1962, Boertmann <em>et al.</em> 2010, Nachtsheim <em>et al</em>. 2016)<strong> </strong>or grounded ice floes (Kristoffersen 1926) as well as abandoned wooden buildings and other human artefacts (Gavrilo 2011b). In general, spatial-territorial patterns of Ivory Gull breeding colonies distribution are affected by the terrestrial predation, mostly by Arctic Foxes <em>Vulpes lagopus</em> (Gavrilo 2011b, 2012)<em>. </em><em>Non-breeding</em> Outside of the breeding season it strongly associates with sea ice (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1996, Gilg <em>et al</em>. 2010, Spencer <em>et al</em>. 2014) with preference for the marginal pack-ice zone. Gulls wintering in Davis Strait were found to persistently use ice areas with predictable and valuable food resources provided by remains of breeding and polar bear kills at the whelping patches of Hooded Seals (Spencer <em>et al.</em> 2016). The timing of formation and recession and extent of sea ice is suggested to play a large role in their distribution and migratory timing (Spencer <em>et al.</em> 2014). <strong>Diet</strong> Its diet consists predominantly of fish, crustaceans, molluscs, and carrion (e.g. seal placentae) (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1996, Mallory <em>et al.</em> 2008, Karnovsky <em>et al</em>. 2009). The species is supposed to occupy upper trophic levels during the entire annual cycle, making it vulnerable to accumulation of toxic substances (Spencer <em>et al.</em> 2014). It feeds mostly by hovering and contact dipping in open leads in ice-filled waters or at the glacier fronts, walking along ice-floe edges and along the sandy beaches, or scavenging on marine mammal remains (Divoky 1976, Renaud and McLaren 1982, Mallory <em>et al.</em> 2008, Karnovsky <em>et al</em>. 2009, Lydersen <em>et al.</em> 2014, Gavrilo&#160;pers. comm<em>.</em>). <strong>Breeding site</strong> The nest is constructed of mosses and available vascular plants, straw and other debris on a snow-free area of broad rock ledges on steep, inaccessible coastal or inland cliffs up to 300 m high; on gravel, sand or clay ground; broken ice-fields and bare, level shorelines with low rocks; or on ledges, logs or roofs of abandoned buildings (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1996, Snow and Perrins 1998, Gavrilo 2011a,b, Mallory <em>et al. </em>2008, Volkov and de Korte 2000), avoiding areas with developed tundra vegetation (Gavrilo 2011b).</p><p></p>","<p>The loss of sea ice due to climate change represents a significant threat to the Ivory Gull as it is reliant on sea ice for breeding and hunting, selecting areas with 40-80% sea ice cover to forage. Decreasing sea ice has been linked to declines in Canada (Gilchrist and Mallory 2005) and changes to sea ice is decreasing the area of overlap with polar bears and seals, which they scavenge from, and is likely to lead to increased competition (Hamilton <em>et al</em>. 2017). Decreasing sea ice has been linked to declines in Canada (Gilchrist and Mallory 2005), as well as more generally across its range (Joiris 2017). Industrial diamond and gold mining in Canada (Bordeur Peninsula of Baffin Island, Severnaya Zemlya Archipelago) is likely causing habitat degradation and disturbance to breeding colonies (Gilchrist <em>et al</em>. 2008).</p><p>This species feeds high up in the trophic chain and is therefore vulnerable to bioaccumulation (Braune <em>et al. </em>2006).&#160;With pollution accumulating in Arctic waters from diffuse sources, the exact sources of pollutants are unknown. The species' reliance on seal and whale blubber makes it particularly vulnerable to heavy metal contamination (Tucker and Heath 1994, Spencer&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014).&#160;Trace heavy metals have been recorded, such as silver, arsenic, cadmium and lead (Braune <em>et al. </em>2006, 2007, Miljeteig <em>et al. </em>2009, Lucia <em>et al</em>. 2015), as well as high levels of pesticides, including organochlorinated pesticides (OCPs), DDT and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) (Lucia <em>et al</em>. 2016).&#160;The levels of OCPs, polychlorinated biphenyls PCBs and mercury in Ivory Gulls are among the highest ever reported in Arctic seabirds (Braune&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2006, Miljeteig&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2009, Lucia&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;2015). Yet, this is not thought to be at high enough concentrations to cause direct mortality. There is a threat from synergistic and additive effects, which are likely to having a sub-lethal effect, shown in other bird species to affect parental behaviour, endocrine distribution and neurological functions, as well as potentially causing reproductive disruptions (Miljeteig <em>et al.&#160;</em>2012, Lucia <em>et al.</em> 2016). Mercury levels are some of the highest reported in Arctic sea birds, and egg concentrations of industrial contaminants exceed published thresholds known to disrupt reproductive success of avian species (Lucia <em>et al</em>. 2015). The concentration of methyl mercury in feathers of Canadian birds increased by a factor of 45 during 1877-2007 (Bond <em>et al.</em> 2015). High levels of selenium may offer some protection against mercury concentrations, but could also damage gulls (Lucia et al. 2016). Chronic oil pollution is suspected. Although there are no records of oiled Ivory Gulls, they would not be expected to reach land or be recorded due to their ecology. Given impact on other, similar species at risk such as Little Auk&#160;<em>Alle alle</em>&#160;and Thick-billed Murre&#160;<em>Uria Iomvia</em>, Ivory Gulls are likely highly to be at risk (Gilchrist <em>et al</em>. 2008).</p><p></p><p>    </p><p>The Ivory Gull has traditionally been hunted in Canada and Greenland and this is thought to have had an effect on their population (Stenhouse <em>et al</em>. 2004a). They have since become fully protected by law in Canada and Greenland (Stenhouse 2004) and, likely as a result of this, shooting is less common. Reports from Russia shows that hunting and egg collection seems to not have a major impact on the population (Gilchrist <em>et al</em>. 2008).</p><p></p>","<p>Using all data obtained recently and the current knowledge on Ivory’s gull biology in Russia, populations have been estimated at 1,000-1,500 breeding pairs on Franz-Josef Land (European Russia), 1,500-3,000 pairs on Severnaya Zemlya; and 1,000-2,500 pairs in the rest of the Kara Sea Islands (Central Asian Russia) (M. Gavrilo, <em>unpubl. data</em>). An estimated 1,000 pairs were recorded in northeast Canada (Hess 2004, Gilchrist and Mallory 2005, Mallory&#160;<em>pers.comm</em>. 2016), 900-2,000 pairs in Greenland between 2000 and 2012 and 800-1,500 pairs in Svalbard between 2001 and 2013 (BirdLife International 2015). Orr and Parsons (1982) recorded aerial estimates of possibly more than 35,000 individuals between Canada and Greenland in 1978-1979, while del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> (1996) estimated possibly 25,000 pairs (75,000 individuals). This gives a total of 58,100-77,200 individuals, rounded here to 58,000-78,000 individuals, roughly equivalent to 38,000-52,000 mature individuals.</p>",Decreasing,"<p>This species has a circumpolar distribution in the Arctic seas and pack-ice during the non-breeding season, while its breeding range is confined to the Arctic Atlantic sector. It breeds from Canadian Arctic Archipelago<strong> </strong>(to<strong> Canada</strong>) through <strong>Greenland </strong>(to<strong> Denmark</strong>), Svalbard <strong>(Svalbard and Jan Mayen Islands </strong>(to <strong>Norway</strong>), and islands of Franz-Josef Land, Severnaya Zemlya and offshore islands in the Kara Sea (to<strong> Russia</strong>). In Russia, there are 55 known sites where Ivory Gulls have bred or have been breeding until now (Gavrilo 2009). During the past 25 years, 38 breeding sites have been confirmed, eight historical sites have been abandoned and 10 remain unsurveyed. Using all data obtained recently and the current knowledge on the species' biology, populations have been estimated at 1,000-1,500 breeding pairs on Franz-Josef Land (European Russia), 1,500-3,000 pairs on Severnaya Zemlya and 1,000-2,500 pairs in the rest of the Kara Sea Islands (Central Asian Russia) (M. Gavrilo, <em>unpubl. data</em>). During the last five years, the numbers of breeding pairs varied greatly between seasons and also inter-annually. For example, the colony on Sedov Archipelago (Severnaya Zemlya) had 2,000 breeding pairs in 2006-2007, but has held between 100 and 1,000 pairs in previous years. Also, the total numbers for five of the monitored colonies dropped from a maximum of 2,720 breeding pairs observed during 1990s-2000s to 450 pairs in 2016. Overall, no large-scale survey covering most of the key colonies during the same single season has been performed after 2006 and, thus, further research is needed to assess the overall Russian population estimate and trend.</p>  Other populations include 1,000 individuals in northeast Canada (Hess 2004, Gilchrist and Mallory 2005, Mallory <em>pers.comm</em>. 2016), 900-2,000 pairs (equating to 2,700-6,000 individuals) in Greenland (BirdLife International 2015), and 800-1,500 pairs (equating to 2,400-4,500 individuals) in Svalbard (BirdLife International 2015). Extrapolations based on aerial estimates suggested &#160;&gt;35,000 individuals between Canada and Greenland in 1978-1979 (Orr and Parsons 1982). The global population is perhaps best placed in the band 58,000-78,000 individuals.<br/> <br/> Recent surveys have revealed a drastic decline in Canadian populations, falling from 2,400 birds in 1987 to 500-700 birds in 2002-2003 (Hess 2004), representing an 80% decline in that period across the Canadian breeding range in all three known nesting habitat types (Gilchrist and Mallory 2005). The species seems to be declining in the south of its Greenland breeding range, while in North Greenland the trends are unclear (Gilg <em>et al. </em>2009).

By the end of the 20th century, under current levels of CO<sub>2</sub> emission more than 80% of the population is projected to be lost, but major changes to sea-ice prevalence are not projected to begin until after 2050. As such, while declines over the next three generations are not expected to exceed thresholds for listing as threatened,&#160;future climate scenarios predict a rapid increase in the rate of population decline, such that without mitigation the species will begin to decline rapidly within one to two generations.","Emperor Penguins are high latitude, ice obligate seabirds; they breed throughout the austral winter, are highly cold adapted and spend their entire lives in the Antarctic region, generally in association with sea ice. The vast majority of colonies are dependent upon land-fast sea ice, which they use as breeding habitat, and upon pack ice that they use as foraging habitat. <br/><br/>Information for most colonies is based upon remote sensing, only available recently, as colony access by researchers is limited. Nevertheless, the general life cycle of the species is reasonably well understood, especially for adults at colonies in the north of the species range.&#160;<br/>Breeding takes place almost exclusively on coastal land-fast sea ice, sometimes tens of kilometers from ocean access.&#160;Only one known colony occurs wholly on land, where the gradation from fast ice to land ice is continuous (Robertson<em>&#160;et al.&#160;</em>2014), while a small number uses available land for parts of their breeding cycle. Four colonies are known to locate at least temporarily onto the top of ice shelves (Fretwell&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2014).<br/><br/>Emperor Penguins breed throughout the austral winter. They arrive at their colonies in late March to April, and lay eggs in May to June. Chicks hatch after about 65 days and fledge in December to January (Stonehouse 1953; Prévost 1953, 1961). Chicks disperse widely often heading north into waters of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (Kooyman and Ponganis 2008, Wienecke&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2010, Labrousse&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2019). Adults moult in summer (January to March) and may travel up to 1200 km to areas of seasonally persistent pack ice, suitable for haul out for several weeks (Kooyman&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2004).<br/><br/>Emperor Penguins feed mainly on fish, krill and cephalopods. The relative importance of these dietary items varies with colony location and season (Cherel and Kooyman 1998, Kirkwood and Robertson 1997, Klages 1989, Wienecke and Robertson 1997)","<p>The species is threatened by the effects of projected climate change, primarily through ongoing and future decreases in sea ice concentration, thickness and duration, which are affected by wind speed and persistence, as well as changes in other climatic variables that affect ocean properties (e.g. Ainley <em>et al.</em> 2010; Jenouvrier <em>et al.</em> 2014, 2017, 2020). Global emissions of CO<sub>2</sub> from fossil fuels and industry have increased on average by &gt;1.5% per year between 2008 and 2017 (Le Quéré <em>et al. </em>2018), and by 1.7% in 2018 leading to a concentration of 407.4 ppm in the atmosphere, despite reductions in some developing countries (Le Quéré <em>et al.</em> 2019). Similarly, atmospheric methane has grown very rapidly each year between 2014 and 2017, and the climate warming impact of methane, if continued at &gt;5 ppb per year in the coming decades, will be highly significant (Nisbit <em>et al.</em> 2019).</p><p>Most climate models agree that future global climate change will lead to reductions in sea ice area of close to 30% (or 40%) in the latter part of the 21st century following medium (or high) emissions scenarios (Bracegirdle <em>et al. </em>2008, 2015, Palerme<em> et al.</em> 2017) and therefore will affect Emperor Penguins (Ainley <em>et al. </em>2010; Jenouvrier <em>et al. </em>2014, 2017). However, it is important to note that already by mid-century, Emperor Penguins are highly likely to be affected as a destabilization of their breeding platforms prior to fledging, seriously diminishes their chances of breeding successfully.</p><p>The decrease of a colony on Emperor Island from c.150 pairs in the 1970s to fewer than 20 pairs by 1999, with the apparent disappearance of the colony by 2009, has been linked to a decrease in seasonally stable sea ice suitable for breeding (Trathan<em> et al.</em> 2011); in the west Antarctic Peninsula region, there has been a statistically significant negative trend in sea ice in March, over the satellite era (IPCC 2019). The colony appears to have moved to a location with more stable ice (LaRue <em>et al.</em> 2015).</p><p>In recent years, until 2014, circumpolar Antarctic sea ice had increased in extent. In September 2014, the extent was over 20.11 million km<sup>2</sup>. Antarctic sea ice extent then rapidly decreased, but since 2016 has increased (IPCC 2019), but remained below the long-term average (see nsidc.org/data/seaice_index; accessed 2 January 2020). Trends in sea ice extent are potentially independent of changes in coastal fast ice: e.g. altered winds may lead to more extensive large-scale sea ice, but possibly reduced fast ice (Ainley <em>et al. </em>2010). Nevertheless, in the long-term, the loss of large-scale sea ice in general means that ultimately fast ice is also affected. Modelled projections of sea ice remain a key issue, including uncertainty about recent sea ice anomalies. As the Antarctic continues to change, hence so too does Emperor Penguin habitat. In the long term, Emperor Penguin habitat is likely to deteriorate to a point where suitable locations occur only in restricted refugia or, in the worst case scenario, may be completely unavailable (Jenouvrier<em> et al.</em> 2020).</p><p>The relocation of Emperor Penguin colonies will be limited by decreases in sea ice thickness and duration, making it more difficult for them to find stable, long-lasting fast ice for breeding (Ainley&#160;<em>et al. </em>2010). Colonies could conceivably move to any area of coastline where breeding habitat remains (e.g. LaRue <em>et al.</em> 2015, Trathan and Fretwell 2019). However, importantly, a simple latitudinal gradient in the loss of sea ice has not occurred and is unlikely in the future (Zwally&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2002, Turner <em>et al.</em> 2009, Trathan <em>et al.</em> 2011, Stammerjohn <em>et al.</em> 2012, Fretwell <em>et al.</em> 2012).</p><p>Reductions in sea ice concentration and duration reduce the buffering capacity of sea ice to shield fast ice from ocean wave energy (Kim <em>et al. </em>2018). Such energy can contribute to disintegration of breeding habitat. In addition, basal melting of glacier around the Antarctic continent is increasing, potentially leading to further destabilization of Antarctic sea ice (Bronselaer <em>et al.</em> 2018, Massom <em>et al.</em> 2018, Rignot <em>et al.</em> 2019, Shen <em>et al.</em> 2018). Thus, existing and potential breeding areas of Emperor Penguins are subject to a variety of pressures and much uncertainty.</p><p>Out of the water, Emperor Penguins are not agile and cannot easily negotiate rough terrain; they are unable to ascend steep slopes, especially with eggs or small chicks, and require relatively flat, gradual access, either to sea ice, or to beaches (Robertson <em>et al.</em> 2014, Trathan <em>et al.</em> 2019). Loss of suitable breeding habitat is therefore one of the most important challenges that Emperor Penguins face. Recently, breeding on ice shelves has been reported (Fretwell <em>et al.</em> 2014). However, this was only possible where the ablation of shelf fronts or the presence of snow bridges enabled access. Similar opportunities in the future may remain limited, as access varies between years (Zitterbart <em>et al.</em> 2014). In a warming environment potentially causing increased calving of ice shelves, opportunities for this might change. Furthermore, if the rates of flow of ice shelves alter, surfaces may be more highly crevassed. In the long-term, moving onto ice shelves may not be a viable strategy (Fretwell <em>et al. </em>2014). Ice-free ground is rare in Antarctica (less than 1% of Antarctica; Burton-Johnson <em>et al. </em>2016) and the probability that suitable rock areas will emerge is difficult to predict.<br/> <br/> Another threat to Emperor Penguins is a change in food availability; changes to ocean circulation due to increasing melt of Antarctic ice may interfere with the natural processes that bring nutrients and carbon from the deep ocean back to the surface waters (Lago &amp; England 2019). How this will affect marine organisms, especially those that penguins rely on for food, is as yet unknown. Furthermore, fisheries for Antarctic silverfish <em>Pleuragramma antarcticum</em>, part of the diet of Emperor Penguins, could be developed in the future. Harvesting of silverfish and Antarctic krill <em>Euphausia superba </em>could pose a threat, if management does not adequately take into account the needs of species that feed upon these species. Protection of habitat at sea is important, with the designation of appropriate protection for transit, foraging, moulting and rafting areas at sea.</p><p>              Human disturbance is a threat in some areas, where problems to colonies are caused by the proximity to scientific bases and aircraft movements (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992). Sites visited by tourists collectively account for a very small percentage of the global population (J. Croxall <em>in litt. </em>2017), but the impacts of tourism on breeding penguins remain uncertain (Trathan <em>et al.</em> 2019). Other human impacts potentially include disturbance from researchers, construction of new science facilities and Antarctic krill fisheries. Oil spills may also be important at local scales.</p>","<p>A survey of satellite images from 2009, updated in 2019 considered 54 colonies containing approximately 256,500 breeding pairs to be a plausible breeding population estimate (Trathan <em>et al. </em>2019). The numbers of juveniles, sub-adults and non-breeders are unknown, and the small colonies found since 2014 are not included.&#160;</p>",Decreasing,"<p><em>Aptenodytes forsteri</em> has a circumpolar range with approximately 54 breeding colonies located around the entire coast of <strong>Antarctica</strong>, (Trathan&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2019). The largest colonies (&gt; 15,000 breeding pairs) occur in the Ross Sea and Weddell Sea. In recent years, some colonies may have relocated (Ancel <em>et al.</em> 2014, LaRue <em>et al.</em> 2015, Fretwell and Trathan 2019).&#160;<br/><br/>Future reduction in the suitable breeding habitat is strongly predicted (Jenouvrier <em>et al. </em>2020) with major changes predicted from the middle of the current century (Bronselaer <em>et al. </em>2018). The breeding habitat of Emperor Penguins is discontinuous, and only a seasonal feature. Extent, thickness and duration of sea ice are all changing, with regional differences. Refugia may continue to exist in the higher latitude Weddell Sea and Ross Sea, but the areas suitable as breeding habitat are likely to be only a fraction of those currently available.&#160;</p><p></p>",,Terrestrial|Marine,"<strong>Conservation Actions Underway</strong><br/>The species is the subject of on-going international research. Most on-the-ground studies have been undertaken at colonies in the northern part of the species range. Less is known about the southern colonies in the Ross Sea or Weddell Sea, where the intensity of winter darkness is much greater and it is colder. Pair bonding, breeding, and laying occur later in these high-latitude colonies (G Kooyman <em>in litt.</em> 2019). The natural history beyond post-moult and before return for breeding are unknown and&#160; only one study, conducted in the eastern Ross Sea, focused on non-breeders (Goetz <em>et al. </em>2018).<br/><br/>Human disturbance is regulated in some areas; to date, seven active breeding sites are designated as Antarctic Specially Protected Areas (ASPA), and seven are protected by the Ross Sea Region Marine Protected Area (RSR MPA), of which three are also designated ASPAs. More colonies may eventually become protected. MPAs may afford protection for different life history processes, including potentially breeding, foraging and moulting, as MPAs may provide for more comprehensive protection than do ASPAs. MPAs are essential to protect food resources while ASPAs only protect breeding areas: the RSR MPA will protect over 1.5 million km<sup>2</sup>&#160;of the Southern Ocean from commercial fishing over the next 35 years (Australian Birdlife 2016).<br/>Currently however, the RSR MPA protects only one of the Emperor Penguin meta-populations proposed by Younger <em>et al.</em> (2015, 2017). Protection of more genetically distinct meta-populations might be important for future resilience to environmental change.<br/><br/><strong>Conservation Actions Proposed</strong><br/>Conduct regular satellite surveys to monitor population trends in the context of habitat availability (e.g. Fretwell <em>et al. </em>2012, LaRue <em>et al. </em>2015).

While it appears that much of its habitat is undisturbed, it is estimated that between 5–15% of subpopulations are currently being impacted by human-induced deforestation, possibly leading to slow declines (J.

The projection that there will be a high demand for this species in the pet trade  (Brown <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>2008) seems to be confirmed in the area surrounding Shucushuyacu, where smuggling pressure has increased considerably, to such an extent that no individuals have been seen in the wild in this area since the species was described (J.

It is suspected, based on its association with arboreal habitat, that some of the subpopulations may be undergoing declines due to human-induced deforestation (J. Brown pers. comm. February 2013). For example, at the type locality Shucushuyacu, about half a dozen visits between 2008-2012 did not record this species suggesting these local collections for the legal pet trade may be affecting the subpopulation there (J.

Pallas’s Cats are generally found at low densities, though in small rich patches in Russia they have been found at much higher density (Kirilyuk and Barashkova 2011). Their low density is believed to be a result of interspecific predation and the resulting habitat specialisation leading to a small percentage of the landscape being suitable for their needs. Due to their general low density and patchy distribution, relatively large areas are required to conserve viable populations (Ross et al. 2019a). Pallas’s Cats are also highly dependent on cavities to provide dens for daily use and rearing young, which further restricts habitat availability (Ross<em> et al.</em> 2010a).</p><p>Predation by sympatric carnivores, herding dogs, and human offtake are the main known causes of mortality, but habitat disturbance and fragmentation is believed to be their main threat (Ross <em>et al.</em> 2019b). Mineral exploitation and infrastructure developments have increased throughout the species range. Pallas’s Cat also continues to be at risk from a declining prey base due to pika (<em>Ochotona</em> spp.) and rodent control programmes leading to prey depletion and secondary poisoning (Ross <em>et al.</em> 2019b).</p><p>Due to the difficulty of observing the species, data generally consist of individual records, and there are no current monitoring programmes that would allow empirical estimates of population size or population trend. However, recent reviews have highlighted that the global population size is unlikely to be low enough to qualify as Near Threatened (Barashkova<em> et al. </em>2019). In addition, we used the methods of Santini <em>et al. </em>(2019) to quantify habitat loss and disturbance across Pallas’s Cats range between 1994 and 2015 (or three generations). The analyses indicated that between these years the change in suitable habitat and level of habitat fragmentation was low, suggesting suitable habitat is likely to be disappearing at a lower rate than previously assumed, and indicating the population may be more stable than thought. Though caution is needed as information on the Pallas’s Cat is incomplete, and threats may be acting at a different scale than our analyses. We also have no information describing the species population dynamics and how the population may track prey availability. Nevertheless, based on distributional data, the Pallas’s Cat population as a whole appears more stable than previously thought leading to its inclusion in the Least Concern category.</p><p>  </p><p>  </p><p>  </p>","<p></p><p>Pallas's Cat is distributed in landscapes with extreme continental climates - little rainfall, low humidity, and a wide range of temperatures. They are rarely found in areas where there is persistent snow cover of depths over 10 cm, and a continuous snow cover of 15–20 cm is thought to mark the ecological limit for this species (Heptner and Sludskii 1972, Kirilyuk and Puzanski 2000, Sunquist and Sunquist 2002). They are generally associated with montane grassland steppe and shrub steppe, but are habitat specialists, selecting habitats providing hiding cover such as ravines, rocky areas, and disruptive vegetation cover that allow them to move through the landscape without being detected by predators (Ross 2009, Ross <em>et al. </em>2012). Their optimal habitat consists of a mix of grassland and shrub steppe with rocky cover, ravines, and hill-slopes. They are rarely found in lowland basins or flat featureless plains, although may access these areas through ravines or other disruptive cover, to access prey or in transit to better habitat (Ross 2009, Barashkova <em>et al. </em>2019, Ross <em>et al. </em>2019b).</p><p>A recent review discussed the general habitat features of Pallas’s Cats’ in Central Asia (Barashkova <em>et al.</em> 2019), Western Asia (Moqanaki <em>et al.</em> 2019), and the Himalaya and China (Dhendup <em>et al. </em>2019). Central Asian habitats were characterised by hills, rocky outcrops, scree slopes, ravines, and rock cover, with petrophytic dry steppe or semi-desert vegetation (Heptner and Sludskii 1972; Sludskii 1982; Kirilyuk and Puzansky 2000; Ross <em>et al.</em> 2010a, b, 2012; Istomov <em>et al.</em> 2016; Barashkova <em>et al. </em>2019).</p><p>In Western Asia, a single record in the Iranian Caucasus suggests Pallas’s Cat uses open, hilly steppes and shrubland, with rocky outcrops and scattered trees (Aghili<em> et al. </em>2008). In Iran, the Pallas’s Cat occurs across a wide continuum of habitats, from arid grass­land steppes and dry mountains to temperate open shrublands. In Afghanistan, habitat consists of arid plateaus with flat and rolling mountains interspersed by rocky and deep valleys. In Pakistan, the species prefers alpine and sub­alpine scrub, dominated by rugged and broken terrain with high cliffs, ridges and ravines. In Turkmenistan, the species is predominantly associated with mountains and foothills (Heptner and Sludskii 1972, Rustamov and Hojamyradov 1994, Chalani <em>et al.</em> 2008, Joolaee<em> et al. </em>2014, Farhadinia et al. 2016, Talebi Otaghvar<em> et al. </em>2017, Adibi<em> et al. </em>2018, Moqanaki <em>et al.</em> 2019). In Turkmenistan, the species is historically considered rare (Shukurov 1962) and predominantly associated with mountains and foothills of the Kopet Dag and the Big Balkan range (A. Potaeva and T. Rosen, pers. comm. 2019, Shukurov 1962). Pallas’s Cat has also been found in juniper woodland (<em>Juniperus </em>spp.) in Pakistan and Iran (Hameed <em>et al.</em> 2014, Dibadj <em>et al.</em> 2018). In Western Asia, the median elevation of Pallas’s Cat records is 2,372 m (range: 894–3,665 m), which corresponds to a mid-mountain elevation (Moqanaki <em>et al.</em> 2019).</p><p>There are fewer records or accounts of Pallas’s Cat habitat in the Himalaya and China region, meaning we are unable to assess the importance of different habitat types. However, habitats of the region are generally of higher elevation with some of the highest elevation records found for the species (Fox and Dorji 2007, Chanchani 2008, Werhahn <em>et al. </em>2018, Dhendup <em>et al.</em> 2019, Pal <em>et al.</em> 2019). In Bhutan, with its warmer south-facing Himalayan slopes, Pallas’s Cat is found in rolling hills dominated by glacial out-wash and alpine steppe vegetation (<a name=""_Hlk10972711"">WWF 2012</a>, Thinley 2013). Pallas’s Cat occurs in Nepal in upper Manang valley within broken and rocky habitats, rolling hill slopes with few cliffs, and in Dolpo in rocky hill slopes within montane grassland steppe (Shrestha <em>et al.</em> 2014, Lama <em>et al.</em> 2016, Regmi <em>et al.</em> 2016). In India, the majority of records are from the Trans-Himalayan landscapes of Ladakh and Sikkim (Prater and Barruel 1971, Mallon 1991, Mahar <em>et al.</em> 2017, Pal <em>et al.</em> 2019). In the Tibetan region Pallas’s Cat has been reported in desert steppe habitat at 5,050 m dominated by <em>Stipa</em> spp. (Fox and Dorji 2007) and in mountainous alpine meadows in Qinghai (Li <em>et al. </em>2013) and Mountain steppe in Sichuan (Webb<em> et al.</em> 2014, 2016).</p><p>The observed large-scale habitat associations of Pallas’s Cat, which all contain some form of disruptive or hiding cover, can be explained by Pallas’s Cat being under constant risk of predation by sympatric aerial and terrestrial carnivores (Ross 2009). We have evidence of predation by numerous large raptors, and carnivores such as the grey wolf (<em>Canis lupus</em>), herding dogs, and red foxes (Vulpes vulpes), they are also hunted by humans (Ross 2009, Barashkova and Smelansky 2011; Ross <em>et al.</em> 2012, 2019b), other large carnivores, such as snow leopard, may also opportunistically predate Pallas’s Cat where they co-exist. The Pallas’s Cat is not a fast runner and when threatened by other predators its best line of defence is hiding out of sight, relying on their excellent camouflage and taking cover in burrows (of marmots or sympatric carnivores) or in rock crevices. In general, open areas without suitable cover are avoided and habitats with disruptive cover such as ravines, rocky areas, shrub-steppe, and hill-slopes are highly selected (Ross 2009, Ross <em>et al.</em> 2010a). As a result, Pallas’s Cat uses only a small fraction of habitats available within the steppe ecosystem. Their habitat selection and specialisation is the most likely explanation for their low densities (Ross <em>et al.</em> 2016, 2019a), and should be accounted for in expert knowledge-based estimates of their potential population size.</p><p>Pallas’s Cat also has a dependency on refuges or dens. Dens are used on a daily basis to provide important cover from predators, for feeding, mating, giving birth, raising young, and for thermoregulation during the extremely cold winters (Ross <em>et al</em>. 2010a). Den availability is thought to be critical for survival, and a critical habitat requirement for their conservation (Ross 2009, Ross <em>et al.</em> 2010a). Dens mostly consist of marmot burrows and rock crevices (Ross <em>et al.</em> 2010a), in Southern Siberia and Kazakhstan the den sites of sympatric carnivores are more commonly used (Ross<em> et al</em>. 2019b), and in Iran Pallas’s Cat has been observed using aged Juniperus excelsa tree cavities as breeding dens (Dibadj <em>et al. </em>2018). Despite the range of habitats used by the species, the presence of suitable cavities appears to be a standard niche requirement (Ross <em>et al.</em> 2019a).</p><p>The annual home ranges of Pallas’s Cat are unusually large for a small felid. Researchers in Mongolia</p><p>have measured mean annual home ranges as follows (Ross<em> et al.</em> 2012):</p><p>Female = 95% kernels 23.1 +/- 8.9 km²; 100% MCP = 64.1+/-18.6 km²; n = 13</p><p>Male = 95% kernels 98.8 +/- 17.2 km², 100% MCP = 159.0 +/- 59.3 km²; n = 9</p><p>&#160;</p><p>Radio-tracking studies of Pallas’s Cat in the Daursky State Nature Reserve (Zabaikalsky Krai, Russia)</p><p>calculated the following ranges (Barashkova and Kirilyuk 2011):</p><p>Female = 95% kernels 6.0 +/- 3.4 km²; 100% MCP = 10.0 +/- 6.5 km²; n = 4 </p><p>Male = 95% kernels 22.9 +/- 12.9 km²; 100% MCPs = 16.5 +/- 9.4 km²; n = 3</p><p>Pallas’s Cat diet is mainly composed of small lagomorphs and rodents, it is known to be a pika (Ochotona spp.) specialist (Ross et al. 2010b). Pikas are the most important prey across its range, typically comprising over 50% of the diet and highly selected over other prey species (Heptner and Sludskii 1972, Ross et al. 2010b). As pikas are 2–4 times larger than other common small mammal prey, Pallas’s Cat preference for them optimises hunting efficiency and energy intake. They also consume gerbils, jirds, voles, hamsters and ground squirrels; less frequently consumed prey includes small birds, young marmots, hares, hedgehogs, reptiles, and invertebrates (Kirilyuk 1999, Ross <em>et al.</em> 2010b, Adibi <em>et al.</em> 2018, Werhahn <em>et al. </em>2018, Barashkova <em>et al.</em> 2019, Moqanaki<em> et al.</em> 2019). Pallas’s Cats has also been recorded eating berries (Kirilyuk 1999) and scavenging from carcasses (Ross <em>et al.</em> 2010b, 2019b).</p><p>                                                In an assessment of Pallas’s Cat habitat loss and fragmentation at a global scale, E.M. <span class=""A8"">Moqanaki, (unpublished analyses) used the methods of Santini <em>et al.</em> (2019) to quantify habitat loss and disturbance across Pallas’s Cats range (AOO) between 1994 and 2015 (or three generations). The analyses indicated that between these years the change in extent of suitable habitat within EOO (represented by ESA (2015)’s CCI land cover categories 120, 121, 122, 130, 140, 150, 200, 201, 202) and level of habitat fragmentation was very low (below 5%). As previous assessments have used estimates of habitat loss as justification to infer a declining Pallas’s Cat population, the analyses suggests the population is likely to be more stable than previously thought. A more detailed analyses, of habitat loss across the species range, that includes more variables and simulation, is recommended to provide a better indicator of Pallas’s Cat and other steppe species likely status.</p><span class=""A8""><p></p></span>","<p>Pallas’s Cat has several known and tested biological causes of vulnerability, including feeding and habitat specialisation, large home range sizes, making them difficult to protect within reserves, and a dependency on shelters made by other threatened species, such as Siberian marmots Marmota sibirica (Ross 2009, 2010 a,b, 2012).</p>  <p>In most regions, the specialist requirements of the Pallas’s Cat result in its distribution being naturally fragmented, due to resources and habitat patches being se­parated by large areas of poor habitat with insufficient prey or cover from predation (Ross<em> et al.</em> 2016, 2019b). As Pallas’s Cat is predated by sympatric carnivores it has a need for safe refuges, and so has a dependency on marmot burrows and rock cavities, particularly for raising young (Ross <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 2010a). Most marmot species remain non-threatened but the Siberian Marmot, which overlaps Pallas’s Cat’s range in Russia and Mongolia, has declined due to overharvesting and is now classified as Endangered (Clayton 2016). The decline in marmots may result in the loss burrow habitat which is regarded as a keystone resource for Pallas’s Cat in many regions of grassland steppe across its range (Ross <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 2010a).</p>  <p>The most serious threat to Pallas’s Cat across its range is habitat degradation and frag­mentation that are largely consequences of increasing livestock numbers, conversion of steppe grasslands into arable land, infrastruc­ture development and resource extraction. Mineral exploitation and infrastructural developments have also increased substantially across the range with increased frag­mentation as a result (Awehali 2011, Paltsyn <em>et al. </em>2012, Selles 2013; Ross <em>et al. </em>2016, 2019a). Due to degradation and loss of habitat, Pallas’s Cat populations are becoming increasingly fragmented, and isolated subpopulations are very likely disappearing without our knowledge (<a name=""_Hlk10872039"">Ross <em>et al. </em>2019</a>a). In Mongolia, for example, livestock numbers have increased from 26 million in 1991 to 66 million in 2018 (FAO 1998, National Statistical Office of Mongolia 2018). Increasing livestock numbers result in heavy grazing and habitat degradation, but also in displacement of Pallas’s Cats and increasing number of herding dogs which are known to kill the species (Ross 2009, Barashkova and Smelansky 2011, Ross <em>et al. </em>2012, Joolaee <em>et al.</em> 2014, Farhadinia <em>et al.</em> 2016, Ruta 2018). In Kazakhstan there is also a threat from farming, as large areas of secondary steppe grassland are being converted into arable pastures endangering local Pallas’s Cat subpopulations by increasing isolation and fragmentation of habitat (<a>A. Barashkova pers. comm. 2019).</a></p>  <p>Predation by herding dogs, feral dogs, acci­dental capture when trapping or snaring other animals, and illegal and legal hunting are the main recorded causes of direct anthropogenic mortality of Pallas’s Cats (Ross 2009, Barashkova and Smelansky 2011, Farhadinia <em>et al</em><em>.&#160;</em>2016, Ross <em>et al.</em> 2016, Ruta 2018, Barashkova <em>et al.</em> 2019, Ross <em>et al.</em> 2019).</p>  <p>New emerging threats are also of con­cern. Climate change for example is predicted to have large impacts on the grasslands and mountain ecosystems of Central Asia and the Himalayas (Angerer <em>et al. </em>2008, Xu <em>et al. </em>2009). The potential impacts of climate change on Pallas’s Cats are unknown, but evidence sug­gests recent changes of the grassland and mountain ecosystems of Central Asia and Himalayas are at least in part related to cli­mate change (Angerer <em>et al.</em> 2008, Xu<em> et al.</em> 2009). Climate change is also predicted to have large impacts on steppe and mountain ecosystems in the future with a cascade of changes to the ecosystem likely to follow (IPCC 2014). As Pallas’s Cat is a strict seasonal breeder, female ovulation and male sperm production are both regulated by day length and peak during the late winter breeding season (Brown <em>et al. </em>2002). Con­sidering that the breeding season is dictated by day length, as opposed to climate, Pallas’s Cats may be unable to respond to seasonal changes in ecological parameters that result from climate change. As indicated by large gains in body mass, Pallas’s Cats build-up en­ergy reserves during the summer when prey is abundant (Ross 2009, Naidenko<em> et al. </em>2014), and invest these reserves in reproduction during the late winter when prey availability is low (Ross <em>et al. </em>2010a). As climate change alters seasonal patterns, and with it prey availability, this is likely to affect Pallas’s Cats’ ability to balance energy reserves (Ross <em>et al.</em> 2019a).</p>  The poisoning of small mammals, such as pikas and Brandt’s vole Lasiopodomys brandtii, is still occurring in the steppe ecosystem, with an aim of reducing disease transmission from small mammals to humans and livestock and improving range­land quality for livestock (Smith <em>et al. </em>2008). Although information is scarce, poisoning continues in China where pika populations can be reduced by 95% (Lai and Smith 2003, Ba­dingqiuying <em>et al. </em>2016). In the Qinghai-Tibe­tan Plateau, for example, between 2006 and 2013 approximately $25.5 million was spent to eradicate the plateau pika (<em>O. curzoniae</em>) from over 78,500 km2 in Sanjiangyuan National Nature Reserve alone (Wilson and Smith 2015). Research has also shown carnivore populations may suffer declines as a consequence of poisoning campaigns (Badingqiuying <em>et al.</em> 2016). In Mongolia, campaigns to control small mammal numbers have occurred in all provinces (Clark <em>et al.</em> 2006, Winters 2006, Ross <em>et al. </em>2016) but there is no informa­tion on its current prevalence. In Russia and Kazakhstan poisoning occurs at a local scale to control local disease outbreaks (Barashkova et al. 2019). Although the occurrence of poisoning has very likely decreased over the last decade, where the practice continues there is little doubt that aerial and terrestrial carnivores will suffer multiple consequences, such as secondary poisoning and prey depletion (Ross <em>et al. </em>2019a).<p></p>","<p>As Pallas’s Cat has a wide yet fragmented distribution across the grasslands and montane steppes of Central and Western Asia, we assume the global population is fragmented into many sub-populations. Due to the difficulty of reliably and repeatedly detecting Pallas’s Cat by any survey protocol, the differentiation of sub-populations and the estimate of population size remains extremely difficult. Nevertheless, several estimates of population density have been made, using several methods. In central Mongolia, an estimate of 4–8 cats/100 km² was made based upon radio telemetry of 28 cats, weekly spotlight surveys, and observations while radiotracking over a period of 2 years, giving confidence that most individuals were observed (Ross 2009). Several population estimates have been made in Russia, based on snow tracking and correction formulas. Snow tracking studies in Russia have suggested that the Pallas’s Cat can periodically occur at very high densities up to 100 cats/100 km² in areas of Dauria (Kirilyuk and Barashkova 2011, Barashkova <em>et al. </em>2017). Confirming the high densities, Naidenko <em>et al.</em> (2014) captured a total of 16 Pallas’s Cats in an area of 16 km², equating to an apparent density of 100 cats/100 km² in Dauria. Though the high density is very likely to be a localised phenomenon, possibly related to prey eruptions. However, given the lack of repeated occurrences of the Pallas’s Cat in many areas across its range, it seems low density (4 cats/100 km²&#160;) is a more applicable average density for the species.&#160;&#160;</p>  In a recent review of Pallas’s Cat in Russia and Central Asia, Barashkova <em>et al.</em> (2019) estimated the potential population size in this region as approximately 49,000–98,000. Though they added the estimate is highly speculative. The estimate also assumed the entire predicted suitable habitat is currently occupied. Based on our understanding of the AOO (based on predictive models of Pallas's Cat occupancy), we estimate the global population of mature Pallas's Cats at approximately 58,000. This is based on the assumption that within the AOO Pallas's Cat has an average density of 4 cats/100 km², and that 20% of the population are immature non-breeders.&#160; Despite the speculative nature of these estimates, they indicate that the population size of Pallas’s Cat almost certainly exceeds the limits specified under the Near Threatened classification.<p></p>",Decreasing,"<p>  </p><p>The Pallas’s Cat primarily occurs within regions of montane grassland and shrubland steppe of Central Asia, but is found as far west as Western Iran and previously extended into Armenia and Azerbaijan (Ross<em> et al.</em> 2016). The core populations of Pallas’s Cat are believed to occur in Mongolia and China (Smith <em>et al.</em>&#160;2008, Jutzeler et al. 2010). In Russia, the Pallas’s Cat occurs along the border with Mongolia and China mainly in the Altai, Tyva, and Buryatia Republics (Altai and Sayan Mountains), and Trans-Baikal Territory (Koshkarev 1998, Barashkova <em>et al. </em>2007). They are found in mountain steppe and semi desert foothills in Central and eastern Kazakhstan (Barashkova <em>et al.</em> 2019), and some areas of Kyrgyzstan (Snow Leopard Trust 2014, Barashkova <em>et al. </em>2019). In Uzbekistan and Tajikistan the species was recorded before the 1960s but not more recently (Barashkova <em>et al. </em>2019).</p><p>Outside Iran, records of Pallas’s Cat in the southwest of its range (also vaguely known as the Caspian Sea range; Southern Caucuses, Turkmenistan, Afghanistan, and Pakistan) are rare and thus the conservation status of the species there is unknown (Habibi 2004, Hameed<em> </em><em>et al.</em> 2014<a name=""_Hlk12187509"">, Farhadinia <em>et al. </em>2016</a>, Moqanaki <em>et al.</em> 2019). Iran appears to have the widest geographic distribution of the Pallas’s Cat in this region, where most of the recent occurrence records are associated with the two main mountain chains of Alborz and Zagros in the north and west, respectively (Karami <em>et al.</em> 2016, Moqanaki <em>et al. </em>2019, Yusefi <em>et al.</em> 2019). In Afghanistan, multiple occurrences have been recently collected from Bamyan Province during camera trap surveys for the Persian leopard (<em>Panthera pardus</em>; WCS 2017). Recent occurrence records from Pakistan are restricted to Gilgit-Baltistan, and there is evidence they inhabit the border area with Afghanistan (<a name=""_Hlk12187460"">Hameed <em>et al.</em> 2014, </a>Hussain 2018). The latest Pallas’s Cat records from Turkmenistan are from Dushak Erekdag in the Kopet Dag, the Turkmen-Khorasan Mountain Range in the borderland with north-eastern Iran (A. Potaeva and T. Rosen, pers. comm. 2019). The species presence in Pakistan’s Baluchistan Province, as well as Armenia and Azerbaijan in the Caucasus, is uncertain (Moqanaki<em> et al</em>. 2019).</p><p>        Recent records from Bhutan, Nepal, and India also suggest Pallas’s Cat presence in the Eastern Himalayan region but at a low density (WWF 2012, Thinley 2013, Shrestha <em>et al.</em> 2014, Mahar<em> et al</em>. 2017, Dhendup <em>et al</em>. 2019, <a name=""_Hlk12187607"">Pal <em>et al</em>. 2019</a>). The highest elevation record for Pallas’s Cat, of 5,593 m, was found in the Himalayan region in Nepal (Werhahn <em>et al</em>. 2018).</p><p>  </p>","<p>The extent of illegal hunting and illegal trade of Pallas’s Cats or their body parts is unknown (Barclay <em>et al.</em> 2019, Ross <em>et al. </em>2019a). It has been reported that international trade in Pallas’s Cat pelts ceased since the late 1980s, and Mongolia is the only range country where hunting of Pallas’s Cat is per­mitted today, although they can be hunted in China if a special license is obtained (Lu <em>et al. </em>2010, Ross <em>et al.</em> 2016, Barclay <em>et al.</em> 2019). The permitting system in Mongolia is said to be ineffective and Pallas’s Cat furs were exported illegally to China (Murdoch <em>et al. </em>2006). It has been estimated that there were about 1,000 legal Pallas’s Cat hunters in Mongolia with a mean harvest rate of 2 Pallas’s Cats per hunter per year (Wingard and Zahler 2006). It is difficult to estimate levels of illegal hunting, though it is likely much higher than the legal level of hunting and is known to happen across all range countries. Evidence of illegal trade in Pallas’s Cat is reported from Afghanistan and Pakistan (e.g. Kretser <em>et al. </em>2012), but it seems to be only occasional and opportunistic, though this may reflect the rarity of Pallas’s Cat. Marmots are commonly hunted in most of the Pallas’s Cats range and Pallas’s Cats are often mistaken for marmots and shot (Ross<em> et al.</em> 2019b). They are also trapped incidentally in leg-hold traps and snares set for other animals (Ross 2009). The fat and organs of Pallas’s Cats are used as medicine in Mongolia and Russia (Ross<em> et al.</em> 2016, Barashkova <em>et al.</em> 2019). A report from Kyrgyzstan suggests that Pallas’s Cat is often harvested in winter by tracking them back to their den and capturing them using snares (T. Rosen pers. comm. 2020). Undoubtably more information on illegal offtake of Pallas’s Cat is needed, as hunting could be a more significant threat than we currently assume, certainly at a local level but possibly also range wide.</p>",Terrestrial,"<p><span class=""A9"">In 2019 a conservation action plan was written to move towards promoting the survival of Pallas’s Cat across its historic range. The action plan has a number of conservation actions including increasing conservation research, education and awareness, decreasing human caused mortality and coordinating conservation efforts. These actions will be implemented over the next 10 years (<span class=""A15"">Pallas's Cat Global Action Planning Group 2019), and consequently, conservation action is expected to increase in the near future.</span></p>  <p>In situ conservation of the species occurs mainly through prohibi­tion or regulation of hunting and trade, and habitat conservation within protected areas (Barashkova et al. 2019; Pallas’s Cat is listed under CITES Appendix II as <em>Felis manul</em>). Hunting of this species is prohibited in most current range countries except Mongolia (Nowell and Jackson 1996), which restricts hunting and regulates trade through a permitting system. Trophy hunters can purchase limited hunting licenses in Mongolia and export trophies (Clark <em>et al</em><em>. </em>2006).</p>  <p>Using predictive modelling across Central Asia, Barashkova <em>et al.</em> (2019) estimated that suitable Pallas’s Cat habitats cover 170 protected areas of Russia, Mongolia, Kazakhstan, and Kyrgyzstan; although confirmation of the species has only been documented in 36 of the protected areas. In Russia, the Tyvan and Daurian State Nature Reserves remain the most important protected areas for Pallas’s Cat conservation, the recently created federal refuge in Dzeren's Valley (subordinated to Daursky reserve) is also occupied by Pallas’s Cat's ( Barashkova <em>et al.</em> 2019). Although research is ongoing in Western Asia and the Himalaya, conservation actions are currently limited (<span class=""A8"">Moqanaki<em> et al. </em>2019, Dhendup <em>et al</em>. 2019). A preliminary assessment of the potential distribution of the Pallas’s Cat in Western Asia predicted vast climatic suitability across mid-elevation areas in this region, yet dispersal barriers and biotic interactions (e.g. predator-prey relationships) may have restricted the currently occupied habitat (Moqanaki <em>et al.</em> 2019). The same is true of China, but Pallas’s Cat has been reported in several protected areas including: Xuelingyunshan, Tuomuerfeng, Luoshan, Baijitan, Qinghaihuniaodao, Wanglang, Wolong, Zhumulangmafeng, Kalamailishan, Qitaihuangmobanhuangmo, Aerjinshan, Ganjiahu (Xinjiang), Luobupoyeluotuo (CSIS 2008). It is reportedly present in at least 29 Chinese Nature Reserves (Mallon 2002, Smith <em>et al.</em> 2008, Jutzeler <em>et al</em><em>. </em>2010, <span class=""A8"">Dhendup<em> et al. </em>2019).</span></p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p>Required Conservation Actions</p>  <p></p><ol><li>Implimentation of conservation action plan (Pallas's Cat Global Action Planning Group 2019).</li><li>Confirm occupancy in protected areas within the species EOO, and extend to confirm occupancy in suitable habitats predicted using distribution models. </li><li>Establish a suitable and quantifiable monitoring method for the species.</li><li>Identify and implement population monitoring in key areas that have potential to indicate the species status at a wider scale. </li><li>Identify regions where human caused threats endanger Pallas’s Cat and implement mitigation measures.&#160; </li><li>Recommend new protected areas in Pallas’s Cat hotspots not currently protected. </li><li>Increase collaboration between Pallas’s Cat researchers to validate and refine population distribution and habitat distribution models.&#160; </li><li>Understand the species population dynamics in relation to potential prey population cycles in areas where we know large population fluctuations occur (such as the Daurian steppe).

In the Chaco, <em>Aotus a. azarae</em> occurs in dry, semi deciduous forest patches and gallery forest, where annual rainfall can be as low as 500 m a year (Wright 1985; Stallings <em>et al.</em> 1989; Brooks 1996; Fernández-Duque <em>et al.</em> 2002). <em>Aotus a. boliviensis</em> is found in semi-deciduous and evergreen lowland forests in Bolivia and up to at least 1,250 m above sea level in some parts of the Andes. <em>Aotus a. infulatus</em> inhabits lowland evergreen forests in southern Pará and northern Mato Grosso, but forest patches and gallery forest in the Cerrado (bush savanna) of the Pantanal in Mato Grosso. Aquino and Encarnación (1994) reviewed the habitat and forest preferences of the genus.</p> <p>Night monkeys are nocturnal, being most active at dawn and dusk. The only exception is <em>Aotus azarae azarae</em> of the Chaco in southern Bolivia, Paraguay and Argentina, which is cathemeral (irregularly active at any time of night or day). They are frugivorous, but their diet includes also nectar, flowers (seasonally important for <em>A. a. azarae</em> in the Chaco), and small animal prey such as insects (Wright 1989; Fernández-Duque 2007). <em>Aotus azarae</em> has been observed to include a significant portion of leaves in its diet (Ganzhorn and Wright 1994; Wright 1985; Arditi and Placci 1990; Giménez and Fernández-Duque 2003).</p> <p>They are socially monogamous and form family groups of 2 to 5 individuals, comprising of an adult pair and 1 to 4 offspring of different age (infant, juveniles and sometimes a subadult). However, a significant number of adults are solitary. These may be subadults that left their natal groups or older adults which were evicted from their groups by competitors (Fernández-Duque and Huntington 2002; Fernández-Duque 2004). Normally, the male cares for the infants, but the females occasionally provide alimentation and care for the litter during the first week after the birth (Wright 1984; Dixson 1994).</p> <p>In the wild, male <em>A. azarae</em> reach adult weight when about 4 years old, and age at first reproduction is about 5 years (Juárez <em>et al.</em> 2003; Fernández-Duque 2004). Single offspring are the rule and the birth interval is 8 to 10 months (Wright 1985).</p> <p>Night monkeys are territorial—groups occupy overlapping territories of 5-18 ha (depending on species and location) (Wright 1978; Fernández-Duque 2007). Wright (1989) points out that home ranges of <em>Aotus azarae azarae</em> could be bigger than those of <em>A. azarae boliviensis</em>. For instance, Wright (1989) gives 5 ha for Paraguay, but Schwindt <em>et al.</em> (2004) and (Arditi 1992) reported 4 to 10 ha in Argentina and 12 ha at Guaycolec, Formosa Province in Argentina, respectively.</p> <p> The intrinsic morphological similarities among species of the genus <em>Aotus</em> and the slight variation in their phenotypes make the identification of various subspecies difficult. However, differences in body coloration, geographic distribution and phylogenetic analysis need to be considered to finally establish the taxon’s’ taxonomic status and to obtain more information on its ecology and conservation status.</p>","<p> Threats to this species in the Brazilian Cerrado, in the Bolivian Chaco-Chiquitano forest, and the Paraguayan Chaco include habitat loss due to agricultural development for soy beans and cattle ranching. In Argentina it also includes small-scale farming and cattle ranching, and in Bolivia urban development around Santa Cruz de la Sierra. Minimal subsistence hunting occurs in Bolivia, for consumption and as bait for fishing. In Brazil, the main threats identified for the taxon were fire, agriculture, livestock keeping, urban expansion, deforestation, habitat disconnection, habitat reduction and mineral extraction. These are general threats for the taxon across its geographic range and there is no specific information available about the intensity of these threats affecting single populations (Rímoli and Rylands 2015).</p>","<p> Population density estimates for this species vary across different studies. Estimates are mainly available from Argentina, Paraguay and Bolivia. Across its range, the species is relatively common, but due to its nocturnal and crepuscular behavior it is usually ignored in primate abundance surveys. Only a few reliable estimates of population density are available for any of the subspecies. Aquino and Encarnación (1994) reviewed population structure and densities for the genus.  </p> <p> In the eastern Formosa Province (Guaycolec) in Argentina, densities in gallery forests can be as high as 60 individuals/km² (Fernández-Duque <em>et al.</em> 2001). Elsewhere in the Formosa Province, relatively lower densities were established: 32.3 individuals/km² (Zunino <em>et al.</em> 1986), 25.0 individuals/km²&#160;(Arditi and Placci 1990), 64.0 individuals/km²&#160;in gallery forests (Fernández-Duque <em>et al.</em> 2001), 12.8-29 individuals/km²&#160;(Fernández-Duque <em>et al.</em> 2007), 15.0 individuals/km²&#160;(Brown and Zunino 1994), and 29.0 individuals/km²&#160;(Rathbun and Gache 1980).</p> <p>In Teniente Enciso in Paraguay, Stallings <em>et al.</em> (1989) estimated population density as 8.9 individuals/km², while for Agua Dulce, Stallings <em>et al.</em> (1989) reported 14.4 individuals/km².</p> <p>In Bolivia, Ayala (2011) reported 15.3-26.6 individuals/km² along the Rio Parapeti in the Bañados de Izozog depression (Ayala 2011). From the Bosque Chimanes, in Beni, 13-18 individuals/km²&#160;were reported (Rumiz and Herrera 2000) and Wallace <em>et al</em>.

In Brazil it is present in the Pantanal of the states of states of Mato Grosso and Mato Grosso do Sul, where it is resident and native (Cáceres <em>et al.</em> 2008; Fernández-Duque <em>et al.</em> 2008; Melo and Damasceno Jr. 1998; Melo and Amorim 2003; Melo and Antunes 2004; Melo <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 2004; Melo and Martins Vincensi 2004; Tomas and Mourão 2007; Tomas <em>et al.</em> 2010, 2011).  </p> <p>In Paraguay, Azara’s night monkeys are found in the dry southern and western parts of the Chaco (excluding the extreme West where no Primates occur) and west of the Paraguay River (Fernández-Duque <em>et al.</em> 2008). Its presence extends further to the South-west of the Rio Paraguay and across the Rio Pilcomayo in Bolivia and Argentina, and to the South of the Rio Bermejo and Rio Negro in the Argentinian provinces of Formosa and Chaco (Rathbun and Gache 1980, Hershkovitz 1983, Stallings 1985, 1989; Zunino <em>et al.</em> 1986; Stallings <em>et al.</em> 1989). In the West, its distribution extends along the Cordillera Oriental, but the limit to the North is not clearly defined (Fernández-Duque <em>et al.</em> 2008). According to Hershkovitz (1983), the species can occur in Bolivia’s Bañados de Izozog.</p> <p>Presumably, the current distribution is reduced relative to its historical extent. It is suspected that Azara’s night monkeys also occurred in southwestern Mato Grosso, in northwestern Mato Grosso do Sul (Corumbá and Ladário Municipalities) and along the border between Brazil and Bolivia (Tomas &amp; Mourão 2007, Tomas <em>et al.</em> 2010, 2011 ).</p>",Common in local pet trade,Terrestrial,"<p> This species is listed in the appendix II of CITES.

205540097,22720912,Emberiza cineracea,Near Threatened,C1,2021,2021-08-17 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,This poorly known migratory species is classified as Near Threatened because its moderately small population is suspected to be declining as a result of the conversion and degradation of its habitats; it almost meets the requirements for listing as threatened under criterion C1. Improved information on its population size and trend may in due course lead to a reassessment of its status.,"The species breeds on dry rocky slopes and uplands with shrubby vegetation and sometimes conifers. It may also use areas with isolated trees, such as Pinus brutia, or taller bushes. It is migratory, wintering in dry open country with short grass, semi-desert, low rocky hills, bare cultivated land and dry scrub, often in coastal areas. On passage, it occurs on stony and rocky slopes/hillsides with low annual grasses and bushes, chiefly in desert uplands, with a few cultivated patches (Shirihai, 1996). Migrating birds are regularly recorded in lowland agricultural land and semi-deserts.<br/>In Turkey the breeding habitat ranges from c. 100–1800 m at least, thought to extend to sea level (Roselaar, 1995). The habitat is reported to extend to sea level in the Greek islands.","Changes in grazing pressure by sheep and goats could affect the population size. High grazing pressure could result in the trampling of nests, whereas too little grazing could reduce the area of open feeding sites<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(Albayrak <em>et al</em>. 2003). Remaining habitat in western Turkey is being developed rapidly for tourism<strong></strong> (Tucker and Heath 1994). Suitable habitats in south-east Turkey have been flooded by dam construction, resulting both in direct habitat loss and the relocation of displaced villagers to new, currently unpopulated areas (Albayrak <em>et al</em>. 2003). Construction of wind farms and mining in the species's habitats in Turkey are further threats (S. Isfendiyaroglu <em>in litt</em>. 2015). This species is caught and killed in trammel and mist nests along the Egyptian coast (although it is not the primary target) (Eason <em>et al., </em>2016).&#160;<p></p>","The European population is suspected to be 5,300-10,400 mature individuals (Birdlife International (in prep)), of which 96% is found in Turkey (Yavuz&#160;<em>et al.,&#160;</em>2018). In 2015, there were thought to be less than 100 pairs in Iran and a minimum of 1,000 pairs in Iraq (R. Porter&#160;<em>in litt</em>. 2015).&#160;The global population is suspected to number 7,000-12,600 mature individuals, roughly equating to 10,600-18,900 individuals in total, here placed in the band 10,000-19,999 individuals.",Decreasing,"This species&#160;breeds on the islands of Skyros<strong></strong> (Hölzinger 1995), Lesbos and Chios, <strong>Greece</strong> (105-205 pairs<strong></strong> [BirdLife International 2015]), and western <strong>Turkey</strong> (race <em>cineracea</em>), as well as in south-east Turkey (where it can be abundant in some specific habitats [A. Staneva <em>in litt. </em>2016]), south-west <strong>Iran</strong> (fewer than 100 pairs in the Zagros mountains; race <em>semenowi</em>) (Cramp and Perrins 1994,&#160;Byers&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;1995, Kirwan <em>et al. </em>2008) and <strong>Iraq</strong> (minimum 1,000 pairs in Iraqi Kurdistan [R. Porter <em>in litt</em>. 2015]) (Porter and Aspinall 2010). Statements regarding potential breeding in northern Syria are of uncertain validity<strong> </strong>(Albayrak <em>et al</em>. 2003). The winter distribution remains poorly known, but includes <strong>Eritrea</strong> and <strong>Yemen,</strong> and potentially also Ethiopia (Bantihun <em>et al., </em>2020), north-east Sudan and south-west Saudi Arabia (where records may solely relate to individuals on migration) (Walther <em>et al</em>. 2004, Walther 2006). In addition, there are passage records along the species's two, well-separated migration routes: Cyprus, Syria, Lebanon, Israel, Jordan, Palestinian Authority Territories and Egypt (predominantly race <em>cineracea</em>); and Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain, United Arab Emirates and Oman (race <em>semenowi</em>). The Turkish breeding population - which at 3,100-5,500 pairs constitutes the great majority of the global population - was suspected to have declined by 0-19% during 1990-2000 (BirdLife International 2004) and in 1990-2013 (BirdLife International 2015).<p></p>",,Terrestrial,<strong>Conservation and Research Actions Underway</strong><br/>The species is legally protected under Greek and Turkish law<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(Albayrak <em>et al</em>. 2003). One of the breeding sites on Lesbos is partially protected as a Natural Monument and Wildlife Refuge<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(Albayrak <em>et al</em>. 2003). An international action plan was published in 2003<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(Albayrak <em>et al</em>. 2003). The species's potential winter distribution has been modelled using GIS-based techniques<strong></strong> (Walther <em>et al</em>. 2004). Surveys undertaken by Nature Iraq from 2005 to 2012 have revealed that Iraqi Kurdistan is an important area for the species with 23 of 53 potential Key Biodiversity Areas surveyed containing breeding individuals (R.

McKenzie pers. comm. 2016). At other times of the year the species may be difficult to encounter in these areas.
