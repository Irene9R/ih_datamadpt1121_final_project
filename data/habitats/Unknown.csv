As currently accepted, this species is restricted to eastern Australia and New Zealand. However, if&#160;<em>L. gloveri</em> is accepted into the synonymy of <em>L. cheesemanii</em>&#160;the geographic range and threats to this species will be substantially increased. <em>Lagocephalus cheesemanii </em>is likely distributed from the Andaman sea east to Indonesia, north to southern Japan, including the Yellow and Bohai seas, and can be found at depths ranging from zero to 100 metres. It may be common in parts of its range. Adults inhabit the continental shelf over sandy or muddy bottoms, and juveniles can be found in estuaries. This species is likely a&#160;popular food fish in China, Taiwan and Japan. There is little species-specific population information available. This species is non-toxic and safe for consumption as processed and fresh fish product. It appears to be landed in large quantities in parts of its range, but does not appear to be particularly valuable. Based on population trends seen in other species of commercially important pufferfishes it is inferred that this species may be undergoing population declines in parts of its range. It is also likely to be impacted by coastal habitat degradation, particularly near estuaries and river mouths. Suspected population declines from exploitation and habitat degradation are not currently quantifiable due to lack of reliable data.

In Japan, Pufferfish landings have declined since the early 1990s. Concern about the fishery centers on the most valuable and preferred species,&#160;<em>Takifugu rubripes</em>,&#160;which, as of 2010, was considered depleted in Japan.<em>&#160;</em>Landings of&#160;<em>T. rubripes</em>&#160;in Japan had declined to 5% of annual landings in 1987. Landings of ""other pufferfish"", a category which includes&#160;<em>L. cheeesemanii</em> (as<em> L. gloveri</em>)<em>&#160;</em>were maximized after the decline in&#160;<em>T. rubripes&#160;</em>landings. These ""other pufferfish"" have declined from a peak of roughly 400 tonnes in 1999 to less than 100 tonnes in 2007, a decline of roughly 75%. Declines in landings have been attributed to the effects of highly-effective long-line fishing (Kawata 2012).<br/><br/>Fishery-dependent data from China showed declines in catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) of L. <em>cheesemanii&#160;</em>(as<em>&#160;L. gloveri</em>)&#160;from 2001 to 2003, however this data may represent several species of this genus.

Heavy metals have also been implicated in the degradation of the heavily populated and industrialized Pearl River delta region in southern China (Cheung&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2003). In the Gulf of Thailand, coastal habitat degradation has resulted from pollution, primarily from untreated municipal and industrial waste water, as well as a rapid decrease in mangrove forests, coral reefs, and fisheries resources (Cheevaporn and Menasveta 2003).","<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Lagacephalus cheesemanii</span>&#160;is common and can be locally abundant (K.

However, it is known to have survived until almost immediately prior to European arrival in the Caribbean, suggesting strongly that pre-Columbian human impacts did not cause its disappearance and that it persisted into the historical period. Several reports of rats being eaten on Nevis and St. Kitts, in one instance of animals specifically described as “unusual-looking” (i.e. suggesting a difference from introduced black rats), have been reported from the seventeenth, eighteenth, and twentieth centuries, until the 1930s, and may well represent this species. However, several weeks of survey work in 2009 (involving live trapping with Sherman and Tomahawk traps) at various elevations in the forests of Nevis Peak found no evidence of the Nevis Rice Rat’s continued survival, and instead discovered very high densities of invasive mongoose and black rats throughout the island’s forests (Turvey unpublished data). The species is therefore assessed as Extinct.","Nothing is known about this species’ habitat or ecology. This island rice rat was about the same size as a black rat, and therefore much smaller than <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Megalomys</span>, the other recently extinct endemic insular Caribbean rice rat genus.","The cause of extinction of the Nevis Rice Rat is unknown.

It has been recorded from numerous pre-Columbian zooarchaeological sites, as it constituted a major component of the diet of prehistoric Amerindians.","This species was widely exploited by Amerindians for food during the recent prehistoric period, but its continued presence in kitchen middens dating closely before European arrival in the Caribbean c.500 years ago suggests that this exploitation did not seriously impact its population. Animals specifically identified as rats, and therefore possibly representing this species, were described as providing “good meat” on St. Kitts (Harlow 1925), and in 1720 it was reported that “in Nevis some people do eat Rats, wrapping them up in banano-leaves to bake them as it were under warm embers” (Merrill 1958).

The current population density is not known, and the species has declined since the 1970s but has been confirmed to still occur in Lake Victoria in low numbers.

Locally known as the “tretretretre”, the animal was said to have a short, round head, human-like face and ears, monkey-like hands and feet with elongated digits, frizzy hair, and a short tail.

45156279,2814,Bison bonasus,Near Threatened,C2a(i),2020,2020-07-28 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<p>This Red List Assessment (RLA) is for the species and does not include analyses of subspecies or genetic lines. According to the Red List Guidelines (IUCN 2019), this assessment focuses primarily on free-living (wild) subpopulations that are larger than Minimum Viable Population (MVP) size (150 mature animals), and finds a genuine increasing change in the past five years and since the most recent Red List assessment (Olech 2008); so that the species no longer qualifies for threatened status (Critically Endangered, Endangered, or Vulnerable) under Red List Criteria A-E per below (IUCN 2019). In 2019, there were only eight subpopulations greater than MVP that included 2,518 mature animals, with no subpopulation including greater than 500 mature animals; thus making this species nearly qualify for Vulnerable C2a(i). Additional consideration of free-living subpopulations that are less  than MVP, indicates that this species warrants Near Threatened status in  light of its dependence on ongoing conservation programmes to persist  beyond the next five years, a very limited number of viable free-living  subpopulations (eight), and a large number of small isolated  free-living subpopulations less than MVP (39). While the number of  conservation herds and individuals in subpopulations managed for  species conservation and ecological restoration is increasing, all  free-living mature individuals occur within active management programmes  which, if ceased, would result in the species qualifying for a threatened  status. The species is not currently in decline but the overall free-living population size of wild mature individuals could decline or suffer extreme fluctuation if current protections are reduced or removed. This is a conservation dependent species and several exacerbating factors described below are anticipated to continue across the current and next generation unless there are substantial multi-national adjustments in management of free-living European Bison.&#160; </p>    <p></p><ol><li><u><strong>Population viability</strong>.</u> There are very few viable subpopulations (only eight out of 47 free-living subpopulations are greater than MVP). Most free-living bison subpopulations are very small (e.g. ~34% <u>&lt;</u> 25 mature animals, ~51% <u>&lt;</u>50 mature individuals, and ~83% include less than MVP of 150 mature animals), indicating that natural selection dynamics are not operating adequately. Quantitative population viability analyses of the eight free-living populations greater than MVP have not been completed.</li><li><u><strong>Genetics</strong>.</u> Mean expected heterozygosity, calculated on the basis of microsatellite data, has been estimated as 0.29 (29%) for the Lowland line and 0.35 (35%) for the Lowland-Caucasian line (Tokarska unpublished). This low genetic variability negatively influences effective population size (N<sub>e</sub>). For example, the largest subpopulation is the Polish part of the Białowieża Forest (462 mature animals), yet the effective population size is calculated as less than 30 (Tokarska <em>et al. </em>2009). Based on the extremely limited number of founder animals, this tremendous disparity between subpopulation number of mature animals and N<sub>e</sub> can be reliably inferred for other free-ranging subpopulations.</li><li><u><strong>Fragmentation</strong>.</u>&#160;Approximately 77% of 43 free living subpopulations for which information is available are functionally isolated by distance or an impermeable barrier. Approximately 30% of free-living subpopulations are isolated by an impermeable barrier (man-made or natural) from the nearest neighbour subpopulation. For subpopulations not isolated by a natural or man-made barrier, 60% are at least 60 km from the nearest-neighbour subpopulation (range 60–530 km). It can be expected that subpopulations at a greater distance from a nearest neighbour are much less likely to see successful natural dispersal or exchange of cows (and their genetics) between subpopulations across multiple generations, thus we can infer further genetic drift of inherently low genetic diversity to be amplified through long-term isolation.</li><li><u><strong>Supplemental feeding and selective culling</strong>.</u> The majority of free-living European Bison subpopulations were restored into forest habitats, which often do not provide sufficient food resources year round for this large herbivore. Supplemental feeding occurs at all eight subpopulations greater than MVP, and is reported for 34 out 46 free living subpopulations for which information is available. Selective culling is reported for six out of eight subpopulations greater than MVP. While supplemental feeding and selective culling are well-intentioned to manage subpopulation distribution and abundance to protect bison from poaching and to reduce conflicts with surrounding land uses, there is concern that long-term reliance on these management techniques could lead to unintended consequences, including unsustainable expense, reduced subpopulation viability, and disruption of the species evolved natural life history.</li><li><u><strong>Conservation dependence</strong>.</u> Free-living European Bison are a conservation dependent species. Though the total mature population size for the eight subpopulations greater than MVP has been increasing for the past generation, there have also been recent incidents of local extinction of other subpopulations (see WWF 2019). While the species is not currently in decline, the abundance of wild mature individuals could be reduced if there are significant perturbations such as a major disease outbreak, or current management regimes are negatively changed or removed. Such major perturbations have occurred previously leading to the species changing from Vulnerable to Endangered status in Red List Assessments conducted in 1996 and 2000. Progress in recovery of the European Bison through large-scale ecological restoration projects will depend on significant changes in its legal status and management as wildlife by governments, harmonisation of policies and activities among agencies at multiple levels, cooperation with environmental organisations, and public tolerance and support of free-living bison managed as wildlife on large landscapes. Cooperation and coordination are particularly important where different nations and organisations have separate management jurisdiction for adjacent land areas within an ecosystem unit in which ecological restoration of bison is possible.</li></ol><u><br/><strong>Red List Criterion A</strong></u><strong> </strong>– Population Size Reduction.&#160;Not applicable.&#160;Over three generations (36 years, 1983–2019), the number of free-living mature animals in subpopulations greater than MVP has increased from several hundred to over 2,500.<br/><br/><strong><u>Red List Criterion B</u> </strong>– Geographic Range.&#160;Not applicable.&#160;The minimum-maximum AOO of the eight subpopulations &gt;MVP is 13,236-22,100 km², and exceeds the Criteria B threshold of 2,000 km².

Quantitative population viability analyses of the eight free-living subpopulations greater than MVP have not been completed.","<p>The majority of European Bison subpopulations were (re)introduced to forest habitats (Kerley <em>et al.</em> 2012). However, patterns of habitat use strongly vary between different population and are strongly shaped by habitat structure (forest cover) and management actions (Hofman-Kamińska <em>et al.</em> 2018). Preference towards open habitats such as meadows, river valleys, abandoned farmland, forest gaps and clearing is observed (Kuemmerle <em>et al.</em> 2011, Kowalczyk <em>et al.</em> 2019, Zielke <em>et al</em>. 2019). European Bison are mixed feeders or browsers (Gębczyńska <em>et al.</em> 1991; Kowalczyk <em>et al.</em> 2011, 2019; Bocherens <em>et al.</em> 2015, Merceron <em>et al.</em> 2015), which continuously adjust their diet with seasonal availability of easily digestible non-grass vegetation (Kowalczyk <em>et al.</em> 2019). In winter, bison foraging ecology can be strongly influenced by supplementary feeding (Kowalczyk <em>et al.</em> 2011). Non-fed populations usually utilise open habitats and agriculture areas. Farm crops depredation is compensated in some countries. European bison are not territorial and their spatial organisation and population density are influenced by habitat quality and food abundance (Kerley <em>et al.</em> 2020). Home ranges of bison covers from several dozen to two hundred km<sup>2</sup>, in relation to habitat structure and seasonal migrations (Kowalczyk and Plumb 2020). Home range sizes of mixed groups are influenced by the distribution and availability of forage resources, while home range of mature males is more related to reproductive behaviour and activity than food-related factors. In many populations seasonal migrations are observed, driven by supplementary feeding or access to food resources out of forest habitats, or having altitudinal character to avoid harsh winter conditions (Kowalczyk <em>et al.</em> 2013, Perzanowski <em>et al. </em>2012).&#160; Dispersal by male bison has occured up to several hundred km (Krasińska and Krasiński 2013). Dispersal by mixed groups is beginning to be observed in expanding populations, as the result of density-dependent intra-specific competition (Kowalczyk <em>et al.</em> 2013, Krasińska <em>et al.</em> 2014).&#160; The European Bison exhibits a well-developed and dynamic social organisation (Krasińska <em>et al.</em> 2014). Mixed groups of up to 20 individuals generally, including adult cows, 2–3-year-old sub-adults and calves are the basic social units. Males remain solitary or form bachelor groups of two to eight animals. The size and composition of mixed groups are dynamic and change seasonally, being the largest during rut and winter aggregations (Krasińska and Krasiński 2013). Daily activity is typical of large ruminants and includes foraging bouts (up to five hours) alternating with resting bouts (up to four hours) devoted primarily to rumination (Caboń-Raczyńska <em>et al.</em> 1987).&#160; <br/></p>","<p><u><strong>Genetics</strong><br/></u>Contemporary genetic variability of European Bison is relatively low, being an effect of population bottleneck due to species extirpation in the wild in the early 20<sup>th</sup> century and subsequent restoration from limited number of captive survivors. The entire contemporary species population derives from only 12 individual genotypes (Pucek <em>et al.</em> 2004, Wójcik <em>et al.</em> 2009, Tokarska <em>et al.</em> 2011). Mean expected heterozygosity, calculated on the basis of microsatellite data, has been estimated as 0.29 (29%) for the Lowland line and 0.35 (35%) for the Lowland-Caucasian line (Tokarska, unpublished). This low genetic variability negatively influences effective population size (N<sub>e</sub>). For example, the largest subpopulation is the Polish part of the Białowieża Forest (462 mature animals), yet the effective population size is likely less than 30 (Tokarska <em>et al. </em>2009). Based on the extremely limited number of founder animals, this tremendous disparity between subpopulation number of mature animals and N<sub>e</sub> can be reliably inferred for other free-ranging subpopulations.<br/><br/><u><strong>Fragmentation and small population size</strong><br/></u>Approximately 77% of free-living subpopulations for which information is available are functionally isolated and fragmented from nearest neighbour populations by distance or barriers (man-made or natural). There are only eight subpopulations that exceed MVP, and ~34% of all free-living subpopulations include 25 or fewer mature animals, ~51% include 50 or fewer mature individuals, and ~83% of the populations include less than MVP. Given the small size of most free-living subpopulations, those at a greater distance from a nearest neighbour are much less likely to see successful natural dispersal or exchange of cows (and their genetics) between subpopulations across multiple generations, and thus we can infer further genetic drift of inherently low genetic diversity to be amplified through long-term isolation.<br/><br/><u><strong>Refugee Species</strong><br/></u>When restoration into the wild began in 1952, the European Bison was characterised as a forest specialist and thus the species was restored in forest habitats. Increasing scientific evidence demonstrates that the European Bison is also adapted to effective use of open and mixed habitats (Mendoza and Palmqvist 2008, Kerley <em>et al. 2012</em>, Bocherens <em>et al.</em> 2015, Hofman-Kamińska <em>et al. </em>2019). Recently, the species has been recharacterized as a refugee species, that can no longer access optimal habitat, but is confined to sub-optimal habitats, with consequences of decreased fitness and density, and attendant conservation risks (Kerley <em>et al.</em> 2012). The process of becoming a refugee species likely started after the last glaciation due to increasing human pressure related to human spread and development of Neolithic agriculture, and was reinforced during species restoration (Kerley <em>et al.</em> 2012, Hofman-Kamińska 2019). Confinement of an open-habitat adapted species to forest habitats may act against natural selection pressures, entails supplementary feeding, intensifies management complexity, increases management expense, increases vulnerability to disease and parasites, and may increase risks of human-wildlife conflicts when bison attempt to move out of forests (Hofman-Kamińska and Kowalczyk 2012; Kerley <em>et al.</em> 2012; Kowalczyk <em>et al.</em> 2013; Kołodziej-Sobocińska <em>et al.</em> 2016a, b, c; Samojlik <em>et al.</em> 2019). Contemporary habitat selection indicates the species’ preference for open and wet/open habitats and abandoned fields over the forests, especially coniferous ones (Kuemmerle <em>et al.</em> 2010, 2018, Kowalczyk <em>et al.</em> 2019, Zielke <em>et al.</em> 2019). As a large and potentially conflicting species, European Bison require large spaces of mosaic habitats supporting the populations year round, with lower human densities and agricultural activities, to reduce potential conflicts. Such areas are limited in Europe. Increasing land abandonment in Eastern Europe (Russia and Ukraine) creates potentially suitable conditions for species restoration (Alcantra <em>et al. </em>2013), however instability of nature conservation in those countries makes these areas risky. Forest introductions are still continuing (e.g. Bad Berleburg, Germany and Augustów Forest, NE Poland), though recent reintroduction in Romania and Bulgaria in suitable remote mountainous areas may lead to subpopulation growth with less conflict.<br/><br/><u><strong>Disease</strong><br/></u>Knowledge on health status of European Bison comes from limited number of populations, mainly in Poland. While several diseases are known to occur in European Bison, including blue tongue virus, foot-and-mouth disease, respiratory viruses, and bovine tuberculosis (Larska and Krzysiak 2019), they are not as broadly distributed within or across free-ranging populations as the infectious parasites. Nearly 90 species of parasites in European Bison were identified (Karbowiak <em>et al.</em> 2014a, b), with species richness, prevalence and intensity of infections increasing in multiple populations (Drożdż 1998). It was documented that supplementary feeding and unnatural aggregation of bison in winter at fixed locations lead to increased parasitic load (Radwan <em>et al. </em>2010, Kerley <em>et al.</em> 2012, Karbowiak <em>et al.</em> 2014b, Kołodziej-Sobocińska <em>et al.</em> 2016b). Adaptive management has proven effective in reducing parasite transmission and risk of diseases (Kołodziej-Sobocińska <em>et al.</em> 2016b).<br/><br/><u><strong>Culling, hunting, poaching</strong><br/></u>Paradoxically for a species with low numbers, some free-living subpopulations (including small ones) are subjected to culling to reduce number, regulate sex-age structure or even for commercial hunting purposes. This policy contrasts strongly with the management of other large mammals which have undergone similar population declines as the European Bison and for which populations are now increasing in response to conservation management, such as the rhinoceros or the Cape Mountain Zebra (Emslie 2008, IUCN SSC African Rhino Specialist Group 2008, Hrabar and Kerley 2013). Poaching plays locally important role especially in small populations exposed to high stochasticity. In the 1990s, uncontrolled hunting and poaching in Ukraine during democratic transformation resulted in a strong decline or extirpation of bison herds (WWF 2019).<br/><br/><u><strong>Policy inconsistency</strong><br/></u>Though this issue was identified in the 2004 <em>European Bison Status Survey and Conservation Action Plan</em> (Pucek <em>et al. </em>2004), it still remains an important concern. The European Bison is generally a protected species in the countries where it occurs. It is covered by EU legislation in frame of Council Directive 92/43/EEC on the conservation of natural habitats and of wild fauna and flora, and included in the Annex 2 (animal and plant species of community interest whose conservation requires the designation of special areas of conservation) as priority species, and Annex 4 (animal and plant species of community interest in need of strict protection). However, across the historic range, there are inconsistent national policies regarding management and conservation procedures, that can concede to habitat degradation, population restriction, and selective culling. Following political transformations in Eastern Europe, uncontrolled hunting and poaching in Russia and Ukraine lead to population decline (Pucek <em>et al</em>. 2004, WWF 2019). Such inconsistency not only impacts existing populations, but also limits the possibility of restoration and population expansion. Large areas of abandoned fields in eastern Europe in recent decades (especially in Russia and Ukraine) (Alcantara <em>et al.</em> 2013) may now be suitable for the introduction of the bison, but cannot currently be considered due to insufficient protection.</p>","<p>This assessment adheres to the IUCN Red List Guidelines and utilises IUCN terminology intended for consistency across taxa (IUCN 2019). For this assessment, ‘subpopulation’ does not infer a meta-population. The Red List term ‘wild’ equates to the ‘free-living’ animals as reported in the EBPB, and does not include the EBPB “captivity” or “semi-free living (e.g. large enclosures)” categories. This assessment also refers to the term ‘minimum viable population (MVP)' as an <strong></strong>ecological threshold <span lang=""IT"">that specifies the smallest number of individuals in a subpopulation capable of persisting at a specific statistical probability level for a predetermined amount of time. This Red List assessment (RLA) uses the occupied grid cell approach to estimate ‘area of occupancy (AOO)’; by counting the number of occupied cells in a uniform grid that covers the entire range of distribution, and then tallying the total area (km²) of all occupied cells; so that AOO = number of occupied cells × area of an individual cell (IUCN 2019). Though the Red List Guidelines recommend using a uniform 2 x 2 km grid for consistency across taxon, we also used a comparative 10 x 10 km grid that better aligns to the spatial scale of the landscape ecology of the European Bison (see Kowalczyk <em>et al. </em>2013, Kuemmerle <em>et al.</em> 2018, J.A. Hernandez-Blanco pers. comm. 2020, G. Wilson pers. comm. 2020), in order to generate comparative minimum and maximum AOO estimates. <span lang=""EN-GB"">The term ‘extent of occurrence (EOO)’ is the calculated minimum convex polygon area size (km²) for a set of subpopulations (IUCN 2019).<br/><br/>In addition to information from the European Bison Pedigree Book, this assessment also considers subpopulation-specific information to assess whether a subpopulation is deemed to contribute to the number of mature individuals considered in a Red List Assessment. A key consideration is whether a free-living subpopulation includes sufficient mature animals to maintain the potential for ecological adaption through the effects of natural selection operating on viable populations. While there is variation in age-class demography between subpopulations, this information is not uniformly monitored or reported to EBPB. As reported in the detailed species monograph by Krasińska and Krasiński (2013), the mature age class generally accounts for approximately 60% of a subpopulation. Thus, for this assessment, the 60% mature age class was applied uniformly to each subpopulation. Taking into account the levels of inbreeding of the European Bison population (described below), Brook <em>et&#160;al.</em> (2002)<span class=""MsoHyperlink""> calculated the MVP of a subpopulation as 250 individuals for a 95% probability of subpopulation survival for 100 years; thus yielding a generalized MVP of 150 mature animals (250 * 0.60). Subpopulation size trend (increasing, decreasing, stable) was assessed between 2015–2019 (as reported in the 2016 and 2020 EBPB). The Red List Guidelines prescribe analyses to be conducted for the recent 10 years, or three generations, whichever is longer (IUCN 2019). For this assessment, generation length is calculated as 1/adult mortality + age of first reproduction (IUCN 2019), wherein the age of first reproduction is set at 4 years and adult mortality set at 13% (Krasińska and Krasiński 2013), so that generation length = 4+ 1/.13 = 11.7 rounded up to 12 years. Thus, for the analyses herein, three generations equal 36 years. Fragmentation is considered through measurements of distance (km) to nearest neighbour subpopulation and whether there are natural or man-made barriers to dispersal movement between subpopulations. Additional consideration is given to whether subpopulation resources are naturally limited or if the subpopulation otherwise receives supplemental feeding; and whether a subpopulation is subject to selective culling. Belarus has indicated that, while the&#160;Nacional’nyjj Park Pripjatskijj is reported to the EBPB as one subpopulation, there are actually two free living herds that are isolated from each other (P.

Lowland Bison were distributed across western and eastern Europe (Węcek <em>et al.</em> 2016, Pucek <em>et al.</em> 2004), while the Caucasian Bison occurred only in the northern Caucasus mountains and foothills (Heptner <em>et al.</em> 1966). As a generalist quadruped, the European Bison evolved to utilise open or mixed habitats; and with relatively high mobility in response to environmental drivers, there was likely substantial variation in local abundance and density, including extended absences at local to regional scales while the species was still distributed across the historic range. In short, the European Bison was likely patchily distributed and did not occur everywhere all the time within suitable habitat within its historic range. Extensive forest expansion occurred 12,000–8,000 Before Present (BP) concomitant with reduced open habitats available for large herbivores such as Bison and Aurochs. Humans expanded with the development of Neolithic agriculture (7,000-5,000 years BP) resulting in pressures on bison including hunting and land use conversion to agriculture. The species became absent from most of Europe between 9,500 and 7,000 years BP,&#160; and after this period, recovered or recolonised, probably from east (see Hofman-Kamińska <em>et al.</em> 2019). Since the 16<sup>th</sup> century, European Bison persisted in the wild only through royal protection. By the 19<sup>th</sup> century, free-living European Bison were limited to only the Białowieża Forest of northeast Poland and western Belarus, and Caucasus mountains (Pucek <em>et a</em>l. 2004). By the early 20<sup>th</sup> century, the species was increasingly imperilled in the wild, with the Lowland Bison becoming Extinct in the Wild in 1919, and the Caucasian Bison Extinct in the Wild by 1927 (Pucek <em>et al. </em>2004).<br/>&#160; <br/></p><strong></strong>","In general, free-living European bison are not subject to extensive trade and use. All free-living subpopulations exist at locations where management emphasis is primarily on protection of the species; with some locations utilizing supplemental feeding and selective culling to manage local distribution and abundance in order to mitigate potential poaching and conflicts with surrounding land uses.",Terrestrial,"<p><u><strong>Population Viability</strong><br/></u>While the European Bison is no longer threatened by extinction, most free-living subpopulations are small and isolated. Small, isolated subpopulations are at risk from random catastrophic events, and also lose genetic diversity more quickly than large subpopulations through the process of genetic drift, which in turn can decrease the viability of populations through an accumulation of inbreeding and loss of adaptive capacity. To mitigate the loss of genetic diversity in these isolated subpopulations, bison population viability analyses have suggested increasing subpopulation size where possible, and otherwise restoring effective gene flow among subpopulations and managing under a meta-population framework, where gene flow can be restored either through the restoration of natural movements between populations or through the translocation of animals (or gametes) among populations (Daleszczyk and Bunevich 2009, Hartway <em>et al. </em>2019).<br/><br/><u><strong>Conservation planning</strong><br/></u>In 2004, the IUCN-SSC-BSG published a report entitled “<em>European Bison Status Survey and Conservation Action Plan</em>” (CAP, Pucek <em>et al.</em> 2004). With the free-living population growing from 1,848 in 2003 to 6,244 in 2019, it is clearly time for undertaking a new collaborative multi-stakeholder conservation planning process to produce an update to the 2004 CAP that includes a long-term conservation action plan with a very strong scientific basis and actionable consensus. Key issues needing to be examined include climate and environmental change, science advances and needs, increased interest in restoration programs involving large mammals, meta-population dynamics, conservation genetics (including the prevailing emphasis on separation of the Lowland (<em>B. b. bonasus</em>) and Caucasian (<em>Bison bonasus bonasus</em> x <em>B. b. caucasicus</em>) genetic lines amongst free-living subpopulations), disease ecology, habitat availability and shifting land use practices, restoration and translocation priorities, human dimensions, integrated <em>in situ</em> and <em>ex situ</em> management, and European Union and variable national and legal and policy status. The IUCN-SSC-BSG is formally partnering with the IUCN-SSC-Conservation Planning Specialist Group and multiple European wildlife conservation organisations to undertake collaborative conservation planning to produce an updated IUCN CAP that will serve as an innovative, efficient and effective milestone for its potential to empower new initiatives and result in better alignment of multi-national conservation strategies and actions.<br/><br/><u><strong>Science needs</strong><br/></u>There is a critical need to enhance levels of collaborative and comparative science. Enhancing the effectiveness and sustainability of restoration activities should include testing of alternative hypotheses about landscape ecology, analysing habitat availability and suitability for optimal restoration designs, and comparative analyses of population viability and potential meta-population management strategies (see Daleszczyk and Bunevich 2009, Hartway <em>et al.</em> 2020, <em>Kerley et al</em> 2012, 2020). Comparative analyses of the effects of selective culling and supplemental feeding will be important for improving the efficiency and effectiveness of local conservation management. Also needed are comparative analyses of bison ecology across the historic range (e.g. population ecology, metapopulation macrophysiology, foraging ecology, competition with sympatric wild ungulates, ecological cascades, ethology, etc.), comprehensive disease and parasitology monitoring, and innovative social science that addresses the human dimensions of bison recovery.<br/><br/><u><strong>Adaptive Management</strong><br/></u>Achieving the full ecological recovery of the European Bison conservation will require collaboration of researchers, managers, and policymakers to develop and implement science-based adaptive management (Kerley and Knight 2010). There is a need to institutionalise evidence-based capacity to learn and adjust management as needed to restore bison to optimal habitats that secure the needs of the species throughout the year and spacious enough to maintain viable populations (Samojlik <em>et al. </em>2019). It is very important to adaptively manage for an effective and efficient balance of supplementary feeding and culling with conservation of the full extent of the species naturally evolved ecology. Adaptive management can also serve as a framework to restore large heterogeneous landscapes that include forests, meadows and open habitats for both existing and future bison herds, thereby potentially lowering the expense of supplementary feeding when introducing to suitable habitats; to gain and employ improved understanding of the human dimensions of bison recovery and thereby enhance active social support that includes financial and habitat commitments; and to strive for effective long-term genetic conservation and population viability by establishing sufficiently large meta-populations that link smaller isolated populations across regional geographic ranges.&#160;</p><p><strong></strong></p>",Palearctic,,false,false,Global

This species has been found in rocky areas and under bark on trees across the island  (Van Denburgh 1912); in artificial situations it colonizes walls and buildings.&#160;This species lays eggs in October and November in rocky areas (Fitter <em>et al.</em> 2000).,"San Cristóbal is the second most heavily-populated island in the Galápagos, and introduced predators - particularly cats (which have been observed to eat this gecko&#160;- D. Cisneros-Heredia pers. obs.), rats and dogs - represent the major threat to this nocturnal species. It appears to have been displaced from the centre of urban areas by the introduced house gecko&#160;<em>Lepidodactylus lugubris</em>, although as a larger species than <em>Phyllodactylus darwinii </em>this effect may be less pronounced than in that species. While this is a localized threat, it may be significant if the species is under pressure also in other parts of the island from introduced mammals. No information is available on population trends in natural habitats to determine whether it is declining as a result of predation.","It is frequent to uncommon in both natural and inhabited areas in targeted surveys in the western part of the island (D.

In 2009, at most 25 individuals were found in the same areas investigated by the previous study (D. Cisneros-Heredia unpubl. data).

Commonwealth gillnet, hook and trap fisheries, and South Australian prawn trawl fisheries operate over a portion of its range, although no information on catch is currently available.

Any remaining population(s) are therefore assumed to be extremely small and localized.<br/><br/>The known animals were obtained from three localities, but in at least two cases are thought to have been purchased in markets and had likely been transported there by humans.<br/><br/>Remaining animals of the species are under exceptional threat from collection, as the species potentially commands a very high price in the (illegal) pet trade, as well as in the consumption trade.","No information is available beyond the general assumption that <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Cuora yunnanensis</span> inhabits streams, lakes and/or swampy wetlands, the typical lifestyle of most <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Cuora</span> species. The type locality, Kunming, is at just under 1,900 m altitude; a distribution range of 2,000-2,260 m altitude is generally cited (e.g., Yu 1998, Lau and Shi 2000), but has been questioned as being too high (Blanck 2005).<br/><br/>Females reach up to 17.5 cm CL at 850 grams, males about 15 cm at 375 grams (Zhou and Zhao 2004, Zhou 2005, Zhou <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2008). In captivity, one or two clutches per female per year, of 4–8 eggs per clutch (maximum eight eggs per year), have been reported (Zhou <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2008). Hatchlings emerge after 64–68 days of incubation at 28–30­°C, and measure 32–35 mm at a weight of 6.5–8.3 grams (Zhou <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2008).","The main site of presumed historical occurrence of <span style=""font-style: italic;"">yunnanensis</span>, Kunming, is now an expansive city surrounded mainly by agricultural fields especially in the flat areas. The adjacent Kunming Lake is heavily polluted; the lake's endemic newt <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Cynops wolterstorfii</span> is considered extinct as a result of water pollution. Monofilament fishing nets were seen abandoned at the lakeshore in 2005, suggesting a risk of accidental drowning if <span style=""font-style: italic;"">yunnanensis</span> persists (van Dijk pers obs 2005). Substantial areas of the lake have been encroached upon by expansion of the city of Kunming, though a large area of open water remains. The Western Hills area has been extensively developed for tourism, including roads, trails and a cable car, and contains a long-term settlement of rural people tending vegetable and fruit gardens (and presumably gathering local flora, fungi and fauna, potentially including turtles). Hence, habitat degradation and destruction are believed to represent threats.<br/><br/><span style=""font-style: italic;"">Cuora yunnanensis</span> has been restricted from international trade by inclusion in CITES Appendix II in 2000, but is reputed to be worth about USD 50,000 for the first animal to emerge from China into the international pet trade (Blanck <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2006), and several USD 1,000 for subsequent animals, generating strong incentives to search for and smuggle out any animal.","The type series of <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Cuora yunnanensis </span>consists of five animals collected at Kunming by a single collector, plus one from Tongchuan [Zhongping] collected by another collector, and another three museum specimens from Kunming, all collected at the same time (Parham <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2004, Blanck 2005), suggesting that the species was not particularly rare at this early period of exploration (1900–1906).

Based on this information, the Asian Turtle Trade Working Group (2000) considered the species extinct. However, a single animal, without data on its origin, was purchased in a Kunming market in 2004 (Zhou and Zhao 2004), showing that this conclusion was premature. At least two animals have subsequently been reported and are held in captivity (Zhou 2005, He <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2007, Yang and Rao 2008).

It may have been a beach dweller, as are other species in the genus, and if so tsunami waves may have destroyed its last littoral habitats in Martinique. The 1843 earthquake in Guadeloupe produced waves that may have submerged its habitats, as a 1-2 m increase of sea level was detected hundreds of kilometres from the epicentre.

Its final extinction, presumed to be the result of a hurricane in 1928, follows a long period of decline inferred from fossil evidence and the historical literature. This decline, occurring first on large islands on which invasive mammals are now widespread, with populations surviving longer on satellite islands, is consistent with patterns of extinction following the introduction of mongoose and other exotic predators to Caribbean islands, although literature evidence suggests that the species may have had a restricted distribution on or have been lost from the large island of Guadeloupe some time prior to the first known introduction of mongoose.","This was reportedly a ground-dwelling species that fed on carrion, including scraps dropped when cleaning fish, plants, and other lizards (including dead members of the same species) (Du Tertre 1659, 1667).",It is thought that a hurricane that passed through&#160;Grand Ilet in 1928 was responsible for the final extinction of this species.

As this author was the first to propose a plausible, specific source of origin for the lizard, targeted surveys have not been possible to confirm beyond reasonable doubt that it is now extinct, and a specimen accessioned in 1965 without a collection date may represent a more recent collection than those reported in the historical literature.",There is no information about the habitats or ecology of this species (Henderson and Powell 2009).,"Nothing is known of any threats to this species, as its distribution is inferred wholly from interpretations in recent and historical literature.

This includes another species known from St. Croix and collected at the same time, <em>Spondylurus magnacruzae </em>(Hedges and Conn 2012). The disappearance of these species has been attributed to the introduction of Indian mongoose (<em>Herpestes javanicus</em>) in the islands, which arrived on St. Croix at roughly the same time as this species' only known record was taken (Hedges and Conn 2012). It is possible that other processes, including predation by other exotic mammals and possibly agricultural and urban expansion, may have threatened this species (Hedges and Conn 2012).

The full petition ruling is available <a href=""https://www.iucnredlist.org/resources/petitions"">here</a>.<br/> <br/>The SPC received the petition on 20 May 2021. The petition argued that the Extinct (EX) listing of this species was not supported by the available information. The SPC sent additional questions to both the petitioners and the assessors, as well as several independent experts. This ruling is based on the information provided in the justifications and addenda filed by the petitioners and the assessors as part of the formal petitions process, the information SPC received in response to its questions, publicly available information on this and related species, the IUCN Red List Categories and Criteria (IUCN 2001) and the guidelines for their use (IUCN SPC 2019), and relevant scientific literature on extinction.<br/><br/>Both the assessors and the petitioners provided much information on the life history of handfish species. This gave the SPC an important context for its deliberations. However, neither the assessors, nor the petitioners placed sufficient focus on a quantitative evaluation of the extent to which surveys are exhaustive, which is key to the assessment of Extinct listing. Because this is the most critical consideration, the SPC concludes that the information provided in the original assessment does not support the EX listing, and rules that the listing of Smooth Handfish now be changed to DD. However, as discussed in the petition ruling, the SPC suspects that there is actually sufficient information and expert knowledge to quantify the extent to which surveys have been exhaustive, and strongly recommends that a revised assessment is undertaken.</p>","The habitat of this species is unknown, but other handfish species in southeastern Tasmania occur in rocky and sandy habitats.",Specific threats to this species are not known.,This species is known only from the holotype collected in 1802.,Unknown,The only&#160;known specimen of this species was collected during a voyage to Australia in 1800 to 1804; it&#160;was amongst the earliest Australian fish species collected.&#160;No other data are available except a locality recorded as ‘Australian seas’.

It is believed that more than six or seven individuals were inhabiting the cave where the four type specimens were collected (Goodwin 1979).&#160; It has also been identified unambiguously in flight from echolocation call sequences recorded in October 2006 in disturbed but dense riparian vegetation 2.5 km South of Laleia in Manatuto district, on the eastern side of the Laleia River at an elevation of 40 metres asl (Armstrong 2007a); and north of the Paitchau Range in evergreen riparian forest adjacent to the Ira Siquero River in Nino Conis Santana National Park at an elevation of 350 metres (Armstrong 2007b).
