This is a communal species found in groups of 3-11 individuals, and a single cave may hold up to 50 individuals in multiple groups (Somaweera and Somaweera 2009). Communal nest sites can contain up to 100 eggs and the same site may be used over multiple breeding season (Somaweera and Somaweera 2009). Animals are nocturnally active on trees outside caves at night, and remain in dark areas during the day (Somaweera and Somaweera 2009).","Removal of forest for varied reasons, including settlement and agriculture, represents a threat to this species, and forest fires may have some impact. Most suitable habitat in its range lies within protected areas which limits large-scale habitat destruction, despite some encroachment. There is some quarrying but it is small-scale and restricted to the north of the range. Granite blasting has been observed both within and outside protected areas, following which the species has not been detected (M. Wickramasinghe pers. comm. 2019). The major threats to this species are the conversion of caves to hermitages (and the attendant expansion of temple complexes) and destruction of suitable rocky habitat (including that within protected areas) in order to obtain building materials (Karunarathna and Amarasinghe 2011, S. Karunarathna pers. comm. 2019), and these practices are common within protected areas. There is some persecution as a result of traditional beliefs (T. Amarasinghe pers. comm. 2019).

The topography of portions of this area consists of rocky limestone cliffs and terraces, interspersed with red soil depressions that are used for nesting. Trees and shrubs are widely spaced without forming a closed canopy, however, the vegetation can be dense when cacti and vines are prominent. In other portions of the range the plant community is a succulent-dominated, 5–6 m tall dry forest on white sandy soil with low topography. Ricord’s Rock Iguanas feed on fruits, leaves, and flowers of a variety of plants, depending on seasonal availability, as well as insects and vertebrates (Pasachnik and Martin-Vélez 2017).&#160;<br/><br/>Like other rock iguanas, this species is diurnal, spending the night in retreats. These iguanas often use soil burrows as retreats, which they continue to expand over time. However, hollow tree trunks and rock crevices are also used as retreats. Retreat entrances are often dug under dense thorny vegetation, shrubs, stumps, or exposed rocks. Nesting sites are constructed in sand or clay. Nesting occurs from March to June and nests have 2–23 eggs (S.A. Pasachnik unpublished data 2012–2015). The incubation period is approximately 95–100 days, with hatching occurring from July to September. Hatching success is approximately 95% on average. Both sexes reach maturity at 2–3 years of age. The maximum size of this iguana is 46 cm snout-to-vent length and 54 cm tail length. The average size at birth is 9.6 cm snout-to-vent length and 14.7 cm tail length.","Habitat reduction and degradation resulting from the clearing of vegetation for agricultural use, charcoal production, harvesting of fuelwood and hardwoods, over-browsing by free-ranging livestock, and limestone and sand mining are the major threats to these iguanas (Rupp <em>et al</em>. 2007). Invasive alien species also pose significant threats through predation of adults, juveniles, and eggs (feral dogs and cats, mongoose, and pigs), and competition for food from mammalian herbivores (cows, goats, and pigs) (Rupp&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2008, De La Rosa and Carreras De León 2016). Cows also pose a threat to the nesting habitat by collapsing iguana nests. Hispaniola is affected by hurricanes on a regular basis, causing flooding and wind damage to the iguana habitat.","All available data indicate that the historical range of Ricord’s Rock Iguana was small and disjunct. Although the current subpopulations likely exist in the same areas as they did historically, observations indicate overall population decline. This decline is most evident in the Haitian population, which likely has fewer than 50 individuals total, based on the number of nests recorded (Rupp and Accimé 2011). Researchers and local inhabitants in the Dominican Republic agree that until the mid-1970s population densities of mature individuals were much higher than they are at present. Lacking rigorous density calculations, a reasonable population estimate across the three populations in the Dominican Republic is 3,000–4,000 mature individuals. This estimate is based on known nests per year and minimal capture rates within a section of the range.",Decreasing,"Ricord’s Rock Iguana (<em>Cyclura ricordii</em>) is known only from southern Hispaniola, where it is restricted to the arid Valle de Neiba and the most xeric portion of the Peninsula de Barahona coastal lowlands. The two regions are separated by the mesic Sierra de Bahoruco (Massif de la Selle in Haiti), with three peaks exceeding 2,000 m that form an extensive ecological barrier. Past drier Pleistocene climates may have allowed genetic exchange between the subpopulations. In the Valle de Neiba, the species can be found on Cabritos Island, within the hypersaline Enriquillo Lake, and on a portion of the shoreline of the same lake. On the Baharona Peninsula, the species is restricted to a small area near within the Pedernales Department. In 2007, a very small subpopulation was discovered near the town of Anse-à-Pitres, Haiti. This subpopulation is confined to a small karst limestone terrace and includes only one nesting area on a nearby sandy beach (Rupp and Accimé 2011). These iguanas can be found from 43 m below sea level (Cabritos Island, Enriquillo Lake) up to 439 m asl (Dine 2009). The total potential extent of occurrence for Ricord’s Rock Iguana is approximately 1,307 km<sup>2</sup> (measured by minimum convex polygon; Y. León unpublished data 2014.) and the area of occupancy is 230 km<sup>2</sup> among four subpopulations (calculated using a 1x1 km grid overlay).","Ricord’s Rock Iguanas are threatened by hunting for food and by trade to a lesser degree. Although harvesting may have declined due to a decrease in overall population size, iguanas continue to be captured opportunistically in most areas where they remain. In addition, poaching of eggs from nests has been documented in Haiti (Rupp and Accimé 2011).<br/><br/>The international trade of this iguana from the Dominican Republic has been controlled since the mid-1980s, by its inclusion in Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). However, Haiti is not a CITES signatory and thus the iguana does not benefit from this level of trade protection. A recent survey in Haiti, however, did not document evidence of international trade (Rupp and Accimé 2011).",Terrestrial,"In the Dominican Republic, all extant Ricord´s Rock Iguana subpopulations are found, at least in part, within the boundaries of the Jaragua-Bahoruco-Enriquillo Biosphere Reserve (UNESCO 2017). The Cabritos Island subpopulation, and part of the subpopulation on the shore of Enriquillo Lake, are also afforded protection via the Enriquillo Lake and Cabritos Island National Park, and Loma Charco Azul Biological Reserve. A portion of the subpopulation located in the Pedernales Department occurs within a municipally-protected area, which was developed in 2005 (Rupp <em>et al</em>. 2009). In Haiti, the area that supports these iguanas does not have any legal protection status nor is it included in the national system of protected areas. After garnering local support, a proposal was submitted for the declaration of Municipal Protected Status for the Ricord’s Rock Iguana and its habitat, by creating a Wildlife Reserve (Rupp and Accimé 2011). This proposal was initially approved, however, with the most recent change in government the decision was retracted.<br/><br/>Ricord’s Rock Iguanas themselves are also protected nationally by Dominican wildlife regulations, however, enforcement is lacking thus the aforementioned threats persist. The status of protective legislation is uncertain in Haiti.<br/><br/>A local non-governmental organization, Grupo Jaragua, has been managing conservation efforts for these iguanas in the southwest Dominican Republic since 2003. These efforts include habitat monitoring and restoration, outreach and education, and land acquisition of important conservation sites. Grupo Jaragua is also actively mitigating threats by combating charcoal activity, providing alternative livelihoods, and controlling invasive species. Grupo Jaragua is active in Haiti as well but to a lesser extent, focusing mostly on education and land protection of the only known Ricord’s Rock Iguana subpopulation in Haiti.<br/><br/>Future efforts should focus on elucidating populations size and trends and strengthening local management plans. Habitat acquisition and protection should be evaluated across the shore of Enriquillo Lake. Eradication of invasive mammals on Cabritos Island was recently completed by the non-profit organization Island Conservation. Rigorous invasive species controls should be expanded to all subpopulations, along with local outreach and education campaigns.",Neotropical,,false,false,Global

There are approximately eight subpopulations and local extirpations are known to have occurred throughout the island. These iguanas were said to be common until the 1950s, but more recent field surveys demonstrate iguana densities are low in most areas where they presently occur and appear to be declining. We estimate that the percent reduction over the past two generations and one generation into the future, approximately 65 years, will be at least 60% in total. The past and current threats from habitat degradation, exploitation, and invasive alien species (predators and competitors) are unlikely to cease. The southwestern portion of the Dominican Republic is the only remaining region where populations of these iguanas can be considered stable. However, this area remains threatened and there are plans for major development within this part of the species range. This species qualifies for listing as Endangered.<br/><br/>This is a genuine change from the previous assessment based on additional knowledge of the threats and status of the species throughout its range.","Hispaniolan Rhinoceros Iguanas are most abundant in, but not restricted to, tropical dry and moist lowland forests and shrublands. These tropical dry forests are characterized by xeric, rocky habitats of eroded limestone in coastal terraces and lowlands of mainland Hispaniola and several offshore islands. Iguanas can be found to a lesser extent in dry lowland grasslands and highly degraded former forests.<br/><br/>Like other rock iguanas, this species is diurnal, spending the night in retreats. Rock crevices, caves, soil or sand burrows, and tree hollows provide shelter. Trees and exposed rocks are used by iguanas for basking. Nesting occurs in June and July with hatching in September and October (Rupp <em>et al</em>. 2008). Females lay from 2 to 25 eggs, with an average clutch size of 14.5. Females guard nests for several days after laying in some locations but not all, and incubation lasts approximately 85 days (S.A. Pasachnik unpublished data 2012–2013). Based on captive populations of iguanas, females likely become sexually mature at 3–4 years of age. The maximum size of this iguana is 57 cm snout-to-vent length and 58 cm tail length. The size at birth is 10.4 cm snout-to-vent length and 20.3 cm tail length. Hispaniolan Rhinoceros Iguanas feed on fruits, leaves, and flowers of a variety of plants, depending on availability, as well as insects and vertebrates (Pasachnik and Martin-Vélez 2017).","Habitat destruction due to charcoal production, tourist development, agriculture, livestock grazing, and bauxite mining, represent major threats to Hispaniolan Rhinoceros Iguanas in both the Dominican Republic and Haiti. In the Dominican Republic, the dry forest regions are the most economically depressed, and exploitation of these habitats for charcoal and fuelwood represent important sources of income. Unfortunately, these areas also represent preferred iguana habitat (Ottenwalder 2000). Economic depression and habitat exploitation are much higher for Haiti. Invasive alien species also pose significant threats through predation by feral dogs and cats, mongoose, and pigs (which prey on adults, juveniles, and eggs) and competition for food from mammalian herbivores (cows, goats, and pigs). Cows are also known to negatively impact nesting areas by collapsing nests. Hispaniola is affected by hurricanes on a regular basis, causing flooding and wind damage to iguana habitat.","Hispaniolan Rhinoceros Iguanas are thought to have been common and widespread in low elevation zones until the early 1950s (Ottenwalder 2000), but accurate information concerning population estimates through time is lacking. In the Dominican Republic, approximately eight subpopulations exist, of varying size and stability. Field surveys suggest that populations outside of the Dominican Isla Beata and the southern extreme of the Barahona Peninsula, inside Parque Nacional Jaragua, are in decline (S.A. Pasachnik and R. Carreras De León pers. obs. 2012–2015). On Isla Beata, all age classes are abundant and juveniles comprise approximately one-third of the population (Grupo Jaragua 1994). In Haiti, the number of subpopulations is largely unknown but at least five are thought to exist. Local extirpations are known from both Dominican Republic and Haiti.",Decreasing,"The Hispaniolan Rhinoceros Iguana is endemic to, and distributed broadly throughout, Hispaniola, including many of its offshore islands (for example, Isla Beata, Isla Saona, Île de la Gonâve, Île de la Petit Gonâve, Île Grande Cayemite and Île de la Tortue; ITWG 2016). Their current geographic range is fragmented relative to their likely more continuous historical distribution. They are primarily associated with xeric regions, however, they can also be found in tropical moist forest such as in the Samaná Province. The highest densities of iguanas are found within the Provinces of Azua, Barahona, Independencia, and Pedernales in the Dominican Republic.<br/><br/>These iguanas can be found from 43 m below sea level (Isla Cabritos, Lago Enriquillo) up to 400 m asl. Anecdotal evidence suggests that these iguanas can occur at higher elevations, however, exact locations could not be confirmed.","Hispaniolan Rhinoceros Iguanas are threatened by illegal hunting of subadults and adults for food and local trade. In the Dominican Republic, iguanas are rendered into an oil that is used for medicinal and cosmetic purposes (S.A. Pasachnik and R. Carreras De León pers. obs. 2012). The international trade of wild animals from the Dominican Republic has been controlled since the mid-1980s, by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), however, no such control exists in Haiti. National trade of iguanas within the Dominican Republic is controlled to some extent, but there is still substantial movement of individuals throughout the country for pets and tourist exhibits, known as iguanarios. At present, the National Zoo in Santo Domingo (ZooDom) functions as a repository for confiscated iguanas that are held in captivity until their release on zoo grounds or into iguanarios throughout the country (Pasachnik and Carreras De León 2014). The movement of iguanas between iguanarios and subsequent accidental or intentional release could pose a threat to the health of the species through the introduction of pathogens or the loss of local adaptations (S.A. Pasachnik and R. Carreras De León pers. obs. 2012–2015).",Terrestrial,"In the Dominican Republic, many iguana subpopulations are afforded some level of protection as they are found within existing national parks and reserves. However, management in these protected areas is not intensive, and in some cases is restricted to legislation only (Pasachnik <em>et al</em>. 2016). Protected areas supporting iguana subpopulations include Loma Charco Azul Biological Reserve, the National Parks of El Morro, Francisco Alberto Caamano, Anacaona, La Gran Sabana, Jaragua, Sierra de Bahoruco, Lago Enriquillo and Isla Cabritos, Del Este, Sierra Martin Garcia, the Natural Monuments of Dunas de las Calderas, Las Caobas, Los Cacheos, Caba Samaná, Laguna Cabral Wildlife Reserve, and the Cabo Rojo-Bahia de la Aquilas National Recreation Area. No formal protected areas are known within the present distribution of iguanas in Haiti.<br/><br/>Hispaniolan Rhinoceros Iguanas themselves are also protected nationally by Dominican wildlife regulations, however, enforcement is lacking, thus the aforementioned threats persist. These iguanas are also listed on the National Red List of the Dominican Republic (Ministerio de Medio Ambiente y Recursos Naturales de la República Dominicana 2011). The status of protective legislation is uncertain in Haiti, although the Hispaniolan Rhinoceros Iguana was included on a list of protected wildlife by the Haitian Ministry of Agriculture in the 1980s. This species is listed in Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). Compliance with international trade regulations is effective in the Dominican Republic, aside from occasional incidents of animal smuggling. Haiti is not a CITES signatory country and thus trade is harder to regulate and document.<br/><br/>A local non-governmental organization, Grupo Jaragua, has been managing conservation efforts for these iguanas in the southwest Dominican Republic since 2004. These efforts include habitat monitoring and restoration, outreach and education, and land acquisition of important conservation sites. Grupo Jaragua is also actively mitigating threats by combating charcoal activity, providing alternative livelihoods, and controlling invasive species.<br/><br/>Although Grupo Jaragua is actively monitoring iguanas in the southwestern portion of the Dominican Republic, however, the status of subpopulations outside of this area is largely unknown. Preliminary data demonstrates a population decline across the Dominican Republic (S.A. Pasachnik and R. Carreras De León pers. obs. 2012–2015). Future efforts should focus on elucidating populations trends outside of the southwestern Dominican Republic and in Haiti, as well as the development of an island-wide management plan. Additional efforts should focus on documenting the movement and release of captive iguanas, as well as a thorough investigation of the iguanarios to verify their legality and the origin of their iguanas.",Neotropical,,false,false,Global

The&#160;Hellshire Hills area contains one of the best remaining examples of dry tropical forest in the insular Caribbean. It is strictly illegal to cut trees in Hellshire, however, lack of effective management has permitted rampant habitat loss in Hellshire, primarily for the production of charcoal (Wilson 2011).<br/><br/>Two specimens from Jackson Bay Cave were swabbed for the presence of amphibian chytrid fungus,<em>&#160;Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis </em>(<em>Bd</em>), but tested negative&#160;(Holmes&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2014); while the population could be climatically buffered from the fungus at present, chytridiomycosis may represent a serious threat as climatic conditions continue to change into the future (I. Holmes pers. comm. 2020). The presence of&#160;<em>Rhinella marina&#160;</em>has been documented inside Jackson Bay cave and predation on the Portland Ridge Frog could result in declines, but further work is needed to understand the severity of this threat (D.

Winter clusters are smaller (10 individuals), and the species is often solitary at this time of year (S. Aulagnier pers. comm. 2007). It was thought that European, African and southwest Asian populations were isolated from each other, but range extensions as a result of recent records indicate that they might not be as isolated as was previously thought.",Decreasing,"<em>Plecotus kolombatovici</em> is a Mediterranean endemic with its distribution fragmented into three parts: southern regions of the Balkans and Asia Minor (Cyprus, Turkey, Syria, Lebanon and probably into Israel, Palestine and Jordan), northeast Libya (Cyrenaica) and northwest Africa from Morocco to northwest Libya, it was found in Malta and Pantellaria (Spitzenberger <em>et al.</em> 2006).

4446084,14581,Neotoma magister,Near Threatened,,2008,2008-06-30 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"Listed as Near Threatened, although it has a large range, it is a microhabitat specialist being dependent on rocky areas for its habitat, and it has experienced declines in many parts of its range with a significant percentage of its historical range no longer occupied. This decline is close to 30% making it close to qualifying for Vulnerable under criterion A2c. The cause(s) of the decline are not well understood.","Typical habitat is rocky cliffs and talus slopes. These woodrats make midden mounds and stick piles among rocks, but secluded nest sites generally are not within stick houses (see Hayes and Harrison 1992).<br/><br/>Throughout its range, this species is associated with extensive rocky areas such as outcrops, cliffs, talus slopes with boulders and crevices, and caves. It occasionally uses abandoned buildings but generally avoids humans. It generally occurs at higher elevations (to about 1,000 m) and is rarely found in lowlands or open areas. Because it is a habitat specialist, geographic range portrayals grossly exaggerate its true distribution. For example, the global range map shows approximately 40% of the land surface of Pennsylvania as included in Allegheny woodrat distribution, when in fact the Pennsylvania surface rock habitat currently occupied by woodrats covers less than one percent (0.77%) of the state (Hassinger pers. comm.).<br/><br/>In southern New York, New Jersey, and adjacent Pennsylvania, woodrat habitat ""consists of extensive boulder fields at the base of ridges with rock outcrops. These talus slopes consist of large boulders (10-20 ft. [3-6 m] across) piled in several layers. <em>Neotoma</em> lives among the cave like spaces formed by the piled boulders"" (Sciascia 1990). <br/><br/>Referring to the mountainous area of Pennsylvania, Merritt (1987) wrote, ""limestone caves, rocky cliffs and accumulations of residual sandstone boulders marked by deep crevices with underground galleries represent favored habitat."" Hall (1985) pointed out that good habitat is found ""specifically at water gaps where cliff faces and boulder piles are usually abundant."" Unpublished data from Pennsylvania Natural Diversity Inventories (eastern and western offices) make frequent references to woodrat occurrences in sandstone, limestone, or shale outcrops and cliffs, usually with crevices or abundant boulders; also solution caves and abandoned limestone quarries and mines. Associated forest is varied, including cove hardwoods, hemlock-birch, oak-pine, and various combinations of oaks, maples, hickories, beech, and yellow poplar (tulip-tree). Grape, mountain laurel, rhododendron and ferns are frequently mentioned. <br/><br/>In West Virginia, woodrats are common in caves, rock shelters, outcrops with deep crevices, and riverbanks with an abundance of sandstone rocks and boulders. <br/><br/>""In Maryland, this species is found predominately in cliffs, caves and rocky areas in the three western-most counties, and along cliffs of the Potomac River to the vicinity of Washington, D.C."" (Feldhammer <em>et al.</em> 1984). In western Maryland ""Pottsville Sandstone outcrops [provide] massive, blocky boulders and extensive cliffs with numerous crevices and miniature cave-like situations"" (Thompson 1984). <br/><br/>In Indiana, extant populations are restricted primarily to south-facing limestone bluffs on the Ohio River, where there are den sites in the rock and dense red-cedar (Cudmore 1983, Scott Johnson pers. comm.).<br/><br/>In Kentucky, ""cliffs with deep crevices, caves, or large boulders piled in such a way as to form numerous retreats and shelters are favored"" (Barbour and Davis 1974). In Tennessee, ""rocky cliffs, caves and fissures or tumbled boulders on the sides of mountains are the preferred habitat"" (Hamilton 1943), and in North Carolina it is ""rocky places and abandoned buildings at elevations above 3,000 ft (900 m)"" (Adams 1987). Castleberry <em>et al</em>. (2001) suggest that forest clearcutting has minimal impact on woodrat movements, home range, and habitat use, as long as sufficient intact forest is retained adjacent to colonies. They mention, however, that harvesting methods that selectively remove important mast-producing tree species may represent the greatest threat from forest management.<br/><br/>A large house of sticks, leaves, and miscellaneous debris is built, usually within a cave, crevice, or other well-protected place. This may be a mound like a muskrat house (typical construction in the range of other subspecies), but is more often open, giving the impression of a large bird's nest (Poole 1940). Outside diameter is about 35-60 cm (Patterson 1933) and the inner cavity is about 12 cm across (Poole 1940). The nest is lined with shredded bark of grape, red cedar, hemlock, or basswood, grass, fur, rootlets, and sometimes feathers (Poole 1940, Merritt 1987).<br/><br/>Woodrats are basically solitary and unsociable, frequently fighting one another. Each lives alone in its house, except when breeding and raising young. Poole (1949) found ""a great deal of individuality"" in temperament, behaviour, food preferences, etc., among his captive Allegheny woodrats. When upset, woodrats may chatter their teeth or stomp their hind feet (Wiley 1980). <br/><br/>Near the nests are found piles of sticks and trash called middens. Part of the materials found in woodrat houses and middens appears to be cached food in the form of nuts, seeds, berries, cuttings of vegetation, and mushrooms. But there may also be miscellaneous bits of trash, including rags, bits of metal, bones, pieces of glass, paper, etc. Newcombe (1930) and Poole (1940) compiled lists of such materials. The function of this compulsive collecting is unknown. <br/><br/>Though solitary and territorial, woodrats most often occur in clusters due to patchiness of the rock outcrop, talus, and cave habitat, and conform to the concept of a metapopulation (Hassinger <em>et al</em>. 1996). Home ranges are small, 0.26-0.6 ha (Wright and Hall 1996); usually less than about 90 m across (Burt and Grossenheider 1976). Poole (1940) reported movements of 183 m and 92 m by two woodrats in Pennsylvania. Foraging movements, while often focused within rock habitat, may extend beyond the protection of rocks up to 160 m from the den site (Wright and Hall 1996). Den shifts tend be less than 100 m with a median of 40 m (Wright 1998), and woodrats, particularly females, often live their entire lives in the same outcrop (Feller, pers. obs., 1998). There are reports of large unidirectional movements of displaced woodrats, e.g., 1 km and 4 km (McGowan 1993), as well as naturally dispersing individuals, 0.3-1 km (McGowan 1993), 1 km (Feller, pers. obs., 1995), and up to 6 km (Wright pers. comm., 1998). While woodrats can travel long distances between patches, as distances increase, the chance of successful emigration between patches is likely to decrease, particularly in the absence of protective rock crevices. Barriers to dispersal are not clearly known, as woodrats have been documented to traverse seemingly inhospitable terrain, including roads, small streams, and small fields, though movements are largely within rock habitat (Feller, pers. obs.; Mengak pers. comm., 1998; Wright pers. comm., 1998). However, woodrats display unwary behaviour when crossing roads (Feller, pers. obs.), and road kills have been documented (Feller, pers. obs., 1993; McGowan 1993). <br/><br/>Predators include owls, skunks, weasels, foxes, raccoons, bobcats and large snakes. Humans have been killing woodrats for thousands of years - first for food, and much later out of prejudice, because of a resemblance to European rats. <br/><br/>White-footed mice compete with woodrats for food (Rainey 1956), and in Indiana, opossums, raccoons and turkey vultures may compete for den sites (Cudmore 1983). Woodrats support many ecto- and endoparasites, including fleas, ticks, mites, chiggers, botflies, nematodes, and tapeworms (Cudmore 1985). Bubonic plague (Schwartz and Schwartz 1959) and rabies (Dowda <em>et al</em>. 1981) have been reported in wild woodrats. Woodrats are primarily vegetarian, and food preferences vary widely among individuals. Leaves, twigs, fruits, and seeds of many plants are eaten. They are primarily nocturnal.","Possibly widespread deforestation and habitat fragmentation contributed to the initial decline of the species, isolating populations and eliminating dispersal and travel corridors (Sciascia pers. comm., 1994). Deforestation and associated reduction/elimination of food resources currently may be a threat to some local woodrat populations. Causes of the continuing decline are not yet fully understood, but some hypotheses have been offered. Probably the explanation lies in a combination of these and other factors that may differ locally in importance (Linzey 1990).<br/><br/>Parasitism by the raccoon roundworm (<em>Baylisascaris procyonis</em>) has been identified as a significant cause of mortality and a probable major factor in the decline in several states (McGowan 1993; Hicks pers. comm., 1994; Johnson <em>et al.</em> 1997; LoGiudice 2000). Although rarely fatal to raccoons, infestation may cause cerebrospinal nematodiasis in other species and has caused declines in some populations (Kazacos 1983). New York released and monitored woodrats in formerly occupied areas and all the animals died (50 total, including the released adults and their progeny); 11 of the 13 recovered carcasses were infected by the roundworms (McGowan 1993; Hicks pers. comm., 1994). Stone observed that woodrat decline in New York coincided with a marked increase in raccoon numbers (Linzey 1990). Hayes (unpublished research proposal) suggested that woodrats may be especially vulnerable for two reasons: 1) among other novel items, woodrats are known to carry back to their nests the faeces of other animals, which might include raccoon scats contaminated with <em>B. procyonis</em> eggs, and 2) a ""relatively long generation time increases the probability that individuals will become infested prior to reproduction."" Both of these reasons recently have been documented (McGowan pers. comm., 1994). Additionally, McGowan (pers. comm., 1994) found that woodrats may colonize areas where an infected woodrat has recently died, thus perhaps maintaining spread of the parasite. <br/><br/>Hall (1988) noticed a correlation between the spread of the gypsy moth (<em>Lymantria dispar</em>) and loss of woodrats in Pennsylvania. ""There is a possibility that acorns make up a significant part of the food supply of the species in Pennsylvania. Acorns may be important as a winter food source since they can be stored for long periods of time. Studies conducted by the Pennsylvania Game Commission show that acorn production drops to zero for several years following defoliation. Gypsy moth infestation has resulted in considerable mortality of oaks, especially along the poorer soils of rocky ridge tops. These are the areas where many rocky sites are found, which are ideal woodrat habitats."" In support of his argument, Hall noted that at three other sites where woodrats survived, other winter food sources were available. <br/><br/>In a similar theory, McGowan (pers. comm., 1994) speculated that the 1930-1940s permanent loss of the American chestnut (<em>Castanea dentata</em>) may be a factor. This chestnut was extremely hardy and a bountiful producer of mast, and its previous distribution essentially mirrors the historic distribution of the woodrat. Loss of this stable and predictable food source may have led to the continuing woodrat population decline.<br/><br/>Nawrot and Klimstra (1976) argued that the disappearance of a similar species, <em>N. floridiana illinoensis</em>, was likely due to two unusually severe winters. ""Despite a tolerance of <em>Neotoma</em> to many environmental conditions, severe winter weather appears to be a major factor in sudden woodrat population declines. Fitch and Rainy (1956) recorded a drastic decline in <em>Neotoma floridiana</em>abundance in Kansas after two winters of below-average temperatures and prolonged snow and ice cover. Significantly, this decimated population was unable to make substantial gains and continued to decline gradually for several years."" Weather also has been proposed as a factor in <em>Neotoma magister</em> decline, a view that is supported by the fact that the decline has been in the northern part of the range. Records in Pennsylvania and West Virginia over the past thirty years indicate ""below normal"" temperatures in critical months accompanying the observed shrinkage in range (Linzey pers. comm., 1994).<br/><br/>In some areas, including caves popular with spelunkers, human disturbance has been implicated in the disappearance of woodrat populations (e.g., Kirkland 1986). These woodrats do seem to avoid areas of human habitation or heavy human use, but many sites where they have disappeared are remote and rarely visited by people. <br/><br/>Habitat is generally inaccessible and undesirable for development, but strip mining of coal and limestone is a potential threat in many areas. Monty and Feldhamer (2002) stated that increased predation by great horned owls has been proposed as a threat, but owl predation seems highly unlikely as a reason for the decline. Populations often are small and isolated, hence highly susceptible to extirpation (Mengak pers. comm., 1994).","The total adult population size is unknown but likely is much larger than 10,000. Populations are localized and generally quite small (less than ten), apparently exhibiting a typical metapopulation structure. For example, in Pennsylvania the Allegheny woodrat population consists of 78 disjunct metapopulations (Butchkoski 2004). This species is represented by a very large number of occurrences or subpopulations (probably more than 200). The number of occurrences or subpopulations with good viability probably is substantially smaller than the total number of extant occurrences.<br/><br/>Populations in the northeastern United States have declined, while those in the southern portion of the range appear to have remained relatively stable. However, woodrats appear to be rare in Tennessee (Kennedy and Harvey 2001), and few specimens have been reported from Alabama, where present status is poorly known.<br/><br/>The species has disappeared from Connecticut, New York, most of eastern Pennsylvania, and all but one site in New Jersey. This decline has apparently been occurring for many years. Early sources (e.g., Newcombe 1930) remarked on the woodrat's decreasing range and abundance, and the most recent reports from Connecticut date from the 1930s (Goodwin 1935). Such a decline might be expected in the wake of human settlement, but in recent decades woodrat decline has been dramatic in New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Maryland. Apparent extirpation has occurred in at least 100 sites in northern Virginia (Buhlmann pers. comm., 1992). <br/><br/>Since the late 1960s woodrats in Pennsylvania have disappeared from sites where they once occurred, particularly in eastern and northwestern Pennsylvania; surveys of more than 360 sites from which woodrats have been reported yielded 20 metapopulations, but five of these metapopulation areas no longer support woodrats, and seven of them have fewer active colonies than in the past (C. Fergus, no date; www.pgc.state.pa.us, accessed April 2006). The species has disappeared from the southeastern portion of Pennsylvania and has declined in much of the rest of the state; at present, populations exist throughout much of Pennsylvania's south-central and southwestern counties, with a few remnant populations in eastern counties; mapped distribution indicates that the species no longer occurs in roughly half of the historically occupied range (Pennsylvania Game Commission website, woodrat information last updated in 2006).<br/><br/>In New Jersey, several populations have been extirpated for at least 20 years; the single known remaining population has been relatively stable in recent years, based on trapping results in 1999-2001 (New Jersey Division of Fish and Wildlife).<br/><br/>Woodrats were documented throughout their historical range in southeastern New York as recently as the mid-1960s, when they appeared to occupy all available habitat; those populations were extirpated by 1987; currently, the only woodrats in the state are immigrants that occasionally occupy a small patch of habitat on the New York-New Jersey border (this is the northern extreme of the habitat for the last remaining New Jersey woodrat population) (New York State Comprehensive Wildlife Conservation Strategy, 2005 revised draft). Reintroductions attempted in the early 1990s were unsuccessful.<br/><br/>This species may be represented by only one population in Ohio, or possibly it is extirpated; recent surveys failed to locate woodrats there (W. Peneston pers. comm., cited by Mengak 2002).<br/><br/>In Maryland, woodrat populations have been in decline for over two decades and continue to decline (Dan Feller, Maryland Natural Heritage Program pers. comm., cited by New York State Comprehensive Wildlife Conservation Strategy, 2005 draft).<br/><br/>In the early 1980s, extant populations in Indiana were reported from 20 sites (18 bluffs, two caves) adjacent to the Ohio River; in 1991-1992, live trapping surveys at 17 sites yielded a total of 101 woodrats at 12 (11 bluffs, one cave) of the 17 sites (Johnson 2002). Abundance in Indiana appears to have declined in recent decades. Population density for six sites in Indiana averaged 27.5/km of cliff habitat during the early 1980s (Cudmore 1985). During the 1990s density averaged about 11 individuals/km at 12 Indiana sites (Johnson <em>et al.</em> 1997).<br/><br/>Woodrat populations in the core of the range in West Virginia (Castleberry 2000), Virginia (Mengak 2000), and Kentucky (Thomas 1998) currently appear to be secure.<br/><br/>Cudmore (1983) estimated population densities of 8.3 to 71.9 woodrats per 1,000 m of cliff along the Ohio River in Indiana. According to Burt and Grossenheider (1976), populations of 5-8 adults per hectare are probably high.",Decreasing,"The species' range extends from western Connecticut (formerly (not mapped here)), southeastern New York (virtually extirpated (not mapped here)), northern New Jersey, and northern Pennsylvania southwestward through western Maryland, Tennessee, Kentucky, West Virginia, and northern and western Virginia (from the Blue Ridge westward) to northeastern Alabama (observed in several cave systems) and northwestern North Carolina (Hall 1981), with isolated populations north of the Ohio River in southern Ohio (where recent surveys failed to locate this species and so are not mapped here; W. Peneston pers. comm., cited by Mengak 2002) and southern Indiana (Whitaker and Hamilton 1998). Although Hall (1981) showed <em>N. magister</em> in the northwestern corner of Georgia, the Tennessee River is generally accepted as the southern range limit.",,Terrestrial,"Management guidelines resulting in the protection of Allegheny woodrat habitats are needed throughout the range. In particular, attention needs to be given to maintaining dispersal corridors among isolated populations. Continuing research on causes of the decline is also needed.<br/><br/>Examples of protected occurrences include those in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, Falls Ridge (a TNC preserve in Virginia), and the Deam Nature Preserve in Indiana. Many populations receive fairly good de facto protection in numerous areas with inaccessible cliffs and caves. Many additional occurrences are in state game areas and national forests and parks; these may afford some protection.<br/><br/>Rangewide surveys are needed to better determine status and trends.

Research indicates that an invariably fatal infectious cancer, Devil Facial Tumour Disease (DFTD), is responsible for the decline. DFTD currently occurs across the majority (estimated 60%) of the geographic range of the devil and continues to spread at variable rates (depending on location) in the range of 7-50 km/y (McCallum <em>et al</em>. 2007). Mark-recapture data from the most intensively studied population at Freycinet National Park estimated a decline in total population size of 30% in the first 3 years after disease arrival, with an annual decline in the adult (2+) population of 50% (Lachish <em>et al</em>. 2007). Both projections from these observed results and an epidemiological model predict local extinction at this site within 10 years of disease arrival (McCallum <em>et al</em>. 2007). At a second site, Mt William, where DFTD signs were first reported 10 years ago, mark-recapture methods estimate a decline of 90% over 10 years. There is no evidence either of a reduction in disease prevalence or of the rate of population decline as devil abundance reduces. On current information, we therefore project at least 90% population decline over the next 10 years across the 60% of the devil's distribution currently occupied by disease, with at least a 100 km extension of the disease distribution. Together, this would amount to a further decline (in excess of the 50% already observed) of at least 70% in the next 10 years, with widespread local extinctions. Whilst the cause of decline (DFTD) is understood, it has not ceased and its effects are not reversible with current knowledge.","Tasmanian Devils are found throughout Tasmania, in all native terrestrial habitats, as well as in forestry plantations and pasture, from sea level to all but the highest peaks of Tasmania (Jones and Rose 1996, Jones and Barmuta 2000). Densities are lowest in the buttongrass plains of the south-west and, prior to Devil Facial Tumour Disease (DFTD) emergence, highest in the dry and mixed sclerophyll forests and coastal heath of Tasmania's eastern half and north-west coast (Jones and Rose 1996). Open forests and woodlands are preferred, while tall or dense wet forests are avoided (Jones and Rose 1996; Jones and Barmuta 2000). The highest population densities are found in mixed patches of grazing land and forest or woodland. Relative trapping success and spool-and-line tracking indicate that Tasmanian Devils travel through lowlands, saddles and along creeks, avoiding steep slopes and rocky areas, and favouring predictably rich sources of food such as bush/pasture mosaics on farms, carcass and rubbish dumps, and roads (Jones and Barmuta 2000, Pukk 2005; N. Mooney and D. Pemberton pers. comm.).  Tasmanian Devils are able to reach very high densities, even in suboptimal habitat, if sufficient food and den sites are available. The 14 km² Badger Island at one time supported 120 Tasmanian Devils.<br/><br/>Seabird colonies, such as Short-tailed Shearwaters (or muttonbirds, <em>Puffinus tenuirostris</em>), are thought to have traditionally been a preferred habitat for Tasmanian Devils, providing an important food source. These are now much reduced along the east coast, but some sites remain along the west coast (D. Pemberton pers. comm.).<br/><br/>Dens are typically underground burrows (such as old wombat burrows), dense riparian vegetation, thick grass tussocks and caves. Adults are thought to remain faithful to their dens for life so den disturbance is destabilizing to populations (Owen and Pemberton 2005). In settled areas, dens are often under buildings which may be occupied by people.<br/><br/>Tasmanian Devils are the sole host to the only threatened invertebrate parasite, a tapeworm, <em>Dasyurotaenia robusta</em>, which is currently listed as Rare under the Tasmanian Threatened Species Protection Act 1995. <br/><br/><strong>Feeding</strong><br/>Tasmanian Devils are considered to be generalist predators and specialized scavengers; prey comprise primarily medium- to large-sized mammals, although they will eat large invertebrates such as bogong moths (<em>Agrotis infusa</em>) and the carcasses of any dead vertebrates, leading them to focus on areas where lambing, calving or wallaby shooting are in progress (Guiler 1970a, Jones and Barmuta 2000, Jones 2003, Owen and Pemberton 2005). Tasmanian Devils solitarily and actively hunt prey up to about 20 kg in size (including Bennett's Wallabies, <em>Macropus rufogriseus rufogriseus</em>, and Common Wombats, <em>Vombattus ursinus</em>) using a combination of ambush and short, moderate-speed pursuits (Jones 1998, 2003; Owen and Pemberton 2005).<br/><br/><strong>Movement patterns</strong><br/>Devils are usually nocturnal. There are no data to suggest seasonal changes in pattern of movement, apart from reduced activity of females with young in their dens (Pemberton 1990), although longer range movements (see below) are observed more frequently in winter. Tasmanian Devils occupy several different dens, changing dens every 1-3 days, and travelling a mean nightly distance of 8.6 km (Pemberton 1990). However, individuals have occasionally been observed to move up to 50 km in a single night (M. Jones pers. comm.). <br/><br/>Home ranges are found to overlap considerably. A typical home range across a two to four week period is estimated to be 13 km², ranging from 4-27 km² (Pemberton 1990). Different breeding females may be caught outside the same den site (Badger Island, N. Mooney unpubl.).<br/><br/><strong>Life-cycle</strong><br/>The Tasmanian Devil is promiscuous and breeds once a year during February to June (Hesterman <em>et al.</em> 2008; M. Jones pers. comm., Save the Tasmanian Devil Program unpubl.). In earlier studies the mating season was found to occur over a much shorter period, primarily during February-March (Guiler 1970b; D. Pemberton pers. comm.). <br/><br/>The majority of individuals mature at two years old; in DFTD-free areas, 5-10% of females typically mature at one year (Guiler 1970b; Hughes 1982; Pemberton 1990; Jones <em>et al</em>. in review; Hesterman <em>et al.</em>, in prep.). <br/><br/>Reproductive success is high in wild, non-diseased populations, with nearly all females of breeding age (2-4) bringing the full complement (n = 4) of pouched young through to weaning (Pemberton 1990; H. Hesterman unpubl.). Success to maturity of post-weaning individuals is unknown. <br/><br/>Tasmanian Devils are thought to breed and raise their young in traditional dens (Owen and Pemberton 2005), but new sites (e.g. under buildings) are also used. <br/><br/>Longevity in the wild is 5-6 years (Guiler 1978; Jones 2001; Jones <em>et al</em>. in press). The sum effect of mortality and emigration at Mount William (pre-disease) was estimated as 80% between the first and second year, followed by 20% in subsequent years (Pemberton 1990). <br/><br/>Increased contact between individuals in breeding season results in higher injury rates as a result of intra/inter-sexual aggression. DFTD is thought most likely to be most easily transmitted between Tasmanian Devils through biting (AUSVET 2005; Pearse and Swift 2006; Hamede 2007), therefore this is a time of higher potential for disease spread.","The major threat to this species at present is Devil Facial Tumour Disease (DFTD), compounded by roadkills, dog kills and persecution.<br/><br/><strong>Devil Facial Tumour Disease (DFTD)</strong><br/>Current evidence suggests that DFTD is an infectious, widespread disease (McCallum <em>et al.</em> 2007), so that any attempt to delineate boundaries between affected and unaffected locations is likely to be outdated swiftly. DFTD has been associated with local population declines of up to 89% since first reported (Hawkins <em>et al</em>. 2006, McCallum <em>et al</em>. 2007), indicated by long-term spotlighting data, widespread trapping and laboratory results. The declines, and the prevalence of the disease, have not eased off in any monitoring sites, and DFTD is present even in very low density areas. It is estimated that the adult population is approximately halving annually on the Freycinet peninsula (Lachish <em>et al</em>. 2007) with extinction predicted at this site 10-15 years after disease arrival (McCallum <em>et al</em>. 2007). Declines were most marked in areas where the disease had been reported earliest, in north-eastern and central eastern Tasmania.<br/><br/>Mean spotlighting sightings of Tasmanian Devils per 10 km route, obtained from across the core Tasmanian Devil range (eastern and north-western Tasmania), have declined by 53% since the first report of DFTD-like symptoms in 1996 (McCallum <em>et al</em>. 2007). The most immediately threatened location is thought to be the region where DFTD was reported prior to 2003: across 15,000 km² of eastern Tasmania. By 2005, the Devil Disease Project Team had confirmed DFTD in individuals found across 36,000 km² of eastern and central Tasmania (Hawkins <em>et al</em>. 2006). DFTD is now confirmed across more than 60% of the devil's overall distribution (C. Hawkins unpubl.), and there is evidence for continued geographical spread of the disease (Hawkins <em>et al</em>. 2006), so that Tasmanian Devils across between 51% and 100% of Tasmania may be, or have already been, subject to &gt;90% declines in a ten-year period. The currently affected region covers the majority of the formerly high-density eastern management unit, involving what was perhaps around 80% of the total population.<br/><br/>DTFD has resulted in the progressive loss of first the older adults from the population and then the younger adults (Lachish <em>et al</em>. 2007) so that populations are comprised of one and two year olds (Jones <em>et al</em>. in press, Lachish <em>et al</em>. submitted). As female devils usually breed for the first time at age two, they may not successfully raise a litter before they die of DFTD (Lachish <em>et al</em>. submitted). An increase in precocial breeding indicates some compensatory response, but as yet this appears to have been insufficient to counter mortality (Jones <em>et al</em>. in press, Lachish <em>et al</em>. submitted).<br/><br/>DFTD behaves like a frequency-dependent disease, probably because the majority of the injurious biting, which is the type of contact most likely to lead to disease transmission, occurs between adults during the mating season (Hamede <em>et al</em>. in press). Frequency-dependent diseases, which are typically sexually transmitted, can lead to extinction (McCallum and Jones 2006). Because transmission occurs between the sexes at mating irrespective of population density, these types of diseases lack a threshold density below which they become extinct.<br/><br/>Cannibalism is considered fairly common in Tasmanian Devils and renders the species particularly vulnerable to disease transmission (Pfennig <em>et al</em>. 1998; Jones <em>et al</em>. 2007). However, modes of transmission of DFTD are not as yet known.<br/><br/><strong>Road-kills</strong><br/>A recent three-year study of roadkill frequency on the main roads of Tasmania estimated 2,205 Tasmanian Devils are killed on roads annually (Hobday and Minstrell submitted). This suggests that 2-3.% of the total Tasmanian Devil population are killed on roads (based on an estimated population of 60,000–90,000 individuals at the time of the survey). The roaded parts of Tasmania closely match the core distribution area for Tasmanian Devils.<br/><br/>Roadkill was attributed as the cause of up to 50% and 20% of Tasmanian Devil death during a recording period of 17 months at Cradle Mountain and 12 months at Freycinet National Parks, respectively (Jones 2000; M. Jones pers. comm.). Local extinction and a similar rate of population decline at Cradle Mountain indicates that roadkill can cause local extinction, in which the road becomes a local sink (Jones 2000). Future impact is likely to remain at the same level.<br/><br/><strong>Dog kills</strong><br/>Reports of about 50 devils killed per year by poorly controlled dogs are served from about 20 dog owners. There is no obligation or incentive for such reports, and generally some hesitance even among those providing them, so the real figures are more likely of the order of several hundred devils killed by dogs each year.<br/><br/><strong>Foxes</strong><br/>There have been spasmodic, small-scale introductions of the Red Fox (<em>Vulpes vulpes</em>) into Tasmania since early European colonisation. Early incursions were sometimes efforts at acclimatisation and others for short-term hunting. More recently, there has been at least one accidental incursion (from a container ship in 1998) and credible reports of a concerted, malicious campaign of introduction. Hard evidence (confirmed scats, carcasses) of foxes has been found in the north-west and northern and southern midlands. Credible sighting reports have come from most of the eastern half of the State including the central highlands and the far north-west (Fox Free Tasmania 2006), mostly areas where Tasmanian Devil populations are suppressed by DFTD.<br/><br/>A commonly held view has been that the abundance of Tasmanian Devils has prevented fox establishment through interference competition, either aggressive exclusion or predation on denned juveniles (Jones <em>et al</em>. 2007). Red Foxes and Tasmanian Devils share preferences for den sites and habitat, and are of a similar size. Tasmanian Devils abundance is likely to slow, if not prevent, fox establishment. It is possible that foxes have been present in Tasmania for many decades at sub-detectable levels, and that a degree of ecological release has occurred due to DFTD, with foxes increasing to detectable numbers. The current impact of the Red Fox has been quantified (N. Mooney pers. comm.), and it is unlikely that fox numbers are currently at a level to impose a measurable impact.<br/><br/>A decline in Tasmanian Devils number may create a short to medium-term surplus of food, for example carrion; ideal for fox establishment. Fox establishment may cause both direct and indirect effects on Tasmanian Devils. Direct effects include (reciprocal) killing by then abundant foxes of then rare juvenile devils at dens while the female forages (Jones <em>et al</em>. 2007). Fox establishment may also cause ecosystem disruptions through changes in other species (Jones <em>et al</em>. 2007) - a feature of foxes on mainland Australia (e.g. Saunders <em>et al</em>. 1995) and something that might then also indirectly affect Tasmanian Devils. Tasmania has the potential to hold up to 250,000 foxes (based on modelling of habitat preferences and densities in south-east mainland Australian) which could replace most medium- to large-sized marsupial carnivores (N. Mooney unpubl.).<br/><br/><strong>Persecution</strong><br/>In the past, persecution of the Tasmanian Devil has been very high throughout settled parts of Tasmania, and is thought to have brought about very low numbers at times. Through the 1980s and 1990s, systematic poisoning in many sheep-growing areas (particularly fine-wool with its reliance on merinos) was widespread and probably killed in excess of 5000 devils per year (N. Mooney unpubl., from interviews with landowners). In the 1990s, control permits were occasionally issued to individuals who were able to argue that Tasmanian Devils were pests (e.g. killing valuable lambs).<br/><br/>Current persecution is much reduced, but can still be locally intense with in excess of 500 devils thought to be killed per year (N. Mooney pers. comm.). However, this is reducing since devil numbers have declined. While the small amount of current persecution is likely to persist it is unlikely to constitute a major threat unless the Tasmanian Devil population becomes extremely small and fragmented.<br/><br/><strong>Low genetic diversity</strong><br/>Jones <em>et al</em>. (2004) found the genetic diversity of Tasmanian Devils to be low relative to many Australian marsupials as well as placental carnivores. This was consistent with an island founder effect, but previous marked reductions in population size may also have played a role. Low genetic diversity can reduce population viability (Eldridge <em>et al</em>. 1999) and resistance to disease (Acevedo-Whitehouse <em>et al</em>. 2005).","In the early to mid-1990s, the total population estimate was 130,000–150,000 individuals (M. Jones pers. comm.; N. Mooney pers. comm.; DPIW unpubl.), based on extrapolations of population density estimates according to habitat. Systematic statewide spotlighting surveys have been carried out since 1985. Spotlighting sightings of Tasmanian Devils across the state have declined significantly since emergence of Devil Facial Tumour Disease (DFTD) in the mid-1990s: by 27% by early 2004, by 41% by early 2006, by 53% by early 2007 (Hawkins <em>et al.</em> 2006; McCallum <em>et al.</em> 2007), and by 64% by early 2008 (C. Hawkins <em>et al</em>. unpubl.). The decline was significantly sharper in regions where DFTD had been reported earliest, such that in north-east Tasmania, mean sightings have declined by 95% from 1992-1995 to 2005-2007, with no indication of recovery or plateau in decline. Comparison of mark-recapture results in the same area from the mid-1980s and 2007 supports this finding (McCallum <em>et al</em>. 2007). At the Freycinet peninsula, on the east coast of Tasmania, where the population has been monitored through trapping from 1999 to the present, the population has declined by at least 60% since the disease was first detected in 2001 and the adult population still appears to be halving annually (Lachish <em>et al</em>. 2007). Other indicators of devil abundance, such as roadkills, predation on stock, and carrion removal, also support this conclusion of a substantial decline.<br/><br/>If a 64% decline based on spotlighting surveys is applied to the population estimates from the mid-1990s, the 2007 population size would have been an estimated 25,000 mature individuals (50,000 individuals total). Another method generated an estimated total population size in 2004 of approximately 21,000 mature individuals (C. Hawkins, unpubl.). This estimate was derived from mark-recapture density estimates from ten sites (four disease-free sites, six diseased sites) in the highest density areas (north-east and south-east Tasmania) and from one disease free site outside the high density area. The population estimate at each trapping site incorporated 95% confidence intervals of +/-c. 25%. A standard buffer was placed around each trap site to calculate the area from which Tasmanian Devils are trapped during a survey, and this area varies between sites, affecting density calculations. If this estimate is of a population that had declined by 27% of the pre-disease population size, then the 2007 population (estimated to have declined by 64%) would be 10,000 mature individuals.<br/><br/>For both estimates, the potential error is high and still under discussion. The estimation of mature individuals is particularly subject to error since the disease has so reduced the proportion of older individuals: in disease-free sites, half of all individuals trapped are typically mature, but this proportion is much less in diseased sites (varying locally according to time since disease emergence). Acknowledging these provisos, the best estimate of total population size based on current evidence thus lies within the range of 10,000-25,000 mature individuals.<br/><br/>While Tasmanian Devil distribution across the state appears to be continuous, two management units have been identified, with devils in north-western Tasmania being genetically distinct from those found across the rest of the State (Jones <em>et al</em>. 2004; Farmer 2006).<br/><br/><strong>North-western</strong>. Jones <em>et al</em>. (2004) identified a genetically distinct management unit in northwestern Tasmania, across approximately 13,400 km², west of the Forth river and south to Macquarie Heads (Farmer 2006). This region encompasses four sites intensively surveyed by the Devil Disease Team since 2004, and one surveyed by C. Hawkins (unpubl.) in 2003. One of the Devil Disease Team sites, Woolnorth, holds the highest population density of Tasmanian Devils found in any of the Team's surveys, which is more than double that at the other sites. Extrapolating from the resulting density estimates, this management unit may currently consist of between 3,000 and 12,500 mature individuals. This management unit is not currently declining, but DFTD is expected to continue to spread into it.<br/><br/><strong>Eastern/South-western</strong>. The remaining 50,630 km² area covers nine sites surveyed by the Save the Tasmanian Devil Program since 2004. The mean of the density estimates for each of these sites applied to this area (separating formerly high eastern areas and from long term low density southeastern areas as described above) indicates an approximate population size of 7,000 - 12,500 mature individuals. <br/><br/>Jones and Rose (1996) related statewide survey results to environmental and climatic features, generating a CORTEX spatial model predicting distribution and relative densities across the state (Figure 1). Findings from mark-recapture trapping surveys and other trapping work by the Department of Primary Industry and Water (DPIW) Save the Tasmanian Devil Program broadly support these predictions for DFTD-free regions. However, in central and eastern regions, marked population declines have been detected, in association with the earlier reports of Devil Facial Tumour Disease (DFTD) (Hawkins <em>et al</em>. 2006; McCallum <em>et al</em>. 2007), subsequent to the time of the Jones and Rose survey. The north-west region is thus now thought to support the highest population densities.<br/><br/>The general population trend for the entire species is a decline (McCallum <em>et al</em>. 2007; Hawkins <em>et al</em>. 2006; DPIWE, 2005).",Decreasing,"The Tasmanian Devil is found throughout mainland Tasmania, Australia, an area of 64,030 km<sup>2</sup>. The species disappeared from the Australian mainland 430 +/-160 years ago (Archer and Baynes 1972), possibly through competition with dingos (Guiler 1982) and Aboriginals (Johnson and Wroe 2003). Tasmanian Devils were introduced to the small offshore Badger Island in the mid-1990s, but as of August 2007 all Tasmanian Devils were thought to have been removed from this island (N.Mooney unpubl.).<br/><br/>Tasmanian Devils were present on Bruny Island (a large inshore island off south-eastern Tasmania) in the early 1800s, but there are no confirmed records from after 1900. Tasmanian Devils also occur on Robbins Island, a large inshore island to the north-west, semi-connected to mainland Tasmania.",,Terrestrial,"As of May 2008, the Tasmanian Devil is listed as Endangered under the Tasmanian Government's <em>Threatened Species Protection Act 1995</em>. It is also listed as Vulnerable under the Australian Government <em>Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999</em>. <br/><br/>At the end of 2003, the Tasmanian State Government's Department of Primary Industries, Water and Environment (now Department of Primary Industries and Water) launched the Tasmanian Devil Disease Program to investigate and respond to the threat of Devil Facial Tumour Disease. This program, now called the <em>Save the Tasmanian Devil Program</em>, has attracted many collaborative researchers. A forum exclusive to those directly involved in DFTD research in February 2007 was attended by approximately 80 people. The mission of the Save the Tasmanian Devil Program is ""to maintain the Tasmanian Devil as an ecologically functional species in the wild"" (AUSVET 2005). Conservation actions, including research directed towards improving conservation management, are driven by three future scenarios that have the potential to turn the epidemic around and bring devils back into the landscape as an ecologically functional species (Jones <em>et al.</em> 2007). These are extinction in the wild and reintroduction, the evolution of resistance, and the broad-scale application of a vaccine. Four management actions can therefore potentially be employed: establishing insurance populations; disease suppression in wild populations; selection for disease resistance; and development of a vaccine (McCallum and Jones 2006). Each of these is included in the current Strategic Plan of the Save the Tasmanian Devil Program.<br/><br/><strong>Insurance strategy</strong><br/>The highest priority is to establish insurance populations of healthy devils in places isolated from the disease, firstly to avoid total extinction and, secondly, as a source for reintroduction to the wild if devils, and therefore also the disease, become extinct. Because these populations will possibly carry the species for 25-50 years and because devils already have low genetic diversity, a conservative retention of genetic diversity of 95% is recommended (Jones et  al. 2007; Save the Tasmanian Devil Program Insurance Population Strategy 2007). A large founder base of 150 individuals is recommended, to be built up to an effective population size of 500 individuals. This would mean maintaining an actual population size of about 1700 individuals, if they were all maintained in captivity where breeding is closely managed, or 5,000 individuals if they were all wild-living (Jones et  al. 2007; Save the Tasmanian Devil Program Insurance Population Strategy 2007). <br/><br/>Insurance populations would ideally be managed as a metapopulation of multiple captive and wild populations with managed migration between populations to maintain genetic diversity (Jones <em>et al</em>. 2007). Maintenance of wild as well as captive insurance populations is important because wild-living animals retain natural behaviours and natural suites of parasites, pathogens and commensals, all of which are progressively lost in captive animals (Jones <em>et al</em>. 2007). The options for wild insurance populations are offshore islands, and fenced enclosures on mainland Australia and disease free areas on mainland Tasmania. There are a number of issues to be considered with these possible types of insurance populations, including the number of potential sites, the number of devils that could be held, balancing the conservation value of the sites for other purposes, ecological functionality, biosecurity risk, whether the site is currently disease-free or whether disease eradication would be required (see disease suppression below), cost of establishment and maintenance, stakeholders and timescale. <br/><br/>To date, there have been three intakes of founders for captive insurance populations from the wild: 26 devils from eastern (n=13) and north-western (n=12) genetic provenances in 2005, 25 north-western founders in 2007, and 63 north-western founders in 2008. Founders were collected from as wide a geographic area as assurity of disease-free status permitted at the time (established though intensive and extensive surveys and including a buffer zone). This intake area gets smaller each year as DFTD spreads, and is currently the north-west corner and a strip down the west coast. Founder devils were accepted for collection according to a strict set of protocols: recently weaned and likely to be pre-dispersal, no biting injuries and no signs of sexual maturity / oestrus in females. The first two intakes were maintained in quarantine in Tasmania for 20 months and 8 months, respectively, in facilities where there are no wild devils on the outside (e.g. suburban, island). The current intake will be maintained in quarantine for a shorter period. These founder devils are transferred to mainland zoos where they are managed by the Australasian Regional Association of Zoological Parks and Aquariums (ARAZPA).<br/><br/>A risk reduction document has been distributed to wildlife park operators and the zoological industry (DPIW 2005; Tasmanian Devil Facial Tumour Disease Management Strategy) outlining biosecurity measures to maintain the health of current captive populations. These measures include adaptation of husbandry protocols to include use of footbaths, employ appropriate waste disposal principles or secure enclosures to prevent contact between wild and captive Tasmanian Devils. Actions have been moderately successful in terms of increasing biosecurity at existing wildlife parks. An intra-state movement guideline was established requiring special permits to transfer Tasmanian Devils between parks.<br/><br/>Updates on the disease and quarantine protocols are regularly disseminated to all stakeholders. <br/><br/><strong>Disease suppression adaptive management trial</strong><br/>The only technique currently available to manage or even eradicate the disease in wild populations is detection and removal (euthanasia) of infected individuals. This comes lower in the decision tree than establishment of insurance populations (McCallum and Jones 2006), but is also part of an insurance strategy (McCallum and Jones submitted). If this technique works, it is a means of eradicating the disease in isolatable areas. If eradication is not achievable, disease suppression is still potentially a cost-effective way of protecting wild devil populations (per devil cost per annum of A$1,000 cf. A$12,000 to maintain a devil in captivity). Disease suppression has other uses as well, such as maintaining buffer zones around fenced enclosures and eradicating incursions (McCallum and Jones submitted).<br/><br/>An adaptive management trial in disease suppression commenced in January 2006 (after an 18-month pilot study) on the Forestier peninsula, where the disease has newly arrived and prevalence was low, and where movement of diseased Tasmanian Devils across a bridge and canal can be restricted. Work is underway with the state road authority and an engineering consulting firm to construct a barrier to devils on the bridge. Diseased Tasmanian Devils are being removed from the peninsula population through intensive trapping, in the hope of reducing or extirpating the disease there and to learn more about possibilities of controlling DFTD elsewhere. If it is not possible to eradicate or even control the disease in this isolated site, it is probably not possible to do so elsewhere. The suppression has succeeded in limiting the extent of the population decline, age structure changes and geographic spread and the size of the tumours now being detected is smaller (Jones <em>et al</em>. 2007, unpubl.). In late 2006, the rate of transitions to new disease cases peaked and prevalence is now in decline (Lachish <em>et al</em>. in prep.). It is too early to say whether eradication is possible (M. Jones unpubl.).<br/><br/><strong>Selection for resistance </strong><br/>Research is in progress to identify resistant genotypes, in the MHC gene complex associated with tumour recognition (Siddle <em>et al</em>. 2007), and in the peri-centric inversion in chromosome 5 (Pearse and Swift 2006). If resistant individuals are found, management could be directed towards artificial selection in captive or wild populations, or in translocating resistant individuals to depleted parts of the devil's range.<br/><br/>Current evidence suggests that lack of diversity at the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) is responsible for the disease being able to transmit between devils (Siddle <em>et al</em>. 2007). There is evidence that some individuals from the as yet uninfected West Coast have MHC profiles that differ from those found in the infected Eastern populations (Belov pers. comm). Whether these differences are sufficient to be protective is currently unknown, but it is an area of active research.<br/><br/><strong>Vaccine and treatment research</strong><br/>Vaccine research is ongoing and potentially promising, but is expected to take many years to achieve success. To be effective for disease control in wild populations in Tasmania, much of which is rugged and inaccessible by vehicle, a vaccine would need to be orally delivered, preferably by aerial baiting.<br/><br/>Research into treatment using cytotoxic drugs is underway. Treatment could be a viable option for saving captive individuals with valuable bloodlines but is too intensive and expensive to ever be useful for conserving wild populations (Stephen Pyecroft pers. comm. in Jones <em>et al</em>. 2007).<br/><br/>Currently, approximately 40% of the state of Tasmania is protected, but this is unlikely to counter the effects of DFTD.",Australasian,,false,false,Global

In three areas where Delacour’s langur occurred in the past the species was already eradicated by the 1990s, following information provided by local people (Nadler <em>et al</em>. 2003). About half of all discovered populations (10) occurred in unprotected areas. The protection level in protected areas is mostly low, but still under control of the Forest Protection Department.

The distribution of animals within subpopulations during this period indicates a reduction in the occurrence of larger populations compared to the previous decade (Nadler 2004; 2015). During this decade a number of small populations were eradicated. The exact years of extirpation cannot be verified. The information is based on interview surveys of local villagers, who indicated that the last sighting or record of the species was often several years ago.

The distribution of subpopulations and smaller social groups is closely related to the series of limestone mountain ranges in the provinces of Ninh Binh, Nam Ha, Hoa Binh, and Thanh Hoa (Nadler <em>et al.</em> 2003, 2004, 2015; Nadler and Brockman 2014). The area of occupancy (AOO) for this species prior to 2000 was only about 400 km² but with eradication of several populations the AOO is currently smaller than 300 km² (Nadler 2015).","The species is hunted primarily for the purposes of traditional ""medicine"", but also for food and occasionally for the pet trade.",Terrestrial,"<p><span class=""None"">This species is currently listed in CITES Appendix II. It is considered 'critically endangered' in Viet Nam, and is listed under the highest protection level in Decree 32/2006, and as species for special conservation considerations in Decree 160/2013. It occurs in six protected areas. Van Long Nature Reserve was established for conservation of this species in 2001, and there has been evidence of population growth in this reserve in the past 15 years.<br/><br/>The primary focus of conservation activities for the species should be the protection of all remaining populations. But this is far from the reality. The protection of areas without current protection status - which are three areas - is not feasible. To apply for a protection status and establish strong protection for an area is not a viable option for such extremely small populations with little chance of ever developing into viable populations. These populations will be eradicated and disappear in the near future. The most efficient option to stabilize the largest existing population in Van Long Nature reserve and to save sufficient habitat for the long-term existence of a viable population would be the extension of the reserve. <br/><br/>Translocation of isolated groups of animals or small populations from areas under pressure or for improving the genetic pool of a larger population is undoubtedly an important conservation tool for many species. The most critical point is the method with which to catch the animals in the areas which are often very difficult to access. One way is netting of the animals in a cave, a sleeping place which the animals occasionally or preferentially use in the winter season. Special caves and cracks in the limestone outcrops are often used consistently by generations of animals in one group. But groups which use easily accessible caves are as a consequence of easy access, are already wiped out by hunters and the remaining sleeping places are very difficult to access. Currently, there is no other proven technique for capturing animals in the difficult terrain that constitutes their natural habitat. A well-trained team with substantial financial and technical support would be necessary to develop a technique to safely capture animals in the wild.<br/><br/>A basis for reintroduction is the captive population of Delacour’s langur at the Endangered Primate Rescue Center. In 2011 a first pilot project was conducted with the reintroduction of three captive born individuals into Van Long Nature Reserve (Agmen 2014, Nadler 2012). Based on the successful result a second reintroduction took place in November 2012, also in Van Long Nature Reserve (Elser 2013, Elser <em>et al.</em> 2015). The programs have been very positively received by villagers and the awareness about protection of the species in the communes surrounding the nature reserve is very high. This has resulted in the long-term success of the Frankfurt Zoological Society conservation project and the strong involvement of local villagers and guards of the community protection unit in protection and conservation activities (Elser and Nguyen Hong Chung 2013).<span class=""None""><br/><br/>From a conservation point of view, the establishment of a second population would be a preferable option in order to secure the long-term existence of the species.

The caves found in this habitat are thought to offer protection from predators and temperature extremes but, if accessible to people, this habitat is also where human hunters capture or kill sleeping Langurs (Nadler <em>et al</em>., 2003). It is arboreal and terrestrial, and diurnal and mildly crepuscular. Like other Langurs, this species is mainly folivorous, with leaves making up between 75-87% of its diet; the rest is composed of fruit, flowers, and stems (Hendershott <em>et al.,</em>&#160;in prep.). Forty-two families of plants with 98 plant species have been reported to constitute their diet. Social composition is unimale-multifemale groups with and, despite the small number of animals remaining, bachelor bands composed of several males have been identified (Luu Tuong Bach and Le Van Dung, 2013).

Reproductively valuable males were often the most common victims due to their behavior (Stenke and Chu Xuan Canh, 2004).&#160;This is highly questionable, however,&#160;as their behaviour is not enormously different and, if anything, females would be easier to hunt as they are often grouped together and there are more of them per group (Leonard Neahga in litt., 31 October 2019).<br/><br/>Hunting for meat seems to have happened rarely due to the reputed poor taste of langur meat.<br/><br/>Habitat disturbance and fragmentation resulting from the growing human population on Cat Ba Island (due in large part to the country's designation of the island as a new tourism center for northern Viet Nam), and rampant fires due to honey collectors (Nadler and Long, 2000) are also threats.<br/><br/>Poorly regulated tourism in the inadequately managed Cat Ba National Park has direct effects on langur natural history, such as the disturbance to habitat in the karst archipelago where these monkeys live. The small size and fragmented nature of the remaining Cat Ba Langur population means that the species is at risk of inbreeding effects (or intrinsic effects to avoid inbreeding by not breeding at all), extremely limited mate-choice due to the small number of available females, and the chance of a natural or human disaster causing total or effective extinction. However, according to&#160;Leonard Neahga (in litt., 31 October 2019) the population would have been very small even at its peak, and would have been small for the last 12,000 years when the langurs were confined to Cat Ba as a result of rising sea levels. It is unlikely that the population was ever above 4-5,000 individuals at any point over the last 12,000 years.&#160;This suggests that major inbreeding effects would have already happened in the deep past and, potentially, been weeded out.&#160;The threat of disease remains a major concern.<br/><br/>The presence of a group of non-native macaques on a nearby tourist island that have extensive daily contact with humans is a cause for concern due to the potential of escape and disease transmission. &#160;</p>","<p><span class=""None"">The confirmed population of <em>Trachypithecus poliocephalus</em> in June 2016 was 51-54 individuals (30-35 mature individuals), a sharp drop from was 64-70 as of November 2015 (CBLCP unpublished information).&#160;<span class=""None"">As of this update the reason for this drop appears to have been poaching by people from the neighbouring province (Neahga Leonard in litt., 31 October 2019).&#160;Previously published population numbers contain errors and a reevaluation of observation records indicates that in 2000 the population totalled between 40 and 53 animals.

The Cua Dong population was most at risk with a 40.5% risk of extinction at the worst case scenario over 100 years. The low reproductive rate and low carrying capacity of the site increase the probability of extinction. The captive population ran a very high extinction risk of 100% in the worst case and 95% in the best case (or ‘optimistic’) over 50 years, owing to the susceptibility of the population to inbreeding and due to small population size.<br/><br/>Births per year have been steadily increasing, with approximately 30% of the reproductively active females giving birth per year from 2014 until present (2019) except for 2016.

It disappeared from northern and western parts of Bohemia, and much of Poland where 87% of the hibernating population was lost between 1950 and 1990 (Urbanczyk 1994, Ohlendorf 1997). In Switzerland and Austria the distribution became fragmented, as colonies remained only in higher elevations (&gt;400 m) (Stutz and Haffner 1984, Spitzenberger 2002), although in Switzerland the population has started to recover slowly over the last 10 years (increasing from 2,200 to 2,500 adults counted in maternity roosts: H.

Although there have been marked and well-documented declines in some areas, the species remains widespread, abundant, and apparently stable in other areas. Assessed as Least Concern.","It forages in pastures, deciduous temperate woodland, Mediterranean and sub-mediterranean shrubland and woodland. Important foraging habitat and landscape features includes woodland, particularly early in the year, and permanent summer-grazed pasture, particularly late in the summer. It feeds on beetles, moths and other insects at low level in pastures and in trees up to 2 to 3 km from the roost each night (by aerial hawking or perch feeding). Summer roosts are located in warm natural and artificial underground sites, and attics in the northern part of the range. The species will use caves all year, but particularly in northern Europe it uses buildings for summer maternity colonies. Where the species occupies buildings, it requires particular features of the building itself, as well as proximity to good foraging areas and underground sites for torpor at various times of year and for winter hibernation (Hutson <em>et al.</em> 2001). In winter it hibernates in cold underground sites (usually large caves). The requirements for hibernation appear to be within limited confines of temperature and humidity, but vary with age, sex and condition. The mean temperatures in spring, at the end of hibernation, may influence the time of birth at the summer maternity colonies; late parturition in turn increases mortality rates of juveniles (Hutson <em>et al.</em> 2001). In southern parts of the range, they are active all year-round. A sedentary species, distances of 20-30 km between winter and summer roosts are typical (longest distance recorded 180 km: de Paz <em>et al.</em> 1986).<br/><br/>In South Asia, this species is found in montane forests among the mountains and valleys of the Himalaya. It is gregarious and roosts in caves, old temples, old and ruined buildings in tight clusters. It has a slow and fluttering flight and feeds on small insects, lacewings, small moths, spiders and grasshoppers. A single young is born after a gestation period of 72 days (Bates and Harrison 1997).","The main threats are fragmentation and isolation of habitats, change of management regime of deciduous forests and agricultural areas, loss of insects due to pesticide use, and disturbance and loss of underground habitats and attics. In northwest Europe, habitat change is likely to have been amongst the major causes of declines, the conversion of woodland and small-field landscape to large-scale agricultural land being particularly damaging. While declines elsewhere, particularly in eastern Europe, may currently not be so marked, the loss of cultural landscapes in those countries as they move towards western-style economies may have significant effects in the near future. The use of pesticides has been a recognized threat to the insect food, particularly where these have been directed against the larvae of favoured food items, such as melolonthid beetles, larvae of noctuid moths or crane-flies. Favoured prey may be affected secondarily by pesticide use, such as the loss of dung fauna from the use of persistent anti-parasitic drugs (avermectins) on cattle. Populations in caves and other underground habitats have suffered from increased disturbance (for example by tourist visits to caves). In buildings, colonies may be affected by human intolerance, renovation work or the application of pesticides, such as some of those used for the remedial treatment of timbers (Hutson <em>et al.</em> 2001).<br/><br/>In South Asia, this species is threatened by deforestation, generally resulting from logging operations and the conversion of land for agricultural and other uses. Disturbance to roosting sites is likely to be a potential threat to the populations of this species (Molur <em>et al.</em> 2002).","It is an infrequent species in most parts of its range, although in at least parts of south-west Asia and the Caucasus it is abundant and widespread (it is the most frequently reported species in Turkey: A. Karatash pers. comm. 2005), with populations in Iran and Turkey considered to be stable (A. Karatash, M. Sharifi and K. Tsytsulina pers. comm. 2005), although it may be decreasing in Russian parts of the Caucasus (S. Kruskop pers. comm. 2005).

However, there are signs of stabilization and/or recovery in some northwest European countries (Hutson <em>et al</em> 2001). For example, in the UK the species declined massively in the past but it is now stable at a low population level (around 5,000 individuals) (Ransome and Hutson 2000). However, in Austria declines continue, with population reductions of 70% in the last 10 years (from 100 to 30 breeding individuals: Spitzenberger 2002, F. Spitzenberger pers. comm. 2006). In other parts of Europe, trends vary and are generally less well known: in Malta the species has become extinct, in Portugal and Spain the trend is not known (although some colonies have disappeared in Spain) (Palomo and Gisbert 2002, Cabral <em>et al.</em> 2005)&#160;, while it is currently considered extinct in Gibraltar&#160;(S.

They are most common in evergreen forests in the warmer months (Kunz and Martin 1982). Female bats usually only have one young a year (Tuttle 1988). The newborns range in weight from 2.1-2.7 g. There is a strong maternal bond and the young bats squawk when the mother is away. The young bats, however, grow quickly, being able to fly within three weeks. After two months, many of the young bats have left the nursery roosts, with male bats leaving before female. In their first year, male bats are almost certainly incapable of breeding while female bats are able to reproduce at the age of four months (Barbourand Davis 1969).<br/>These animals are sensitive to light and movement so if they are disturbed during the day, they awake and their ears begin to move as they try to identify the intruder. If the disturbance occurs for more than a few seconds, the entire group takes flight (Barbour and Davis 1969). Mating usually occurs in two phases. In the summer phase, both partners are alert and active, in a time known as the active phase. During the winter, or the passive phase, the females are torpid and the males seek out and find these females and mate with them. The females remain inattentive throughout the entire encounter (Fenton 1985). These bats are insectivorous. They to emerge late in the day to feed (Barbour and Davis 1969). Townsend's Big-eared Bats feed on small moths and either capture these moths from leaves or catch them directly in the air along forested edges (Kunz and Martin 1982).-","This species has declined due to direct killing by people and because of abandonment of roosts caused by disturbance due to explorers and vandals.

As of 2005, the species had been recorded from 18 counties in Tennessee (Tennessee Bat Working Group).<br/><br/>Several occurrences are known from state or national parks, including the largest known hibernating colony and some large (&gt;100 individuals) maternity colonies in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. Two large hibernating colonies in the Great Smoky Mountain National Park are partially protected, one with a gate and the other with fencing. Additional protected occurrences include (but are not limited to) the following. One protected colony occurs in Carter Cave, Kentucky. A colony also occurs in Natural Bridge State Park in Kentucky. Sites on USFS property are required under NEPA to be considered when evaluating effects of management practices. One large maternity colony is within Mammoth Caves National Park. Arkansas has gated several caves with <em>Myotis sodalis</em> colonies, and these may also be potential roost sites for Rafinesque's long-eared bats (Harvey 1992). Two maternity colonies in old buildings in Illinois have been protected, and the buildings repaired to extend their useful life (Gardner 1992).<br/>This is a bat of forested regions. Hibernation in the north and in mountainous regions most often occurs in caves or similar sites; small caves are selected, and the bats stay near the entrance (often within 30 meters) and are thought to move about in winter (Handley 1959, Barbour and Davis 1969). Winter habitat in the south is poorly known, but usually this species is not found in caves during winter. In the Coastal Plain they are suspected to use hollow trees for cold weather and possibly winter roosts. In the southern portions of the range these bats often roost in buildings year round. Summer roosts often are in hollow trees, occasionally under loose bark, or in abandoned buildings in or near wooded areas. Nursery colonies are rare in caves, but are known to occur in Kentucky and Tennessee (Barbour and Davis 1969). A large nursery colony (87 adults in June of 1985) roosts in abandoned copper mines in Great Smoky Mountains National Park (Currie 1992). <br/><br/>In Louisiana, Gooding and Langford (2004) found that roost trees were hollow <em>Nyssa aquatica</em> with triangular-shaped basal openings, and all were located within a 5-hectare tupelo stand.  In Mississippi, Trousdale and Beckett (2005) found that tree roosts were in hollow <em>Nyssa</em> spp. and <em>Magnolia grandiflora</em>. Most of the trees were still alive, relatively large, and were adjacent to streams or other bodies of water. Tree roosts were apparently rare within the study area, and <em>C. rafinesquii</em> showed roost fidelity to particular areas of forest. Six tree roosts were used by multiple individuals and several trees were reused within tracking sessions and among years.<br/><br/>In Louisiana, Lance <em>et al.</em> (2001) demonstrated that bridges, especially girder bridges, are important day-roost sites. Tagged bats in this study roosted under bridges 50% of the time and in black gum trees (<em>Nyssa aquatica</em>) 50% of the time. In Mississippi, small groups of females (mean of 5.6 adult females) used concrete bridges as maternity roosts; the bridges were much less used in fall and winter (Trousdale and Beckett 2004). It has been suggested that the species began using man-made structures in the coastal plain region only after large old hollow trees became scarce.<br/><br/>In Arkansas these bats are found in cisterns and wells rather than caves (Harvey 1992). In the mountains of South Carolina they roost in rock houses, abandoned gold mines, and hollow trees. In the coastal plain of North Carolina, they move into old buildings in the summer. They are known to use hollow trees as temporary night roosts between feeding bouts in the summer. In central Florida, a maternity roost was in an abandoned trailer that had been placed on a site in the early 1980s; it had been occupied for several years by the mid-1990s (Finn 1996). <br/><br/>Dilapidated buildings are inhabited more commonly than are intact occupied structures, and Clark (1987) reported that these bats roost in the darkest parts of such buildings. Others have reported that these bats choose more open and lighted daytime roosts than other kinds of bats (Handley 1959, Barbour and Davis 1969, Harvey 1992). Clark (1987) agreed that in caves and mines this species prefers areas receiving some natural light. The foraging habitat is primarily mature forest in both upland and lowland areas. In North Carolina and Virginia, foraging habitat for subspecies <em>Macrotis </em>is mature hardwood floodplain forest; sites along permanent water bodies, especially rivers, are preferred (Clark 1987). In the Upper Coastal Plain of South Carolina, where large contiguous tracts of mature bottomland hardwoods were common, most foraging activity of males nevertheless occurred in young pine stands; only 9% of foraging areas were in bottomland hardwoods (Menzel <em>et al</em>. 2001).","Much historically occupied habitat was lost with the clearing of swampland forests. Present threats include: forest destruction (significant in parts of coastal plain); hollow tree removal during certain forest management practices (widespread; noted in Mississippi as important); decreasing availability of abandoned buildings through razing and vandalism (serious threat in coastal plain); insecticide applications, at least in past; vandalism of caves and mines, and closing or blasting mines shut (England <em>et al.</em> 1992). There is considerable potential for loss and degradation of roosting and foraging habitats by commercial logging practices in preferred habitat (Schmidly 2004).<br/><br/>This species is very intolerant of disturbance (natural or human) and may abandon roost sites or hibernation sites if subjected to disturbance. Disturbance in winter may arouse bats and cause them to use up fat needed to survive the winter (Harvey 1992). Tendency to roost in cave entrances makes this bat especially vulnerable to disturbance. One roost site was abandoned after the surrounding area was logged.","Population size is not known to exceed 10,000 mature individuals, but data are lacking for many areas. This bat never has been considered abundant. In general, it roosts in small numbers at scattered locations (e.g., in Alabama, the largest known colony includes only a few individuals). Population is thought to be 1,000-2,000 in each of Kentucky and South Carolina. This is one of the most common bats in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park; hibernation roosts include up to several hundred individuals (e.g., in 1993, two roosts included 454 and 699 bats); Harvey (1991) reported a hibernating colony of 570 individuals as well as smaller maternity roosts. In a cave in Kentucky, counts of hibernating <em>C. rafinesquii</em> ranged from 14-49, with summer colony size reaching a maximum of 118 bats (Hurst and Lacki 1999). In southern Mississippi, the number of bats present under occupied bridges ranged from 1 to 25 per bridge (Trousdale and Beckett 2004). In Florida, this bat is uncommon in the northern part of the state and rare in the south (Florida Bat Center, www.floridabats.org). In Georgia, it is widespread but rare (Georgia Wildlife Web). In much of the range thorough searches have not been completed and abundance is poorly known.<br/><br/>No range-wide statistics on trends are available, but four states (Georgia, West Virginia, South Carolina, and Tennessee) reported documented population declines, and populations in Indiana and Ohio probably have been extirpated. Four other states (Alabama, Arkansas, Illinois, and North Carolina) reported suspected declines.

In most other states, data are unavailable to determine trends.",Increasing,"The range extends from southern Virginia, West Virginia, Ohio (Handley 1991), Indiana, and Illinois south to Florida (primarily the panhandle and northern and central portions of the peninsula) and the Gulf of Mexico; west to Louisiana, Arkansas (known primarily from the Gulf Coastal Plain), eastern Oklahoma, and the eastern edge of Texas (Schmidly 2004) (Whitaker and Hamilton 1998; Lynch and Jones, in Wilson and Ruff 1999).

Abandoned buildings should be searched as potential roost sites (Finn 1996).<br/>Protect all colony sites with more than 10 bats present. Foraging habitat may be critical to species survival and should therefore be protected (protect mature floodplain and swamp forests; maintain large hollow tree component of such forests). Abandoned-building roost sites should be protected or, if need be, replaced with a potential alternate roost area on the site (Finn 1996).&#160;More accurate information is needed on general biology, foraging habitat, foraging behavior, and the importance of mature forests, hollow trees for roosts, and small maternity colonies.",Nearctic,,false,false,Global

Females frequent more roost site than males, making associations in many different places. The associations between females are maintained over many years. Wilkinson (1985, 1986) reported that although self-grooming occurs more often, social grooming is an important part of the Common Vampire Bat's behaviour. Social grooming usually occurs between females and their offspring, but it is also significant between adult females. The adult females participating in grooming are usually closely related or roost mates. Wilkinson (1986) found that social grooming has more to do with food sharing than with the removal of ectoparasites. In many instances, social grooming begins with one female approaching another and grooming her for as long as two minutes.

It has been noted to shelter in caves. It feeds on columnar cacti when it is in bloom. Pregnant females were captured in September.

Over the last three generations (18 years) a population decline of almost 10% is estimated (R. Medellin pers. comm.), but it is not sufficient to include the species under a threatened category. However, its area of occupancy is less than 500 km² and the continuing decline of habitat quality stays at values of round 10% over most of its geographic range. These conditions lead the species to being listed in the Near Threatened category, as it is close to qualifying as Endangered based on criterion B2b(iii).","This species occurs in thorn scrub and deciduous forest. Its range corresponds closely to the distribution of the mezcal plant (<em>Agave angustifolia</em>) in Mexico (Arita 1991). This bat roosts in caves and mines, often in colonies of several thousand. It emerges about an hour after sunset to feed on nectar and pollen of agaves and saguaro cactus in Arizona. It lands on the flowers or may hover for short periods to feed. Plant species visited in central Mexico are similar to those for <em>Leptonycteris nivalis</em>. Some fruit and insects are also taken. Night roosts, including buildings, are used after feeding (Reid 1997). Northern subpopulations migrate south in September and return in May. Young of these migratory subpopulations are born in May to June in large maternity colonies (Barbour and Davis 1969). An additional&#160;subpopulation&#160;is non-migratory&#160;and remains year-round in the tropical dry forest regions of central and western Mexico. In these subpopulations, young are born in December and January.<br/><br/>Number of subpopulations and population size are likely stable or declining at a rate of less than 10% over the last three generations (18 years). In recent years 13 roosts across Mexico had stable or growing populations, including one roost with over 100,000 bats.&#160;The habitat in Mexico is primarily tropical deciduous forest and thorn forest (Arita 1991) as well as Sonoran desert. In the United States, this bat roosts in old mines and caves at the base of mountains near alluvial fans vegetated with agave, yucca, saguaro and organ pipe cactus (Barbour and Davis 1969). Young are born in maternity colonies in caves and mines.","Previous surveys (USFWS 1988, 1995) stated that the species was threatened by disturbance of roosts, loss of food sources through land clearing and human exploitation, and direct killing by humans. Habitat loss in caves, used for mining and recreation, remains an issue.","It is generally uncommon (Reid 1997). This species is represented by a large number of occurrences or subpopulations. Arita (1991) mapped well over 100 collection sites in Mexico. Arita and Humphrey (1988) reported 269 historical and currently occupied localities in Mexico. Total adult population size is unknown but exceeds 100,000. A single roost in northern Mexico supports probably more than 100,000 individuals. This species is widespread and abundant in Mexico (Arita and Santos-del-Prado 1999). See Cockrum and Petryszyn (1991) for historical and recent population estimates for several sites in Arizona (no decline is evident) and Sonora.<br/><br/>Cockrum and Petryszyn (1991) strongly disputed the reported decline of this species and, in reviewing pertinent data, concluded that little evidence exists to document a long-term decline in Arizona, New Mexico and Sonora. These authors stated ""the various recent reports of disappearance appear to be, at least in part, the result of not looking in the right places at the right times"" and further reported that ""current populations...are little, if any, decreased from those of a quarter century ago.

It mainly adopts a fly-catching tactic by  hanging from tree branches that are at a certain distance from paths and  the understory (Lee <em>et al.</em> 2012). In Kenting, southern Taiwan,  it feeds on insects at least from eight orders, with beetles and moths  accounting for over 60% of the relative importance (Lee <em>et al.</em>  2005, YF Lee, pers. data). In central Taiwan, lesser insect orders were  detected in the diet, but beetles and moths were still the most  important food items, accounting for over 95% in Lienhuachih, whereas  beetles alone accounted for over 90% (Lu 2013). It is a cave-dwelling  species and has been found roosting in limestone caves, clefts,  abandoned tunnels and buildings, as well as underground irrigation  channels (Lee <em>et al.</em> 2007, Cheng <em>et al.</em> 2015). During the breeding  season, adult bats were often found solitarily in a single roost but  occasionally observed in a small group consisting of up to 3 individuals  (Lee and Huang 2006), females have high fidelity to their maternal  roosts. The mating system is suggested to be facultative  monogamy/polygyny (H.-Y. Yu 2015). In Kenting, female pregnancy became  apparent between mid-April and mid-May while female lactation was also  observable starting in early April and lasting till early June. Females  have high fidelity to their maternal roosts and some individuals have  been observed using the same breeding roosts for six years (Yu 2015).  Volant juveniles appear in mid-late July (YF Lee, pers. data).  Individuals in hibernation and deep torpor have been recorded in caves  in high mountains. However, it displays no true hibernation in lower  elevation, but the activity dwindled in the cooler and windy months  roughly from November to February (Lee <em>et al.</em> 2007, H.-Y.

It occurs in a variety of wooded habitats including especially ponderosa pine forest, pinyon-juniper woodland, riparian woodland, encinal (oak woodland), pine-oak woodland, and fir forest. Others come from more arid habitats, including desert shrub, mesquite grassland with scattered oaks, xeric scrub, and tropical deciduous forest. The species is a highly adapted insect predator using a sophisticated combination of sonar signals and flight maneuvers to forage for and intercept its nocturnal prey. It feeds on small moths; other known prey include soldier beetles, dung beetles, leaf beetles, roaches, and flying ants (Wilson and Ruff 1999).<br/>Habitat is primarily mountainous wooded areas (e.g., ponderosa pine, pinyon-juniper, Mexican woodland, oak brsuh) but also includes riparian (e.g., cottonwood) woodland and ranges from Mohave desert scrub of low desert ranges to white fir forest (Hoffmeister 1986). Typically this bat is found near rocks: cliffs, boulders, lava flows, etc., and it is frequently netted along streams or over ponds. Maternity colonies of 30 to 150 individuals have been found in mine shafts, boulder piles, sandstone crevices, lava beds, and beneath the loose bark of large ponderosa pine snags (Bat Conservation International, Western Bat Working Group, Czaplewski 1983, Rabe <em>et al.</em> 1998, Adams 2003).","Extent of occurrence, area of occupancy, number of subpopulations, and population size apparently have declined but probably at a rate of less than 10% over 10 years or three generations.&#160;Threats include recreational entry into occupied caves/mines, active mining in occupied tunnels, vandalism or closure of abandoned mines used as maternity roosts, and timber management practices that reduce the availability of large pine snags for roosting. The Western Bat Working Group categorized the threat as ""High"" throughout the Rocky Mountain region (Adams 2003). The Arizona and Nevada natural heritage programs considered the degree of threat to be moderate (Sabra Schwartz and Carrie Carreno pers. comm., 1998). Lack of adequate information for Mexican populations prevents range-wide assessment of the scope of threat. An important mine roost was destroyed by relocation of a nearby highway (Adams 2003).  Maternity colonies are easily disturbed, often resulting in abandonment (Arizona Game and Fish Department 1997). Limited data suggest that this bat may abandon mines that have been gated to prevent recreational entry, even if the gates are permeable to other bat species (Western Bat Working Group).","The species is uncommon in USA (Wilson and Ruff 1999), where it is represented by several dozen occurrences or subpopulations.

This species is  found in a variety of habitats ranging from tropical moist forest to  urban environments. Roosts have been predominantly found in caves and  abandoned buildings (e.g., forts and houses as well as water tunnels,  Kumar <em>et al.</em> 2015, Sharma <em>et al.</em> 2020). It feeds on fruit  (e.g., <em>Ficus </em>spp., <em>Musa </em>sp., flowers and leaves, Vanhalnghaka 2015).  Additionally, it has been shown to occasionally feed on small fish  (Ghose and Chosal 1984).

It is not believed to be declining fast enough to qualify for listing in a threatened category, although in some regions it has undergone significant declines due to hunting, cave disturbances, treasure hunting, and persecution as the species is considered a pest and harms crops.","This is a colonial species which forms colonies ranging in size from  tens of individuals to ca. 1.8 million bats (Carpenter <em>et al. </em>2014).  The roosts are in caves, rock crevices, and old tombs and can be found  in a wide variety of habitats including secondary forest, agricultural  areas, and other disturbed areas like rural gardens, fruit orchards and  at the forest edge (Heaney <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1991, 1998, Heideman and Heaney 1989, Lepiten 1995, Rickart <em><em>et al.</em></em>  1993). It is present, but less common, in primary tropical moist  forest. Preliminary evidence from pollination studies suggests this  species may play an important role as a pollinator for commercially  important durian trees, Parkia speciosa Hassk, and cultivated banana  (Musa spp.) (Sritongchuay and Bumrungsri 2016, Bumrungsri <em><em>et al.</em></em>  2013). They have been documented traveling up to 50 kilometers each  night, in search of appropriate fruit (Whittaker, 1994). Gestation is  thought to be about 150 days, and lactation about 60 days (Heideman and  Utzurrum 2003). The species may have two litters of a single young  annually (Bonaccorso 1998, Heideman and Utzurrum 2003) or just two  well-defined clusters per year, one in March/April and the other in  August/September (Heideman and Utzurrum 2003). Rousettus are known to  use a primitive form of echolocation (tongue clicking) while foraging.<br/><br/>Deforestation, which is severe in the Philippines (Jones <em><em>et al.</em></em>  2009), limits vegetative cover. This results in patchy distribution of  food resources and has the potential to destroy important navigational  landmarks (Mickleburgh <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2002). Cave disturbances,  resulting from activities such as guano mining and visitation by  tourists and treasure hunters, renders otherwise suitable caves  unsuitable for habitation, limiting an already finite resource for the  bats (Mickleburgh <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2002, Jones <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2009). Climate change has the potential to alter existing vegetative communities (Hughes <em><em>et al.</em></em>  2012) and generate more severe weather systems, causing increased bat  mortality (Wiles and Brooke 2009). In the Philippines and Indochina,  they are subject to intense hunting at some cave roosts (Utzurrum 1992).  Finally, predation by invasive predators, like feral cats and dogs, and  humans who harvest bats for bushmeat, sport, medicine, and trade place  <em>R. amplexicaudatus</em> under even greater levels of strain (Mickleburgh <em><em>et al.</em></em>  2002, Wiles and Brooke 2009). In some locations, the disturbances  caused by these various threats have been so severe that the species has  completely abandoned many of its historic roosts (Carpenter <em><em>et al.</em></em>  2014). In some areas people still net around their orchards and the bat  will get caught and die in the nets. <em>Rousettus amplexicaudatus</em> are one  of the most common bats found in these nets (P. Soisook pers. comm).","It is predicted by experts that the population is declining due to  habitat destruction, deforestation (fragmentation, forest conversion to  urban areas and plantation agriculture), karst and cave disturbances  (tourism), mining, treasure hunting, bat hunting, introduction of  invasive predators, and overharvesting by humans throughout its range  (Heaney <em>et al.</em> 1991, 1998; Heideman and Heaney 1989; Lepiten 1995; Rickart <em>et al.</em> 1993; Mickleburgh <em>et al.</em> 2002; Wiles and Brooke 2009; Furey <em>et al.</em>  2016). Further, it is regarded as a pest in some parts of its range and  in some areas, people still net around their orchards, leaving the bats  to die in the nets. Rousettus amplexicaudatus are one of the most  common bats found in these nets (S. Bumrungsri Pers. comm. 2019).","The global population of <em>Rousettus amplexicaudatus</em> is thought to be  declining due to extensive disturbance in its roosts from hunting,  mining and other threats (see below). However, this is a widespread  species that is commonly encountered. It is a common species with an  extensive geographic range. This is a locally abundant species in  Southeast Asia and the Philippines (Utzurrum 1992). The Monfort Bat  Cave, on Samal Island in the southern Philippines has an estimated 1.8  million individuals (Carpenter <em>et al.</em> 2014) and is formally  recognized as the world’s largest colony for the species. Many colonies  throughout its range are subject to intense hunting (Utzurrum 1992,  Scheffers <em>et al.</em> 2012), and anthropogenic pressures at cave  roosts have resulted in the abandonment of many historically occupied  sites (Carpenter <em>et al.</em> 2014). Despite the broad distribution of  R. amplexicaudatus and the perception that it is quite common, this  species is subject to many threats throughout its range (Delpopolo <em>et al.</em>  2014). Scientists are concerned that the presence of multiple large  roosts masks, or may cause biologists to overlook, critical signs of  stress, such as regular roost abandonment (Delpopolo <em>et al.</em> 2014).<br/><br/>Within  some countries, biologists believe that the species is in decline due  to habitat destruction (deforestation, karst and cave disturbance) and  hunting (Indonesia, S.

However, conservation of the species remains  challenging given its extensive range, diverse habitats, and  perceptions of local communities. Further, conservation efforts for the  species are difficult because many perceive that this is a common  species with few threats due to the massive numbers that are readily  seen when the species is in a roost (Carpenter <em>et al.</em> 2014).<br/><br/>Identification,  protection, and regular monitoring of important roost sites would  benefit the conservation of this species across its range. The united  protection of local and regional cave roosts for the species also will  help to ensure the sustainability of regional populations. In the  Philippines, caves are protected under the Cave Management Act, although  this is not fully enforced. In much of Southeast Asia the species  requires protection from hunting. The more people know about the natural  history of&#160;<em>R. amplexicaudatus</em>, the more effectively populations can be  monitored, managed, and protected (Delpopolo <em>et al.</em> 2014).  Conservation campaigns will increase the awareness of people about this  species conservation, and afterwards it is hoped that cave disturbance  and hunting activities can be minimized. Research and education are  needed about the species actual impact on orchards and how helpful and  crucial they really are to economically and ecologically important  species and crops (C.

Few colonies are known to biologists even in areas with extensive underground cavities (MacKinnon <em>et al.</em> 2003, Kofoky <em>et al.</em> 2007) suggesting that they have specific roosting requirements (Andrianaivoarivelo <em>et al.</em> 2011a). It is also recorded from a number of locations that are without known roosts or caves (Andriafidison <em>et al.</em>  2006, Rakotoarivelo and Randrianandriananina 2007, Rakotonandrasana and  Goodman 2007) and it may therefore roost in other sites such as tree  holes.<br/><br/>Although it is widely distributed it appears to be associated with forests (MacKinnon <em>et al.</em> 2003), is able to fly within relatively intact forest (Kofoky <em>et al.</em> 2007) and has been trapped inside <em>Eucalyptus plantations</em> (Randrianandriananina <em>et al.</em> 2006), in agricultural settings (Andrianaivoarivelo <em>et al.</em> 2011b, Randrianandriananina <em>et al.</em> 2006, Kofoky <em>et al.</em> 2007, Rakotoarivelo and Randrianandriananina 2007, Ralisata 2014) and in villages (Andriafidison <em>et al.</em> 2006).<br/>There  have been several dietary studies. It feed on the fruit of endemic  forest trees (Razafindrakoto 2006). Nectar appears to be an important  dietary constituent and bats have been observed feeding on banana and  kapok flowers (Andrianaivoarivelo <em>et al.</em> 2011b, Andriafidison <em>et al.</em> 2006). In the Maromizha forest in eastern Madagascar, Andrianaivoarivelo <em>et al.</em>  (2011b) found relatively few seeds (several <em>Ficus species</em>, <em>Dypsi </em>ssp  and <em>Rubus mollucanus</em>) in the faeces and inferred that <em>R.  madagascariensi</em>s fed also on nectar, flowers, leaves and fruit with  seeds too large to swallow. Flight cage experiments by  Andrianaivoarivelo <em>et al.</em>, (2102b) revealed that it preferred  native or introduced fruit of no commercial value (<em>F. polita</em>, <em>Syzigium  jambos</em> and <em>S. malaccense</em>) to commercial species (<em>Litchi chinensis</em> and  <em>Diospyros kaki</em>). In similar experiments, bats were offered <em>F.  sakalavarum </em>and <em>Ziziphus jujube</em>. Juveniles fed extensively on the former  while adults preferred unripe <em>Ziziphus</em>, whose seeds are too large to  swallow. It was concluded that <em>R. madagascariensis</em> is an effective  disperser of <em>F. sakalavaru</em>m particularly for isolated trees or those in  forest fragments where other frugivores are rare (Andrianaivoarivelo <em>et al.</em> 2012a).<br/><em><br/>Rousettus  madagascariensis </em>feeds especially on autochthonous or introduced plant  species which grow inside or outside the natural forest ecosystems  (Andrianaivoarivelo <em>et al.</em> 2012a, Andrianaivoarivelo <em>et al.</em> 2011b, Andriafidison <em>et al.</em>  2006). It appears to have no predators when foraging, but the barn owl  (<em>Tyto alba</em>) is a predator at roost sites (Goodman and Griffiths 2006).  Its feeding behavior seems to be well adapted to the anthropogenic  changes of the environment and it contributes to the dispersion of  forest seeds (Andrianaivoarivelo <em>et al.</em> 2011b).<br/><br/>The  morphometric variations of this species are associated with sexual  dimorphism and with geographical and altitudinal locations. The body  mass also varies with food availability which in turns depends on  season. However there was contrast between the morphometric and genetic  diversities. Populations sampled at low altitude and in the North have a  longer forearm and lower body mass than those at higher altitude, in  the South and East of Madagascar. However, molecular genetic studies of  samples from throughout Madagascar showed that there was no genetic  variations between populations and the species has a panmictic structure  (Andrianaivoarivelo 2012, Goodman <em>et al.</em> 2010). The lactation  period coincides with the rainy season and weaning is completed by the  end of the rain period. The growth of young bats takes place during the  dry season and somatic growth is completed within a year  (Andrianaivoarivelo 2012).","Although Goodman <em>et al.</em> (2005) suggested that <em>Rousettus madagascariensis </em> is not dependent on relatively intact forest, the extent to which the  destruction and degradation of natural forest threatens this species is  not clear. Recent research demonstrated that the removal of forest cover  in the east led the bats to abandon their roosts (Andrianaivoarivelo<em> et al.</em>  2011a). Some colonies are located away from intact forest and  additional study is therefore needed on the mobility of this species.  The main threats to <em>R. madagascariensis</em> are to its roosts where it is  subject to hunting pressure (Golden 2005, 2009; Jenkins <em>et al.</em>  2007; Rakotonandrasana and Goodman 2007; Jenkins and Racey 2008) in  virtually all sites that are not inside protected areas (Goodman <em>et al.</em>  2005) or considered sacred (Rakotoarivelo and Randrianandriananina  2007). It appears to be hunted exclusively for subsistence and bats are  harvested using locally made traps as well as being knocked down from  the cave ceiling with wooden batons (Andrianaivoarivelo <em>et al.</em>  2011a, Rakotonandrasana and Goodman 2007). On Ile Sainte Marie the  reported offtake was between 360 and 480 bats per year (Rakotonandrasana  and Goodman 2007).","It roosts in aggregations of over a thousand individuals (MacKinnon <em>et al.</em> 2003, Rakotoarivelo and Randrianandriananina 2007) but smaller colonies of a few hundred are also known (Andrianaivoarivelo <em>et al.</em> 2011a, Jenkins <em>et al.</em> 2007, Kofoky <em>et al.</em>  2007). It can be locally abundant and is often the most commonly  trapped species in mist-netting surveys in the west of Madagascar  (Kofoky <em>et al.</em> 2007, Rakotoarivelo and Randrianandriananina 2007) and in the southeast (Ralisata 2014).",Decreasing,"This species is endemic to Madagascar and the adjacent islands Nosy Be,  Nosy Komba and Sainte Marie. It is generally widespread but rare or  absent from the central highlands and the arid south-west (MacKinnon <em>et al.</em> 2003, Goodman <em>et al.</em> 2005).","It appears to be hunted exclusively for subsistence and bats are harvested using locally made traps as well as being knocked down from the cave ceiling with wooden batons (Andrianaivoarivelo<em> et al. </em>2011a, Rakotonandrasana and Goodman 2007).",Terrestrial,"As a game species under Malagasy law (Durbin 2007), <em>R. madagascariensis</em>  is only protected when it occurs in nature reserves. In a survey of  western Madagascar it was found in six protected areas: Parcs National  d’Ankarana, Ankarafantsika, Namoroka, Tsingy de Bemaraha, Isalo and  Réserve Spéciale d’Analamerana (Goodman <em>et al.</em> 2005).

Under natural conditions, the brown flower bat roosts in the cooler hot-chamber foyers (Rodríguez-Durán 2009). It begins foraging later than many other bats (Gannon <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2005). Its diet typically contains some combination of insects, nectar, and fruit. In a detailed survey, 75% of the individuals consumed at least some insect remains, 76% had fed on nectar, 85% had eaten fruit, and about half the bats had consumed all three dietary items during their most recent foraging period (Soto-Centeno 2004). Seeds found in fecal pellets indicate that it often feeds on the fruit of Panama berry, elder, and turkey berry, whereas pollen samples obtained from the fur suggest that this bat also visits flowers of banana, guava, and wild tamarind for nectar (Gannon <em>et al</em>. 2005). It has a litter size of one and probably gives birth just once each year in spring. On Puerto Rico, pregnant females can be recorded from February through June, and lactating females from May through September (Gannon <em>et al</em>. 2005).","In the Neotropics, caves are under particular threat from increasing numbers of visitors who damage or modify the structure of the caves by mining for construction material or through extraction of guano for fertilizer (Mancina <em>et al</em>. 2007).

It is a high and fast flyer that feeds on insects and other invertebrates.","In South Asia, the habitat of this species is being deforested for  timber, firewood and conversion to agricultural use. It is also  threatened due to extraction and mining activities (Molur <em>et al.</em>  2002). In mainland Southeast Asia, a colony of 300,000 bats was  destroyed in northern Myanmar as a result of limestone extraction for  cement manufacture (P. Bates pers. comm.), and a colony of hundreds of  thousands of bats was eradicated as pests in Phnom Pehn, Cambodia (P.  Bates pers. comm. 2006). In the Philippines, this was formerly among the  most abundant bats in some large caves. However, virtually all of the  known large colonies have now been extirpated, including the loss of a  very large colony from Leyte in 1984 (L. Heaney pers. comm. 2006). The  remaining population is probably declining due to forest loss,  disturbance in caves (guano mining, hunting), and tourism (Heaney <em>et al.</em> 1998).

The  only other member of the genus is the smaller bat <em>N. neocaledonica</em> from  New Caledonia. Unlike all other bats in the Pteropodidae family, bats in  the Notopteris genus have long tails extending past the wing membrane  (i.e. free-tailed).<br/><br/>In Fiji <em>N. macdonaldi </em>is recorded from the three  largest islands, Viti Levu, Vanua Levu, and Taveuni, but its cave sites  are seemingly restricted to Viti Levu (Flannery 1995, Palmeirim <em>et al.</em> 2005, Palmeirim <em>et al.</em> 2007, Scanlon 2009, Scanlon <em>et al.</em>  2014a). Considered abundant in 1978 (Pernetta and Watling 1978), they  occupy a broad range of habitats in Fiji, including lowland forest,  intermediate altitude vegetation, and mossy montane forest, as well as  patchy secondary forest and rural gardens (Pernetta and Watling 1978,  Mickleburgh <em>et al.</em>1992, Flannery 1995, Palmeirim <em>et al.</em> 2005, Scanlon <em>et al.</em>  2014a). Recapture data show that individuals make habitual nightly  movements and are faithful to particular forest areas (Scanlon and  Petit, 2015). They often forage together in pairs or small groups,  comprising an adult with younger animals, they reproduce year round  (Scanlon <em>et al.</em> 2014a, Scanlon and Petit 2015).<br/><br/>Their diet comprises pollen and nectar, and they are probably important pollinators of forest plants (Scanlon <em>et al.</em>  2014b). Being small (adult mass: 50–90 g) and manoeuvrable, they  readily navigate through cluttered understory forest to access floral  resources. Little information is available on their habitat or ecology  on Vanuatu.","It is not known to be exploited in Vanuatu, and the threats there are  poorly known. However, this species is vulnerable to direct exploitation  and potential disturbance at roosting sites by vandalism, guano mining,  recreation, and quarrying (Mickleburgh <em>et al.</em> 1992). Large numbers of bats are taken from at least one cave in Fiji with shotguns for consumption (Palmeirim <em>et al.</em> 2005). Tourism is a potential threat to nursery colonies in at least two of the four known maternity caves of Fiji (Palmeirim <em>et al.</em>  2005). A quarry has now been established in the immediate vicinity of  one cave (Wailotua) and blasting of rocks there likely threatens the  adjacent cave and bats (Scanlon 2009). Two of the four caves also occur  in highly urbanised areas near the capital city of Suva, increasing  levels of pollution, invasive species and disturbance there threatens  the bats and their cave habitats.","This bat is projected to be declining across its range. Fiji likely  holds more than half of the global total and is present on the three  main Fijian islands (Flannery 1995, Palmeirim <em>et al.</em> 2007, Scanlon <em>et al.</em>  2014a). However, the only known breeding caves (four in total) are all  on Viti Levu, which has a favourable geology with some limestone caves.  Individuals on Vanua Levu and Taveuni may migrate to the nurseries on  Viti Levu, which is within their range of movement. Bats netted shortly  after dusk on Vanua Levu indicate that cave roosts may also occur there  (Scanlon <em>et al.</em> 2014a).

These threats are expected to continue.","This bat is usually found roosting in rock fissures and caves (MacKinnon <em>et al.</em>  2003) although it may also roost in tree foliage. In the Ankarana  National Park it often roosted in high points near the large entrances  of long caves with a high buffering capacity for temperature and  relative humidity (Cardiff 2006). The species' patchy distribution,  which includes humid, dry deciduous and spiny forest, is probably  related to the availability of suitable roost sites and <em>E. dupreanum</em> is  rare or absent from a number of forests without rocky outcrops (Goodman <em>et al.</em> 2005, Schmid and Alonso 2005, Jenkins <em>et al.</em>  2007). Although it continues to survive in highly modified landscapes with very  little native vegetation remaining (Ratrimomanarivo 2007), it appears  to use native forest vegetation for food in preference to introduced  plants (Picot <em>et al.</em> 2007).<br/><br/>Fruit is the main dietary component but it also eats leaves and other plant parts (Picot 2005, Picot <em>et al.</em>  2007). Through the ingestion of nectar and small seeds, a significant  role in pollination and seed dispersal is inferred (Picot <em>et al.</em>  2007, Ratrimomanarivo 2007). Plants are often found growing out of the  faeces beneath rock crevices occupied by <em>E. dupreanum</em> (P.A. Racey,  unpublished), which is also an important pollinator of threatened baobab  trees (Baum 1995, Andriafidison <em>et al.</em> 2006).<br/><br/>MacKinnon <em>et al.</em>  (2003) suggested that <em>E. dupreanum </em>might be migratory (like its  congener in Africa, Richter and Cumming, 2008) because of regular  variation in the occupancy and abundance of roosts. Antibodies to Nipah,  Hendra, and Lagos Bat viruses, and isolates of other viruses were  detected in<em> E. dupreanum </em>at several sites in Madasgascar (Iehlé <em>et al.</em> 2007, Razafindratsimandresy <em>et al.</em> 2009, Reynes <em>et al.</em> 2011). Additional research is needed on natural history and in particular roosting ecology and movements.","This species is hunted for bushmeat across its range both at roosting  and foraging sites (Jenkins and Racey 2008, Randrianandrianina <em>et al.</em>  2010). Four out of nine <em>Eidolon dupreanum</em> roost sites in and around the Parc  National d'Ankarana showed evidence of hunting (Cardiff <em>et al.</em>  2009). It is classed as a game species under Malagasy law and although  it can only be legally hunted between May and August (Durbin 2007), this  legislation is widely ignored and the bats are hunted throughout the  year. Its roosts tend to be well protected from bushfires and it is able  to survive in landscapes with severely depleted natural food supplies  as long as alternative plants are available (Ratrimomanarivo 2007).  Since forest loss affects food availability (Picot <em>et al.</em> 2007) and may affect accessibility of roosts for hunting (Cardiff <em>et al.</em> 2009), deforestation and hunting are the main threats. Hunting accounted for a 30% desertion rate from 60 roosts (MacKinnon <em>et al.</em>  2003). Although hunters report that deserted roosts are recolonized  after a few years, there are several confirmed examples where this  species has been extirpated at roost sites (MacKinnon <em>et al.</em> 2003).","The species' global population is suspected to have declined by 30% over the last three generations (generation length = 6 years; Pacifici <em>et al</em>. 2013) due to intense hunting, and the disturbance and loss of important roost sites. Estimates of colony size are difficult to obtain because the bats  are often difficult to observe in their day roosts, but is usually in  the range of 10–500 bats, with a median of 200 individuals (MacKinnon <em>et al.</em>  2003).

Declining of population is expected at the global scale.  In Taiwan, decreasing gene flows among geographic populations with  increasing geographic distance were reported (Fang and Cheng 2011),  suggesting the species is a poor disperser.

Light pollution might be  also a threat since individuals are observed avoiding artificial light  by cave entrance (Huang, J. C.-C., pers. obs.). In South Asia, some  populations are threatened by deforestation, generally resulting from  logging operations and the conversion of land to agriculture and  settlements especially in the Indian northeast (Molur <em>et al.</em>  2002).

The species is only known from three (3) disjunct sites (2 locations) on Negros and Cebu Islands; its AOO is 40-56 km². Its range is severely fragmented and the presumed extant subpopulations are estimated at 40-50 mature each, and likely much fewer. Historic hunting, and the past and ongoing forest loss, degradation, and fragmentation caused a past population decline by more than 80% resulting in the species previously being considered extinct as it had not been seen since 1964 (Heaney <em>et al.</em> 2008).

Currently, extant subpopulations of fewer than 50 mature individuals are thought to persist in remnant patches of secondary forest on karst limestone on both Negros (Alcala et al. 2004) and Cebu (Paguntalan <em>et al</em>. 2004) where the natural vegetation on steep slopes can include batino (<em>Alstonia macrophylla</em>), hindunganon (<em>Macaranga</em> sp.), tubug (<em>Ficus septica</em>) and matamban (<em>Mallotus</em> sp.)

The surrounding agricultural clearings are typically planted with abacca (<em>Musa textiles</em>), gabi (<em>Colocasia esculenta</em>) and coconuts (<em>Cocos nucifera</em>) (Paguntalan <em>et al.</em> 2004). The forest patch remnants at Carmen and Catmon (Cebu Island) and Calatong (southern Negros Island), are likely critically important sites for the species. Unfortunately, the available forest habitat for the species quite limited (Alcala <em>et al.</em> 2004), especially on Cebu where the series of small secondary-growth forest fragments on limestone are highly disturbed (Paguntalan <em>et al</em>. 2004).<br/> <br/> Records suggest that the species is likely a cave obligate dweller (Rabor 1986, Heaney and Heideman 1987, Utzurrum 1992) and likely roosts in caves (or large cracks) in limestone and forages in karst-forest habitats (Heaney<em> et al. </em>1998, Paguntalan<em> et al. </em>2004), which have less rainfall than in other parts of the country. However, three individuals were collected roosting in coconut fronds (Rabor 1954), suggesting that <em>D. chapmani</em> may be more flexible in some of its foraging and roosting habits and may be able to use of degraded and highly disturbed habitats (Paguntalan <em>et al</em>. 2004).

Important cave roosts of the species, including vulnerable maternity colonies, have been and continue to be heavily disturbed or destroyed throughout the Philippines through guano mining, treasure hunting, and mining of the limestone in which the caves exist. Further, bats are presumed to be heavily hunted in the cave roosts (Gonzalez <em>et al</em>. 2018). The species is also assessed as Vulnerable under the Philippines Red List (Gonzalez <em>et al.</em> 2018) as critical lowland forest have been reduced to less than 8% of its original extent (<em>ca</em> 2% old growth, 6% secondary) (Walpole 2010).","<em>The habitat requirement</em><em>s</em><em> of</em><em> Eonycteris robusta</em>&#160;are not well-known, but the species appears to be reliant on caves in lowland forest habitats. It is most common in undisturbed forest though it can occur in secondary forest and some disturbed areas. It is thought to roost primarily in caves, although it is possible that rock crevices and rocky banks along creeks are also used as roosting sites in primary lowland forest and disturbed habitats on limestone on Negros (E. Alcala pers. comm. 2006); there are no reports from agricultural or urban areas. Its critical lowland forests have been reduced to ca. 2% old growth and 6% secondary forests remaining (Walpole 2010). Cave roosts continue to be heavily disturbed or destroyed throughout the Philippines through guano mining, treasure hunting, and mining of the limestone in which the caves exist (N.

Previously, habitat loss was very high throughout much of the Philippines and the species may be less threatened currently than it was 20 years ago simply due to the limited amount of lowland forests remaining (<em>ca</em> 8%; Walpole 2010; L.

Despite large population size and good recovery, the species is regarded as being vulnerable to potential massive mortality from white-nose syndrome. Considering a time period of three generations (30 years), including   both past (12 years) and future (18 years), this species is likely to decline   by more than 30% across its geographic range. The expansion of WNS in eastern North America is threatening several species, like <em>Myotis grisescens</em>, causing that the species may reach the criteria for Vulnerable, considering that previous to 1990's the declining in the population was larger than 50%, and the current scenarios are not favourable for many of these populations.","About 95% of entire known population hibernates in nine caves, over half in one cave. Roost sites are nearly exclusively restricted to caves throughout the year (Hall and Wilson 1966, Tuttle 1976), though only a few percent of available caves are suitable (Tuttle 1979). They are known to migrate up to 300 miles between summer and winter caves. Winter roosts are in deep vertical caves with domed halls. Large summer colonies utilize caves that trap warm air and provide restricted rooms or domed ceilings, maternity caves often have a stream flowing through them and are separate from the caves used in summer by males. Occasionally non-cave roost sites are used. There are occasional reports of mines (Sealander 1979, Brack <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1984, Harvey and McDaniel 1988) and buildings (Gunier and Elder 1971) being used as roost sites. Winter caves are deep and vertical and provide a large volume of air below the lowest entrance that acts as a cold air trap (Tuttle 1976). Cold air flows in and is trapped during successive winters, providing mean annual temperatures 6 °C or more below the above-ground mean annual temperature; winter cave temperatures range from 6 to 11°C (Tuttle 1976, 1979). In the summer, maternity colonies prefer caves that act as warm air traps or that provide restricted rooms or domed ceilings that are capable of trapping the combined body heat from thousands of clustered individuals (Wilson and Ruff 1999). Hibernation sites often have multiple entrances, good air flow, and temperatures of approximately 5-9 C, though 1-4 C may be preferred (Tuttle and Kennedy 2005).<br/><br/>Undisturbed summer colonies may contain up to 250,000 bats, and average 10,000 to 25,000 (Tuttle 1979). Summer caves are nearly always located within 1 km of a river or reservoir over which the bats forage (Tuttle 1979). Tuttle (1979) showed that forested areas along the banks of streams and lakes provide important protection for adults and young, which take shelter in forest areas near the entrance to cave roosts. These bats do most of their foraging over water, and are know to eat mayflies and other aquatic insects (Wilson and Ruff 1999), however, they do not feed in areas along rivers or reservoirs where the forest has been cleared (LaVal <em>et al</em>. 1977). Yearlings and adult males segregate into nomadic summer colonies that tend to roost in caves within a few kilometers of ones selected by adult females (Layne 1978, Wilson and Ruff 1999).","Populations of the Gray Myotis have declined by at least 50% from the 1960s to the early 1980s (Brady <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1982, Wilson and Ruff 1999). The number of occupied caves has substantially decreased. In Missouri, 26 of 66 caves used historically by this species and surveyed in 1994 showed no evidence of recent use, a similar decline has occurred in Florida (Layne 1978).&#160;Decline began with cave disturbance associated with saltpeter production during the Civil War. Some of the largest colonies were lost as a result of cave commercialization. Some caves were improperly gated. Cave disturbance has been the major factor in the decline. Cave protection efforts have greatly reduced this threat. The species is especially vulnerable due to its high fidelity to particular favored caves, which meet very specific roosting requirements, therefore, they are very sensitive to disturbance, including the mere presence of humans with lights, disturbance may result in bats moving to less favourable roosting places (Tuttle and Kennedy 2005).<br/><br/>White-nose Syndome (WNS) has already killed roughly six million bats having spread over two thousand kilometres within North America, and most of its impact is on eastern populations of bats, like <em>Myotis grisescens</em> (Alves <em>et al</em>. 2014). This disease is considered as one of the major threats to populations of this species.<br/><br/> Habitat loss and degradation and contamination from pesticides also are considered a cause of decline. Natural flooding and impoundment of waterways has resulted in temporary impacts to some caves and the complete submersion and loss of other important cave sites. The use of forestry insecticides and crop pesticides in areas adjacent to riparian corridors where gray bats forage may reduce the prey base or kill bats that ingest contaminated insects (Northern Prairie Wildlife Research Center). Some maternity and hibernating colonies are susceptible to human disturbance (Northern Prairie Wildlife Research Center).","Total population was estimated at 1.6 million in the late 1990s (Wilson and Ruff 1999). About 10,000 are thought to occur in Florida in summer, a few hundred in winter (Humphrey 1992).&#160;Maternity colonies include from a few hundred to many thousands of individuals. Five gated maternity caves in Oklahoma each include 10,000 or 20,000 bats (Hensley 2003). Gray Bats have such specific cave requirements that fewer than five percent of caves are suitable.  It is estimated that 90 percent of the species' range-wide population hibernates in only nine caves (USFWS 2009). Its populations had declined about 50% between 1965 and 1999. Since listing as Endangered by the US (in 1976), several critical hibernation caves have been gated, leading to stable and growing population in many areas. These combined conservation measures have slowed the prior rate of decline. However, the impact of the White-nose syndrome on its populations could lead them to a more critical situation (Alves <em>et al</em>. 2014), and the species is under continuous monitoring by the US Fish and Wildlife Service.",Increasing,"The Gray Bat (<em>Myotis grisescens</em>) occurs in the south-central and southeastern United States. Its range extends from southeastern Kansas and central Oklahoma east to western Virginia and western North Carolina, and from Missouri, Illinois, and Indiana south to southern Alabama and northwestern Florida (Decher and Choate 1995), occurs primarily in the cave region of Missouri, Arkansas, Kentucky, Tennessee, and Alabama (Wilson and Ruff 1999). Summer and winter ranges are essentially the same.",,Terrestrial,"Cave protection efforts have led to recent population increases. By 1991, the range-wide population was stable and perhaps growing, apparently due to successful cave protection efforts. Since 1981, the maternity colony population in Oklahoma has increased from 56,000 to almost 150,000 (Hensley 2003). The recovery plan criteria for change from endangered status to threatened status is documentation of permanent protection of 90% of Priority 1 hibernacula and documentation of stable or increasing populations at 75% of Priority 1 maternity caves during a period of five years; recent studies indicate that these criteria have been met (Harvey and Currie 2002).<br/><br/>The Tennessee Valley Authority sponsored a recovery project that resulted in the protection of two critical maternity sites: the Hambrick and Nickajack caves in Tennessee. Blowing Wind Cave in northern Alabama, the most important summer cave known for gray bats, has been acquired by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and a gate has been placed across the entrance. Fern Cave, the largest known gray bat hibernaculum, has also been purchased by the Fish and Wildlife Service and is being managed for protection of the bats. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service also has acquired and protects additional caves in Alabama. To protect habitat, The Nature Conservancy has established six voluntary protection agreements with private landowners for gray bat maternity sites. The National Park Service restricts human access to six Gray Bat maternity caves on its lands and monitors them for possible disturbance. The Indiana Bat and Gray Bat Comprehensive Plan contains a detailed list of caves that have been protected or are currently being managed.<br/><br/>Identify all caves used for different stages of the life history. Occupied caves should be protected from human disturbance. A buffer of undisturbed vegetation should be left around the entrances of caves inhabited by gray bats; wooded travel corridors between roosting and foraging sites should be protected; the use of herbicides and pesticides in areas adjacent to foraging and roost sites should be carefully controlled and monitored for unanticipated adverse effects (Alabama Forestry Commission).",Nearctic,,false,false,Global

Consequently it is assessed as Least Concern.","Maternity colonies roost in tree hollows, spaces under the loose bark  and bat-boxes, crevices in buildings and bridges, frequently in cattle  stables as well as in hollow blocks. The colony usually consists of  30-80 individuals. In buildings, however, they can also be more numerous  (up to 200 females). As many other woodland bats, it is prone to  frequent change of roosts (1-2 times a week). Male colonies of up to 30  animals also occupy tree cavities, bat and bird boxes and buildings. It  hibernates in underground habitats (caves, cellars and mines), usually  solitary or in small clusters of 2-5 individuals (Simon <em>et al.</em>  2012). The best known hibernation site is Nietoperek fortification  system in Poland with more than 300 recorded hibernating bats (EUROBATS  2019).<br/>It hunts over a variety of habitats such as meadows, pastures,  orchards, broadleaved woods, open coniferous forests and riparian  areas. Intense foraging was observed inside cattle sheds. Feeding areas  range between 128 and 580 ha. The core of a feeding area can be up to 4  km away from the roost and individuals are faithful to them, returning  there regularly. Commuting routes between the roost and the core area  are also utilised for foraging. In a German study, the average distance  between maternity roosts and feeding areas was 1.5 km.M. nattereri can  capture prey on the wing and by gleaning resting insects from the  surface of vegetation using the tail membrane and/or feet. The chief  components of its diet are Diptera and Coleoptera, especially Brachycera  and Curculionidae. Diurnally active insects, insects which rarely fly  and non-flying arthropods are also eaten (see the literature review in  Kyheröinen <em>et al.</em> 2019). Faecal pellets collected at a  hibernation site in southern England for two winters, indicated that <em>M.  nattereri</em> forages throughout winter on non-volant Aranea, Isopoda and  Lepidoptera (Hope <em>et al.</em> 2014). Movements between summer, autumn  and winter roosts up to 185 km were recorded (Schober, Grimmberger  1998). The maximum known longevity for males and females was 21,5 and  17,5 years respectively (Ohlendorf 2002, Topal 2011).","Major threats in Europe are as follow (Simon <em>et al.</em> 2012):  Habitat and roost loss due to abandonment of cattle husbandry (stable  housing). Enlargement of crops leading to the destruction of  small-scale, insect-rich cultivated landscapes. Insect loss due to the  intensive agriculture, forestry and use of pesticides, also in livestock  farming. Reduction of summer and winter roosts' availability due to  forest operations (removal of deadwood and old trees with cavities),  renovation of buildings, bridges, cattle stables etc. Disappearance of  small waters in the forest and in the country. Loss of hibernacula due  to collapse, closing or conversion of e.g. ice cellars, bunkers and  other underground habitats.Disturbances (noise, vandalism) in the winter  quarters.The species is sensitive to light pollution (Voigt <em>et al.</em> 2018). It is exposed to a high risk of collisions with vehicles (Fensome, Mathews 2016).","<em>M. nattereri </em>is widespread in Europe, but the population trend is uncertain.

Among major range states outside the EU, Moldova and Belarus reported negative population trends (Moldova 2018, Shpak 2018), whereas it is rather stable in Ukraine (Ukraine 2018) and Russia (S. Gazaryan, pers. comm.). In Norway, it hasn't been found since 2010 despite special efforts (Henriksen, Hilmo 2015). According to the combined prototype European hibernating bat indicator (Haysom et al. 2013), a moderate increasing trend was observed.",Stable,"Taxonomic position of <em>M. nattereri&#160;</em>is not completely resolved, because it was split off to a complex of segregate species.&#160;A series of genetic surveys focusing on Western European populations showed the existence of at least five major mitochondrial lineages which may represent separate species. Three of those lineages were located in continental Europe, one in Corsica and the another one in Northwestern Africa. The linage restricted to Iberia and the Balearic Islands was erected as a distinct species <em>M. escalerai </em>(Ibáñez <em>et al</em>., 2006, Salicini <em>et al. </em>2011). Lately, bats which inhabit mountain areas of provinces of central and northern Spain, southern France, the Italian Peninsula, adjacent southwestern parts of Austria and&#160;marginal areas to the north and west of the Alps&#160;were assigned to the new taxon <em>Myotis crypticus</em>. Another cryptic species&#160;<em>Myotis zenatius</em>&#160;is probably endemic and occurs in the Mediterranean region of Morocco and Algeria, and possibly Tunisia (Juste <em>et al.</em> 2019).

22053184,14136,Myotis sodalis,Near Threatened,,2016,2016-01-07 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<span lang=""EN-US"">The species has a wide range, however its area of occupancy (AOO) is small and near 100 km<sup>2</sup>, based on hibernacula that contain the vast majority of the population (NatureServe 2016). The most significant range wide threats to the species have traditionally been habitat loss/degradation, forest fragmentation, winter disturbance, and environmental contaminants (USFWS 2009). The greatest single cause of conversion of forests within the range of the species is urbanization and development (USFWS 2007). In addition to these threats, the white-nose syndrome caused by the fungus <em>Geomyces destructans</em> affects hibernating individuals in caves through eastern United States (Thogmartin <em>et al.</em> 2012, Powers <em>et al.</em> 2015). In the 2008, a decline has been calculated to be more than 50% over the last 10 years (Clawson 2004). However, recent population estimates show a stationary condition between 1983 and 2005 (0.5% mean annual change, 95% confidence interval [CI] = -2.8, +1.8%) (Thogmartin <em>et al.</em> 2012). Nevertheless, populations continue to decrease in several portions of their range, and given its small AOO the species is listed as Near Threatened based on B2b(iii).","This species is represented by many maternity occurrences and hibernacula, but the majority of the population hibernates at relatively few sites, including several caves and one mine in Missouri, southern Indiana, and Kentucky (Brady <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1983, USFWS 1999). About 85% of the total population hibernates in nine Priority 1 caves, which contain at least 30,000 bats, the remaining 15 percent of the population have been or currently are distributed among 50+ Priority II and III hibernacula (Menzel <em>et al</em>. 2001). About ninety wintering sites are known.<br/><br/>Maternity colonies consist of small, widely scattered colonies of females (rarely more than 100) and their young. These are more widely distributed and numerous than are major hibernacula. For example, individuals from one hibernaculum in New York used many roost trees (Britzke <em>et al</em>. 2006). Captures of reproductively active females or juveniles at 24 sites in 16 counties in Illinois indicate that maternity colonies of this species occur throughout the range of this species in that state (Gardner <em>et al</em>. 1996). Maternity sites have been found in 13 counties in Kentucky (Kentucky Bat Working Group, http://www.biology.eku.edu/bats/indianabat.htm).<br/><br/><em>Myotis sodalis</em> hibernates in caves, maternity sites generally are behind loose bark of dead or dying trees or in tree cavities (Menzel <em>et al</em>. 2001). Foraging habitats riparian areas, upland forests, ponds, and fields (Menzel <em>et al</em>. 2001), but forested landscapes are the most important habitat in agricultural landscapes (Menzel <em>et al</em>. 2005).<br/><br/>In hibernation, limestone caves with pools are preferred. Hall (1962) noted that preferred caves are of medium size with large, shallow passageways. Roosts usually are in the coldest part of the cave. Preferred sites have a mean midwinter air temperature of 4-8 C (tolerates much broader range) (Hall 1962, Henshaw and Folk 1966), well below that of caves that are not chosen (Clawson <em>et al</em>. 1980). Roost sites within caves may shift such that bats remain in the coldest area (Clawson <em>et al</em>. 1980), individuals may move from a location deeper in the cave to a site nearer the entrance as the cold season progresses, they may move away from areas that go below freezing. Hibernation in the coldest parts of the cave ensures a sufficiently low metabolic rate so that the fat reserves last through the six-month hibernation period (Henshaw and Folk 1966, Humphrey 1978). Relative humidity in occupied caves ranges from 66 to 95% and averages 87% throughout the year (Barbour and Davis 1969, Clawson <em>et al</em>. 1980). Because of these requirements, <em>M. sodalis</em> is highly selective of hibernacula.<br/><br/>During the fall, when these bats swarm and mate at their hibernacula, males roost in trees nearby during the day and fly to the cave during the night. In Kentucky, Kiser and Elliott (1996) found males roosting primarily in dead trees on upper slopes and ridgetops within 2.4 km of their hibernaculum. During September in West Virginia, males roosted within 5.6 km in trees near ridgetops, and often switched roost trees from day to day (C. Stihler, West Virginia Division of Natural Resources, pers. observ., October 1996, cited in USFWS 1999). Fall roost trees tend to be in sunnier areas rather than being shaded (J. MacGregor, pers. observ., October 1996, cited in USFWS 1999). In summer, habitat consists of wooded or semiwooded areas, often but not always along streams. Solitary females or small maternity colonies bear their offspring in hollow trees or under loose bark of living or dead trees (Humphrey <em>et al</em>. 1977, Garner and Gardner 1992). Humphrey <em>et al</em>. (1977) determined that dead trees are preferred roost sites and that trees standing in sunny openings are attractive because the air spaces and crevices under the bark are warmer. In Illinois, Garner and Gardner (1992) found that typical roosts were beneath the exfoliating bark of dead trees, other roost sites were beneath the bark of living trees and in cavities of dead trees. Kurta <em>et al</em>. (1993) found a large maternity colony in a dead, hollow, barkless, unshaded sycamore tree in a pasture in Illinois. In Michigan, a reproductively active colony occupied eight different roost trees (all green ash), all of which were exposed to direct sunlight throughout the day, bats roosted beneath loose bark of dead trees (Kurta <em>et al</em>. 1993). In western Virginia, a male used a mature, live, shagbark hickry tree as a diurnal roost, the bat foraged primarily among tree canopies of an 80-year-old oak-hickory forest (Hobson and Holland 1995). In Missouri, primary maternity roosts were in standing dead trees exposed to direct sunlight, there were 1-3 primary roosts per colony, alternate roosts were in living and dead trees that typically were within the shaded forest interior (Callahan <em>et al</em>. 1997). See Garner and Garner (1992) for detailed information on summer habitat in Illinois. Though maternity sites have been reported as occurring mainly in riparian and floodplain forests (Humphrey <em>et al</em>. 1977, Garner and Gardner 1992), recent studies indicate that upland habitats are used by maternity colonies much more extensively than previously reported. Garner and Gardner (1992) reported that 38 of 51 roost trees in Illinois occurred in uplands and 13 trees were in floodplains. Of the 47 trees in forested habitat, 27 were in areas having a closed (80-100%) canopy, and 15 were in areas having an intermediate (30-80%) canopy. A single roost tree was found in the following types of habitat: a heavily grazed ridgetop pasture with a few scattered dead trees, a partially wooded swine feedlot, a palustrine wetland with emergent vegetation, a forested island in the Mississippi river, and a clearcut around a segment of an intermittent stream where dead trees were retained for wildlife. Roosts were not found in forests with open canopies (10-30%) or in old fields with less than or equal to 10% canopy cover. In eastern Tennessee and western North Carolina, several maternity colonies were in sun-exposed conifer snags (roost sites were above the surrounding canopy), some of these snags fell and were not used in subsequent years (Britzke <em>et al</em>. 2003). Rarely maternity colonies have been found in crevices in utility poles or in bat boxes (e.g., Ritzi <em>et al</em>. 2005). See Menzel <em>et al</em>. (2001) for a review of forest habitat relationships. Known roost tree species include elm, oak, beech, hickory, maple, ash, sassafras, birch, sycamore, locust, aspen, cottonwood, pine, and hemlock (Cope <em>et al</em>. 1974, Humphrey <em>et al</em>. 1977, Garner and Gardner 1992, Britzke <em>et al</em>. 2003, Britzke <em>et al</em>. 2006), especially trees with exfoliating bark.<br/><br/>In Illinois, Indiana bats used the same, evidently traditional, roost sites in successive summers. Recapture of the same individuals within traditional roost sites during subsequent summers suggests site fidelity (Garner and Gardner 1992, Gardner <em>et al</em>. 1996). Relatively few individuals roost in caves at the mouths of which late summer swarming occurs (Cope and Humphrey 1977, Barbour and Davis 1969).","A significant threat is human disturbance at winter caves, which causes aroused bats to deplete energy reserves (Mohr 1972, Engel <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 1976). Handling of hibernating bats by researchers may result in the bats moving to the use of less suitable hibernacula, causing additional loss of fat reserves (Jones 1971 in Engel <em>et al</em>. 1976). In southern Indiana, Johnson <em>et al</em>. (1998) found that populations subject to high human visitation experienced increased weight loss in winter, but populations in each of two disturbed hibernacula increased in abundance, suggesting that ""<em>M. sodalis</em> is affected by limiting factors other than, or in addition to, human visitation in winter"". Vandalism and indiscriminate killing have been a problem at some caves. Commercialization of caves may result in excessive disturbance (Mohr 1972) or intentional elimination by cave owners (Hall 1962). Other threats include exclusion of bats by poorly designed gates (as formerly at Long's Cave in Mammoth Cave National Park, Kentucky), changes in cave temperatures induced by opening additional entrances (Matthews and Moseley 1990) or poorly designed barriers to human access (Richter <em>et al</em>. 1993). Improperly constructed gates can alter the air flow, trap debris, and block the entrance by not allowing enough flight space (Brady <em>et al</em>. 1982). Altered exchange of air with the outside environment can cause significant changes in cave temperature and humidity (Currie pers. comm., 1992) and may cause the bats to abandon the cave. Improperly constructed gates may also subject the bats to severe predation as they attempt to pass through the gates (Tuttle 1977). Despite protection at overwintering sites, populations continue to decrease in several portions of their range, suggesting that the species is being negatively affected by disturbance or loss of summer habitat. Loss and degradation of summer habitat and roost sites due to impoundment, stream channelization, housing development, clearcutting for agricultural use (Herkert 1992), or incompatible forest management practices that result in a shortage of the microhabitats used for maternity roosts may be the primary factors in recent population declines (Gardner pers. comm., 1992, Refsnider pers. comm. 1992, Currie pers. comm. 1992, see also Sparks <em>et al</em>. 2005, NatureServe 2016).The most recent threat to this and other cave bats is the white-nose syndrome caused by the fungus&#160;<em>Geomyces destructans</em>&#160;that affects hibernating individuals in caves through eastern United States (Thogmartin <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2012, Powers <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2015).&#160; White-nose syndrome is having an appreciable influence on the status and trends of Indiana bat populations, stalling and in some cases reversing population gains made in recent years.","Total known population at major hibernacula was about 883,720 in 1960/1970, 679,170 around 1980, 473,970 around 1990, and 387,300 in 2003 (Clawson 2004). Census data from 1995-1997 indicate an abundance decline of about 60 percent since population surveys began in the 1960s, the most severe declines have occurred in Kentucky and Missouri, where the decline totals 430,000 individuals over the past few decades (Federal Register, 9 April 1999). In Indiana, bat numbers in 2001 appeared to be stable to slightly increasing. In Kentucky, their numbers appeared to be declining, but not so rapidly as in Missouri, where between 1975 and 1995, the number of Indiana bats at major hibernating sites declined from more than 120,000 to nearly 20,000 (USFWS 2002).<br/><br/>Since 1950, the major winter colonies in caves in West Virginia, Indiana, and Illinois have disappeared. Wintering populations in Vermont have declined dramatically since the 1930s (Trombulak <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2001). The overall population at major roosts declined about 56% between 1960/1970 and 2003 (Clawson 2004). Hibernating populations in the southern part of the range have declined by 82% in the past 40 years, while those in the northern Midwest and Northeast have increased by 35% (Clawson 2004). However, according to Thogmartin <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> (2012), the species as a whole was stationary between 1983 and 2005 (0.5% mean annual change, 95% confidence interval [CI] -2.8, +1.8%).",Stable,"The range extends west to the western Ozark region in eastern Oklahoma (Saugey <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 1990) and Iowa (Clark <em>et al</em>. 1987), north and east to Michigan (Evers 1992, Kurta and Teramino 1994, Kurta 1995), New York, New England, and northern New Jersey, and south to northern Alabama and Arkansas, with accidental/non regular occurrences outside this range. The species has disappeared from or greatly declined in most of its former range in the northeastern United States (e.g., Trombulak <em>et al</em>. 2001). A disjunct population once existed in northwestern Florida, though old Florida records may represent accidental occurrences. <br/><br/>Most known maternity sites have been located in forested tracts in agriculturally dominated landscapes (e.g., Missouri, Iowa, Indiana, Illinois) (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 1999), but maternity colonies also exist to the south in heavily forested regions to at least eastern Tennessee and western North Carolina (Britzke <em>et al</em>. 2003). In summer these bats are apparently absent south of Tennessee. There is a July 1993 record for South Carolina (South Carolina Heritage Trust), but this record may lack adequate documentation, Menzel <em>et al</em>. (2003) did not report any records for the state.<br/><br/>Northern populations migrate south to Alabama, Tennessee, Kentucky, Indiana, Missouri, and West Virginia for winter. In winter, they are apparently absent from Michigan, Ohio, and northern Indiana where suitable caves and mines are unknown. The most important hibernating caves are: Bat Wing and Twin Domes caves (Indiana), Bat, Hundred Dome, and Dixon caves (Kentucky), and Bat Cave, Great Scott Cave, and Pilot Knob Mine (Missouri), Pilot Knob Mine is the largest colony (Lowe 1990). Half of the total population hibernates in southern Indiana.",,Terrestrial,"The most important hibernacula are protected, as are many hibernation sites that support fewer numbers of <em>M. sodalis</em>.

22053752,14123,Myotis bechsteinii,Near Threatened,,2016,2016-04-25 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"A rare species that occurs at low densities and has specific habitat requirements. Its population is fragmented and its sedentary habits mean that it does not colonize new areas easily. There is very little information on population trends, but it is suspected that the species is declining as a result of the loss and degradation of specific types of old-growth woodland, compounded by other threats such as human disturbance. It is suspected that these threats may result in a population decline approaching 30% over a 15 year period including both the past and the future. Consequently it is assessed as Near Threatened (approaching A4c).","This species has specialized habitat requirements and is largely dependent on mature natural forests. In the south-west Asia region it is found in broadleaf forest and sometimes mixed forest (K. Tsytsulina pers. comm. 2005). In Europe, it tends to prefer mature deciduous woodland of beech and oak with a high proportion of old trees. Densities of this species are highest in forests that are managed according to environmental (rather than strictly economic) principles. It is occasionally found in artificial habitats such as pasture, plantations (especially orchards) and rural gardens. In summer it roosts in tree-holes, or occasionally in buildings; bird and bat boxes are fairly readily accepted (Schlapp 1999). In winter it hibernates in underground habitats, and possibly also in hollow trees. It forages in woodland and along woodland edge for Lepidoptera, Diptera, Planipennia, and also non-flying insects. It is considered to be a sedentary species (Hutterer <em>et al.</em> 2005).","Threats include inappropriate management and development of woodland habitats, intensive agriculture (e.g., use of pesticides on farmland adjacent to woodland occupied by the species) and human disturbance of roost sites. The loss of old trees with hollows is a particular problem. In Germany, infrastructure developments (and associated habitat fragmentation) and forestry are the main threats (Schulenberg 2005).","It is considered rare throughout its range, although in optimal habitat it may be regularly found, and it is a typical member of central European bat communities.

In the eastern part of the range it congregates in winter in a few sites which are threatened by human disturbance. For 10 years up to 2008, it declined between 30 and 50% in Spain, with indications of declines also in other parts of the range. It only hunts in watercourses and is therefore threatened by water pollution and the development of tourist infrastructure, which is expected to continue in the future. It is suspected that population declines are underway that will exceed 30% over 18 years (3 generations), and for that reason the species is considered Vulnerable under criterion A4bce.","The Long-fingered Bat (<em>Myotis capaccinii</em>)&#160;depends strictly on aquatic habitats. It forages over wetlands and waterways (including artifical waterbodies, such as canals and reservoirs), also scrub. It seems to prefer clutter-free water surfaces when foraging, probably because the echolocation of preys is facilitated above them (Almenar <em>et al.</em>&#160;2009).It generally roosts in underground habitats (principally caves). In the Balkans it is confined to karst areas. Movements between summer and winter colonies are mostly within a distance of 50 km (maximum 140 km: Hutterer <em>et al.</em> 2005).","Threats include changes in water quality through pollution and dam building, and loss of water bodies and watercourses.

Generally, the population is fragmented, but these ""fragments"" may constitute robust parts of the overall population. Declines have been reported in many range states. In Spain, the population has declined by 30-50% in the last 10 years to fewer than 10,000 individuals. Only 30 colonies are known that comprise more than 20 individuals (Palomo and Gisbert 2002). At least six important colonies are threatened by the construction of buildings nearby and five colonies have disappeared over the last 10 years. In France the population has declined to very low numbers (an estimated 3,800 individuals). Colonies have been lost in the western part of the range in the last 15 years (S. Aulagnier pers. comm. 2006). Colonies in central Romania known from the 1960s have disappeared, and the species is now restricted to the south. The species is almost absent in winter and probably hibernates in Bulgaria (Z. Nagy pers. comm. 2006). The Bulgarian population is estimated at ca. 20,000. In Croatia there are still some large colonies but these are threatened by pollution of karstic water bodies (F. Spitzenberger pers. comm. 2006), and the species is listed as Endangered in the Croatian Red Book of Mammals (Tvrtkovic 2006).

Loss and degradation of aquatic habitats may threaten the species. There has been a rapid decline in the past in at least parts of Europe, and although this decline may now have slowed, it is nevertheless suspected to approach 30% over the last 15 years (3 generations). Consequently the species is assessed as Near Threatened (approaching A2c). Better knowledge on population trends, particularly in eastern parts of its range for which there is currently little information, might result in a downlisting to Least Concern.","This species feeds principally over open calm water, particularly canals, rivers and lakes, on small emerging and emergent insects, often taken from the water surface. It prefers water lined by open rough vegetation without trees.  Most of the known summer maternity roosts are in buildings, often in large attics and church steeples, in groups of 40-600. Some tree  and bat box roosts are recorded. It frequently hibernates in underground habitats ranging from natural caves to cellars and bunkers. It is a partial migrant, with winter and summer roosts often separated by more than 100 km (maximum recorded: 350 km, and it may need good habitat links between summer and winter roosts.","Threatened by habitat change, including renovation and maintenance of buildings with roosts involving the use of chemicals for remedial timber treatment that are toxic to mammals. Few nursery roost sites are known and many of these have been lost, although numbers in hibernation sites have shown a slower decline in The Netherlands.  Water pollution may also be a threat; the species already has a relatively restricted foraging habitat of broad, open flat water of canals, rivers and lakes with relatively open banks, with possibly some further  seasonal (summer) restriction within utilized habitat. Such restrictions in summer may be opportunistic rather than enforced, and it may be that the requirements for wider dispersal in spring, and possibly autumn, is more of a conservation problem than concentration in summer in good foraging habitat close to the roost. The requirements during migration are not known and may be a constraint (Limpens <em>et al.</em> 2000, Hutson <em>et al.</em> 2001)","It is rarely abundant, and ranks among the rarest bat species in Europe.

Some populations have been suffering reductions even before the onset of WNS, and the species was already considered uncommon over most of its distribution.","This species is most often detected during hibernation. In recent years, it has been counted at approximately 125 hibernacula. Recent surveys have greatly increased the number of localities above those known historically; the number of hibernacula may be significantly larger than currently known. Intensive cave and mine surveys have been undertaken in most states where the species occurs, but some sites probably remain unsearched in most states.<br/><br/>The total count for all hibernacula is approximately 3,000 individuals, with roughly 60% of the total number from just two sites in New York. Some of the occurrences probably have not been surveyed completely, and some individuals are undoubtedly missed within some sites because they are hibernating in portions of mines or caves that cannot be reached or easily observed.<br/><br/>This bat always has been considered to be relatively rare (Barbour and Davis 1969). Numbers are reduced in a few sites where older counts are available, and a few historical sites are apparently no longer occupied, but whether these observation reflect declines or changes in distribution is unknown. In Vermont, <em>Myotis leibii</em> has been consistently found in very small numbers and often not detected at all during periodic surveys of various hibernacula dating back to 1934 (Trombulak <em>et al.</em> 2001).<br/><br/>Habitat is mostly hilly or mountainous areas, in or near deciduous or evergreen forest, sometimes in mostly open farmland. In Pennsylvania, Mohr (1976) found this species mostly in heavy hemlock forests in the foothills of mountains that rise to 2,000 feet (600 meters). Unpublished data from the Kentucky Heritage Program indicate that summer roosts include caves, coal mines, buildings, and bridges over rivers (in expansion joints). Warm-season roosts include buildings, towers, hollow trees, spaces beneath the loose bark of trees, cliff crevices, and bridges. Tuttle (1964) reported two individuals found in April in Tennessee under a large flat rock at the edge of a quarry surrounded by woods and cow pastures. In Ontario, about 12 of these bats were found in July behind the door of a shed that was kept open (i.e., positioned against the wall) (Hitchcock 1955). They have been seen resting in limestone caves in West Virginia in spring and summer (Krutzsch 1966). <br/><br/>By far most records come from observations of bats hibernating in winter in caves and mine tunnels. Hibernation occurs in solution and fissure caves and mine tunnels (including coal, iron, copper, and talc mines). Situations near the entrance where the air is relatively cold and dry seem to be preferred (Barbour and Davis 1969), though sometimes deeper locations are used (Schwartz and Schwartz 1981). Roost sites often are deep in crevices, or under rocks on the cave floor, where the bats can be very difficult to find (Davis 1955, Krutzsch 1966, Martin <em>et al</em>. 1966). These bats are usually found singly or occasionally in small clusters, but many may be packed in a crevice; often they hang among other species (Marin <em>et al</em>. 1966). In tight places the body may be horizontal, even belly down. On cave walls, the forearms are somewhat extended rather than parallel to the body axis. Dunn and Hall (1989) noted that 52% of Pennsylvania hibernacula were small caves of less than 150 m (500 feet) in length. Like many other bat species, this one typically forages over ponds and streams.","Some mines may be threatened by closure or collapse. Ceiling collapse may kill bats outright or, more significantly, alter cave microhabitat enough to make it unsuitable. A few cave occurrences are threatened or have been reduced in quality due to commercialization for tourism. Threats to summer sites are unknown, but are likely to be moderate due to alteration of riparian habitats. Conversion of forested habitats to agricultural and residential uses has decreased the amount of preferred habitat in some areas, but the bats do make use of bridges and various other non-natural roost sites. Perhaps the most serious threat to cave-dwelling bats is human disturbance during hibernation. Very low levels of noise, light, and heat from lanterns are sufficient to awaken hibernating bats, which then expend energy moving about and deplete critical reserves of body fat.&#160;<br/><br/>Improper gating of caves to protect bats may result in site abandonment. For example, the large colony of <em>M. leibii </em>at Fourth Chute Cave, Quebec, was driven out by blocking the flow of cold air (Mohr 1976). In contrast, gating of cave entrances in other locations (e.g., Aitkin Cave, Pennsylvania) has led to increases in <em>M. leibii</em> populations. With its small numbers and spotty distribution, isolated colonies of <em>M. leibii </em>are particularly vulnerable to extirpation by chance events, especially when concentrated during winter months. On the other hand, in contrast to certain other bats that assemble in vast numbers in relatively few sites, the population of <em>M. leibii</em> as a whole is not vulnerable to localized events. This bat tends to hibernate near cave entrances; hence it may be vulnerable to freezing in abnormally severe winters.<br/><br/>Recently, the white-nose syndrome (WNS) is becoming the major threat to hibernating bats&#160; in caves (hibernacula) and a number of studies have called the attention that the spread of this disease can extirpate whole caves from the distribution range for some species, including <em>M. leibii </em>(Alves <em>et al</em>. 2014).","It seems to be uncommon in most localities and some authorities consider <em>M. leibii</em> to be one of the rarest bats in the eastern United States. Approximately 80% of the known occurrences are of poor estimated viability; just 7% are believed to have good or excellent viability. In most instances, surveys yield very few individuals of this species in any particular location. Most occurrences have been counted only within the past decade or two and are not revisited regularly, making the assessment of population trend difficult. Many biologists believe that this species is basically stable, having declined little in recent times, but that it is vulnerable, especially in its cave hibernacula. The population at one site in Arkansas has increased in recent years, probably due to reduced winter disturbance following the installation of a cave gate.<br/><br/>A study of the potential impact of white-nose syndrome (WNS) on bat populations (Alves <em>et al</em>. 2014) indicates a pessimistic scenario for <em>M. leibii</em>, which will probably be the most affected species, with more than 96% of population decline, and could be considered as Critically Endangered (CR). Even an intermediate scenario suggests a loss over 70% of its populations. The current distribution of this species is very congruent with the potential spread of WNS, encompassing all the Appalachian Mountains until the Arkansas River. The populations of <em>M. leibii </em>were considered stable before the onset of WNS, but some populations are already experiencing negative population trends.",Decreasing,"The range extends from New England, southeastern Ontario, and southwestern Quebec south and west to southeastern Oklahoma, Arkansas, northern Alabama, northern Georgia, and northwestern South Carolina (Menzel <em>et al.</em> 2003). Within this range, the distribution is very spotty, and the bulk of the occurrences and largest populations are in New York, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and western Virginia. Hall's (1981) map should be taken as potential range; there are no records of this species ever occurring in some parts of the indicated distribution (e.g., Illinois; Jim Herkert pers. comm). This species is apparently extirpated in Connecticut and Ohio (where it is known from only one specimen).

TNC has a management agreement giving limited protection to the largest occurrence and one occurrence with apparently good viability is on National Park Service land in Arkansas. Several occurrences with fair to poor estimated viability in various states are either owned by TNC or are on Federal land.<br/><br/>Summer surveys throughout the species known range should be a high priority for inventory work. Winter hibernacula surveys should continue with emphasis on searching sites which have not been surveyed, improving counts in sites which have not been completely or thoroughly surveyed, and monitoring some portion of the known sites on a regular basis (perhaps every other year as recommended for Myotis sodalis sites) to establish baseline population trend data.",Nearctic,,false,false,Global

This bat is found in a wide range of habitats, but is most commonly found in mixed coniferous forests, from humid coastal areas to montane forests.  In southern British Columbia, long-eared myotis roost in tree cavities in dense forests. In adapting to forest management in certain areas of British Columbia, they have recently been found to roost in the stumps of clear-cut stands. Long-eared myotis prefer the stumps of ponderosa pine and lodgepole pine in these areas. In the large uninterrupted forests of the Pacific Northwest, <em>M. evotis</em> uses large snags for day roosts. These bats usually prefer snags that reach high into or above the forest canopy. In the badlands of the South Sasketchawan River Valley in Alberta, <em>M. evotis</em> are mostly found roosting in the crevices of sandstone boulders. Other places which function as day roosts are abandoned buildings, cracks in the ground, caves, mines, and loose bark on living and dead trees.

Recent surveys (e.g., Hofmann <em>et al.</em> 1999, Mirowsky <em>et al</em>. 2004) suggest that the number of small maternity colonies may be quite large, but these are of uncertain viability. Only two large (more than 100 bats) winter colonies have been reported in recent years, but there are several small colonies throughout the species range. In Florida, large numbers form maternity colonies in caves; the species has been reported a few times in buildings. Maternity colonies also have been found in a small number of caves in Georgia and Alabama. In the rest of the deep south, these bats generally use buildings and other structures, mines, and hollow trees (e.g., water tupelo, black gum, water hickory, bald cypress) for spring and summer roosts. In Louisiana, a hollow water tupelo (<em>Nyssa aquatica</em>) studied in late summer and early fall contained about 50 individuals (Gooding and Langford 2004). By winter in this region they roost in small groups in outdoor sites, often over water, such as bridges, culverts, storm sewers, and boat houses, as well as in hollow trees (Barbour and Davis 1969). In Florida (and perhaps elsewhere) these bats also roost in caves in winter; apparently they may use different caves for summer and winter roosts (Gore and Havis 1992). In the north, the pattern of cave use is different. Kentucky populations winter in caves (often with <em>Myotis sodalis</em>) but are rare in most caves in the summer, when most roost in large hollow trees. The few old records from Indiana also were mostly from caves in winter. Summer roost sites are poorly known from this part of their range. At least one cave in Indiana had bats every month except May, June, and July (Mumford and Whitaker 1982). Only a few maternity colonies have been reported in this region: one was in the Kentucky cave already mentioned; additional maternity colonies exist in southern Illinois, where one was in a hollow-based water tupelo (<em>Nyssa aquatica</em>) (Hofmann <em>et al</em>. 1999). The key characteristics for maternity sites are high humidity and constant warm temperatures. Foraging habitat is riparian floodplain forests or wooded wetlands with permanent open water nearby (Gardner <em>et al</em>. 1992). These bats may forage primarily over lakes, ponds, or slow-moving streams.","Florida populations declined by about 50% from some 400,000 adult females in the 1950s (Rice 1957) to less than 200,000 females in 1991 (Gore and Hovis 1992). Not only did numbers of bats decline, but number of caves used as maternity roosts also declined by nearly 50% (from 15 to 18) in Florida over the same period. There is no indication that the population has stabilized. Some caves occupied in the early 1980s are no longer occupied (Gore and Hovis 1992). However, Brown (1997) reported that this species is adaptable and seems to be holding its own in the southeastern United States. <br/><br/>While the Florida population was thriving in the 1960s, Barbour and Davis (1969) reported that the Ohio River Valley population was steadily declining and apparently nearing extirpation. Current data from this northern range indicates that populations are still present in low numbers, although their status remains largely unknown. Indiana populations had declined considerably by 1980 (Mumford and Whitaker 1982), although populations were always small. Recent extensive searches in Illinois indicated that the population has become more restricted than in the past; only one hibernating colony was located, compared to nine previously known hibernating sites, and the bats were only found in four counties compared to six in the past. Georgia has 12 older records (before 1970), and only one record since 1970, but this change could be due to lack of searching. Recent field studies in coastal North Carolina, South Carolina, and eastern Texas have located populations of this species, but there are no baseline data with which to compare trends. Declines likely have resulted from various factors, especially human disturbance and physical alteration of caves used as hibernacula and maternity sites (Gore and Hovis 1992). Excessive human visitation may awaken bats and cause them to use up fat reserves. In maternity colonies, disturbance may cause females to abandon their young. Heavy collecting or banding may cause a population to vacate a site. Attempts to collect, even in winter, usually result in bats vacating at least temporarily (Mumford and Whitaker 1982). In addition, some caves have been made unavailable or degraded by the closing off of their entrances, installation of bat-impermeable barriers, forest removal around entrances, or by flooding by reservoirs. Loss of upland roosts increases vulnerability to mortality from sudden flooding. One cave formerly used by 11,000 individuals was turned into a public dump and virtually abandoned by bats. Clearing and draining of bottonland hardwood forest wetlands likely have reduced available habitat for summer roosting and foraging. The indirect effects of pesticide use are unknown.","Considering the total number of maternity roosts, hibernacula, and other occupied roosts and habitat, there are certainly more than 100 occurrences or subpopulations (Gore and Hovis 1992, Horner and Mirowsky 1996, Clark pers. comm.). Total adult population size is unknown but is at least in the 100,000s. This species is still abundant in some places. Florida has at least 18 current or former maternity caves which, in past years, potentially contained 400,000 adult females, a 1991 survey found only eight maternity caves with a total of less than 200,000 adult females (Gore and Hovis 1992).

A species of <em>Myotis</em> was observed foraging  above the seashore in Raja Ampat, but it is not known whether it was <em>M.  stalkeri </em>or <em>M. moluccarum </em>(Bouillard N. pers. comm.).<br/><br/>This species  is known to roost alongside other bat species (Flannery 1995, Meining  2002). Individuals found on the Kai Islands in 1993 were in a small  colony, sharing the roost with five other bat species (Flannery 1995).  The colony on Gebe consisted of about 100 individuals in a limestone  cave, surrounded by tall forest (Flannery 1995). At the time of the  collection, one of two adult females collected was carrying a single  young bat. Further, a cave roost on Waigeo was located near the sea and  surrounded by tropical forest.&#160; <br/>The generation length of <em>Myotis stalkeri</em> is estimated to be 5.8 (Pacifici <em>et al.</em> 2013).","The threats to this species are not fully known, but likely includes habitat loss due to logging (Karin <em>et al.</em>  2018, Widyatmoko 2017) and disturbance of cave-roosts. One emerging  threat that is likely to have a major impact on the species in the  future is mining, an activity that is increasing on Eastern Indonesian  islands such as Waigeo (Bailey and Pitcher 2008). Nickel mining in  particular is likely to affect the water quality, and therefore its fish  and insect populations of a significant number of freshwater ponds  (Rathore <em>et al.</em> 2003, Pourkhabbaz <em>et al.</em> 2011, Mayani-Parás <em>et al.</em> 2019).","Little is known about the population size of <em>Myotis stalkeri</em>. It is believed  to be a relatively uncommon species, with an estimated 10,000–11,000 mature  individuals. The population is inferred to be declining due to the loss  and degradation of its habitat threats from cave disturbance, logging,  and mining throughout its range. It is believed to be organized into  four (4) subpopulations based on its fragmented distribution  among islands (Flannery 1995, Meinig 2002, Helgen 2007).

It roosts in tight clusters in caves, mine tunnels, buildings, and under bridges. These colonies can number from 50 to 15,000 individuals (Fitch <em>et al.</em> 1981, Reid 2009). This bat leaves the roost about 30 minutes after sunset and flies directly to water to drink before foraging. It usually forages just above the vegetation, with fast, direct flight. Females return to the day roost within 2 to 3 hours and feed again before dawn. Like most North American bats, this species is insectivorous, insects eaten include beetles, flying ants, and moths. Its diet changes with the season and habitat. The cave myotis normally feeds twice a night during the summer, once soon after sunset and again just before sunrise. Some northern populations hibernate in winter, others migrate. Populations in Mexico move to higher elevations in winter to hibernate (Wilson and Ruff 1999). In New Mexico, this species is active at temperatures (18 to 26 °C) higher than other species of <em>Myotis</em>, except <em>M. yumanensis</em> (17 to 27 °C).

Despite its presumed large population and occurrence in a number of protected areas, a decline at nearly the rate required to qualify for listing in a threatened category is very likely.","Northern bats are associated with boreal forests. In British Columbia they are found in the wet forests of the interior cedar-hemlock biogeoclimatic zone. In areas of North America and Canada these bats choose maternity roosts in buildings, under loose bark, and in the cavities of trees. Adults, males and females, roost singly or in small groups (less than 10 individuals) in or on buildings, caves or trees. Caves and underground mines are their choice sites for hibernating (Caceres and Barclay 2000). This species feeds on Lepidoptera, Coleoptera, Neuroptera, Diprea, Hemiptera, Homoptera, and Hymenoptera; the diet varies between localities and seasons. The Northern Myotis is an opportunistic forager and is probably limited only by the size of the prey (Caceres and Barclay 2000).","Timber harvesting may interfere with these bats' ability to utilize trees for nursery colonies and day roosts. It also may prove detrimental to their foraging habits in forested areas. Use of chemical and biological insecticides is another source of concern affecting their food supply. A less vital, yet very real threat to <em>M. septentrionalis</em> is the disturbance they face in the caves (where recreational ""caving"" is popular) or mines (which are often closed after being abandoned) where they hibernate. A solution to the problem of disturbance at hibernacula is to put up gates that permit the bats to pass while excluding humans (Thomas 1993).<br/>Recently, the white-nose syndrome (WNS) has become a major threat for this and other North American bats (Alves <em>et al</em>. 2014). Although the impact on its populations has been already recorded, with a larger expansion of the disease it might result in a severe impact on caves and hibernacula that are used by the species.","At most sites they are much less common than other species (Wilson and Ruff 1999). During the summer northern bats are commonly found in higher densities around the northern areas of their range, as they are especially reliant upon the richly forested habitats in the north around this time (Altringham 1996). Occasionally, these bats may be found roosting with other bat species, although they are much less social than other members of the genus <em>Myotis</em>. The sexes roost separately; however, reproductive females may form small maternity colonies of less than 60 individuals (Altringham 1996). It is uncommon at western extremes of its range (Caceres and Barclay 2000).<br/>Under the spread of white-nose syndrome (WNS), a pessimistic scenario of population decline revealed that nine North American species (including <em>M. septentrionalis</em>), would be susceptible to WNS and expected to lose over 25% of their entire population. This species presented stable populations before the onset of the disease, but now it is confirmed with negative population trends due to WNS (Alves&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014).",Decreasing,"This species is found in eastern United States and Canada west to British Columbia, Eastern Montana, Eastern Wyoming; south to Alabama, Georgia, and northern Florida (Simmons 2005).",,Terrestrial,"Although this species occurs in several protected areas, some measurements for habitat management are necessary to protect it.

Flight is stronger, more direct, and with less flutter than most other bats of the genus. These bats begin emerging from the daytime roost well before dark, fill their stomachs within about 0.5 hour of foraging, and retire to some shelter such as a building, cave, or mine for a night resting period. These bats feed mainly upon moths but have been known to eat a variety of other, mostly soft-bodied, insects such as flies, termites, lacewings, wasps, true bugs, leaf-hoppers, and small beetles (Warner and Czaplewski 1984).","There are no major threats throughout the species' range. Long-legged Myotis may be affected by closure of abandoned mines without adequate surveys, disturbance by humans,&#160;and certain forest management practices that reduce foraging habitat quality, availability of roosts or increase habitat fragmentation. Residues of DDT and its metabolites have been found in this species in Oregon.","This species occurs in colonies of 2,000-5,000 individuals throughout much of its range. Total adult population size is unknown but apparently quite large (likely greater than 100,000).&#160;Habitats vary from desert floodplains and rocky canyonlands to the cave country from central Texas to southcentral Kansas. In summer, this species congregates in caves, mines, and less often in buildings. Most individuals in populations in Arizona and California appear to be migratory and most in Kansas, Oklahoma, and Texas appear to be permanent residents that hibernate in caves during winter. In Texas, recent data indicate that this species appears to be relatively common in areas where formerly it was thought to be rare (Bradley <em>et al</em>. 1999, Higginbotham <em>et al</em>. 2002).",Stable,"The species is found from Jalisco to Veracruz (Mexico), Alaska Panhandle (USA) to Baja California (Mexico), east to Northern Nuevo León (Mexico), South Dakota (USA), and Central Alberta (Canada) (Simmons 2005).",,Terrestrial,"Some forest management practices can affect availability of key resources; but, probably this bat is secure throughout much of range.

22070543,14261,Mystacina tuberculata,Vulnerable,A4bce,2021,2020-10-15 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<em>Mystacina tuberculata </em>is assessed as Vulnerable under criterion A4bce as its population and number of mature individuals is expected to  continue to decline by 30–35% over three generations (generation length = 4 years; three generations = 12 years), including some estimated reduction in the past and projected reduction in the future (2012–2024). This species' population is  severely fragmented and there are 12 geographically separated  subpopulations remaining. Of 15 subpopulations known before 2000, three  appear to have disappeared (Oparara, Tararua and Mamaku Plateau), the  status of four subpopulations are uncertain because there are few recent  sightings and no recent surveys (Waitotara-Tahupo, Raukumara, Kaimanawa,  North Taranaki-Waitaanga), and two subpopulations appear to be very small  (&lt;200 bats) (Murchison Mountains, Omahuta-Puketi, O’Donnell <em>et al.</em>  2018, R. Jackson pers. comm.). Less than half the current  subpopulations are subject to some conservation management, and it is  estimated that unmanaged populations are declining by 1% per annum due  to the loss of forest habitat and invasive species (O’Donnell <em>et al.</em>  2010). The remaining six populations are now being managed effectively  and are stable or increasing (Whenua Hou/Codfish Island, Hauturu/Little  Barrier Island, Whirinaki, Rangataua and Pureora forests (North Island)  and Eglinton Valley (South Island) (S. Willis, M. Pryde, A. Beath  pers.comm., O’Donnell <em>et al.</em> 2011, Edmonds <em>et al.</em> 2017).  There is a continuing decline in its extent of occurrence, area  of occupancy, quality of habitat, number of locations and  subpopulations, and the number of mature individuals.","Lesser Short-tailed Bats are associated with old-growth temperate  forest, with large trees available for colonial roosts, abundant  epiphytes and deep leaf-litter (Parsons and Toft 2021). Colonial  breeding trees per colony number only 20–30 (Sedgeley 2003, 2006; Christie and O’Donnell 2015). These roosts have very specific physical  and microhabitat characteristics, which are now very rare in New Zealand  forests because of the history of logging (Sedgeley 2003, 2006). The  species has been recorded at low numbers in logged forest, shrubland,  pine plantations, and farmland in areas adjacent to unlogged old-growth  forest (Parsons and Toft 2021). Although the species primarily roosts in  tree cavities, there are records of the species using caves for  roosting (Parsons and Toft 2021).<br/><br/>Lesser Short-tailed Bats are  primarily insectivorous but also consume nectar, pollen, and fruit  (Parsons and Toft 2021). Lesser short-tailed bats undergo periods of  torpor and seasonal hibernation (Czenze <em>et al.</em> 2016, 2017). The species uses a lek mating system (Toth <em>et al.</em> 2018.). Females annually give birth to a single young (Parsons and Toft 2021).<br/>The species is non-migratory and the colonies have large home ranges (<em>ca</em> 150 km², Christie and O’Donnell 2015).","Old-growth roost trees are very important to the species. Lesser Short-tailed Bats are thought to have declined through forest clearance  following human settlement of New Zealand.<br/><br/>Predation by  introduced stoats and rats (Ship Rats, Pacific Rats) has also been, and  continues to be, a major threat to this species (O’Donnell <em>et al.</em>  2010). This is evident from the increase in bats on Codfish Island  following the removal of Pacific rats, as well as increases in the  Eglinton Valley following the initiation of comprehensive rat and stoat  control (O’Donnell <em>et al.</em> 2011, Edmonds <em>et al.</em> 2017).  Stoats and rats are also known to visit colonial roosts and are  suspected as the reason for the critical status of the Northland  subpopulation in areas where no logging has occurred. Furthermore, these  bats disappeared from the southern Titi Islands when ship rats were  introduced. In addition, feral cats have been identified as predators,  deep into the forest. In one instance, a feral cat killed &gt;100  short-tailed bats before it was trapped (Scrimgeour <em>et al.</em> 2012).<br/><br/>Populations  of this species also appear to be minimally impacted by poisoning  through consumption of bait distributed in New Zealand forests to  control invasive vertebrate species, and also through secondary  poisoning resulting from consumption of invertebrates that have fed on  poisoned bait (O’Donnell <em>et al.</em> 2011, Edmonds <em>et al.</em> 2017, Dennis and Gartrell 2015).","Large numbers have been recorded in several unlogged old-growth forests  (Parsons and Toft 2021). The largest colony count was 8,412 bats  (including young of the year) from a managed site (Rangataua) in 2019  (A. Beath 2019). Maximum counts from known colonies sum to &gt;24,535  individuals (post 2000). These largely reflect increasing numbers in six  subpopulations that are being actively managed (Whenua Hou/Codfish  Island &gt;2,000, Hauturu/Little Barrier Island (&gt;2,000), Whirinaki  (&gt;5,146), Rangataua &gt;8,412, Pureora &gt;960, Eglinton Valley  &gt;29,47). Annual survival of <em>ca</em> 50% without predator control in the  Eglinton Valley would have been catastrophic if unmanaged. However,  since predator control was initiated, numbers have steadily increased  from <em>ca</em> 400 to &gt;3,000 (R. Jackson pers. comm., Edmonds <em>et al.</em> 2017).<br/><br/>The  remaining nine subpopulations (60%) known prior to 2000 have now either  disappeared, are very small and/or are declining. They are largely unmanaged  are likely to be declining (&gt;30% over three generations, O’Donnell  2010), Thus, overall, the population is suspected to still be declining.  <br/><br/>The geographic range of the species is now very limited. Colony home ranges span <em>ca</em> 150 km² apiece (O'Donnell <em>et al.</em>  1999, Christie and O’Donnell 2015). Within these, the range covering  the core roosting/breeding sites are much smaller (17 ha in one study; Christie and O’Donnell 2015).

A decline is also expected to  exceed 30% over the period encompassing the past 1 and at least two future generations (2014–2035).<br/><br/>The decline in population is inferred from  substantial loss and degradation of foraging habitat due to fire and  clearing, mass mortalities associated with extreme heat and food  shortages, and mortality from electrocution on power lines, and  entanglement in barbed wire and fruit tree netting. In particular,  extreme weather conditions in 2019-20 saw tens of thousands of  individuals die from food shortages and extreme heat events, and  unprecedented megafires affected 33.7% of the species’ total habitat  whereby 41.7% of the species' critical ‘winter’ foraging resources were  lost to high severity fires.<br/>The rate of decline is expected to  increase over at least the future two generations due to the increasing  frequency and intensity of extreme weather and climate events such as  heat events, droughts, floods and fires, along with changes in the  production of nectar, pollen and fleshy fruits in native vegetation,  largely unregulated land clearing associated with urban expansion,  agriculture intensification and human population growth, and increased  exposure of the species to anthropogenic threats in urban environments.  The capacity of the species to recover from increased mortality caused  by frequent or persistent threats is hampered by their low reproductive  rate, and low population growth rate even under optimal conditions.","The Grey-Headed Flying Fox is found in subtropical moist forest, open  forest, closed and open woodlands, Melaleuca swamps, Banksia woodlands,  mangroves, commercial fruit plantations (Hall and Richards 2000), and  increasingly in urban landscapes (e.g., Williams <em>et al.</em> 2006, Plowright <em>et al.</em> 2011, Boardman <em>et al.</em> 2021, Meade <em>et al.</em> 2021).<br/><br/>The  diet consists of nectar, pollen and fruits of a wide range of species,  most commonly native trees in the families Myrtaceae, Moraceae,  Proteaceae and a small number of species from other families. (Eby 1998,  Hall and Richards 2000, Eby and Law 2008, Schmelitschek <em>et al.</em>  2009). The primary native food sources are the nectar and pollen of  <em>Eucalyptus</em>, <em>Corymbia</em>, <em>Angophora</em>, <em>Banksia</em>, <em>Melaleuca</em> species, and fleshy  rainforest fruits (Eby and Law 2008, Eby 1991); and they are known to  consume leaves, bark, and invertebrates (Clulow and Blundell 2011, Smith  <em>et al.</em> 2020, Schmelitschek <em>et al.</em> 2009). They also forage  in agricultural areas, including orchards, and in introduced vegetation  in urban areas (McDonald-Madden <em>et al.</em> 2005, Boardman <em>et al.</em> 2021).<br/><br/>The  majority of native diet plants have regular seasonal flowering  phenologies, but do not flower every year (Eby and Law 2008).  Grey-headed flying foxes experience seasonal food bottlenecks during  winter and spring when few diet plants are productive and the  distribution of native foraging habitat is limited (Eby and Law 2008).  Vegetation communities that contain plants that flower in winter and  early spring are of particular importance to the species during critical  periods in the reproductive cycle and have been identified as habitat  critical to survival (Eby <em>et al.</em> 1999, Eby and Law 2008, DAWE 2021).<br/><br/>The Grey-Headed Flying Fox lacks biological adaptations such as torpor to  withstand food shortages, instead individuals are thought to move in  response to changes in local food abundance (DAWE 2021). It is a highly  mobile species with individuals estimated to travel up to  2,500 km annually within a network of roosts located across southeastern  Australia (Eby 1991, Tidemann and Nelson 2004, Roberts <em>et al.</em> 2012a, Welbergen <em>et al.</em>  2020). On a nightly basis, individual bats may forage as far as 50 km  from their roost. However, mean foraging distances are between 6 and 11  km, with foraging distances shorter in urban than in non-urban areas  (Meade <em>et al.</em> 2021). There are few areas within the range where  nectar and other food sources are available continuously, except perhaps  in urban areas. While many flying-foxes feed in urban areas and urban  roosts may be permanently occupied, a proportion of the individuals  within these roosts move regularly between urban and other more natural  settings (Meade <em>et al.</em> 2021).<br/><br/>It roosts by day colonially in  canopy vegetation and many roosts have a long history of use (Lunney and  Moon 1997). Individuals move nomadically throughout the species' range  within a network of roosts, and change roosts frequently (Roberts <em>et al.</em> 2012a, Welbergen <em>et al.</em>  2020). Some roosts may temporarily contain &gt;100,000 individuals,  often coinciding with periodic flowering of preferred tree species (Eby  1991, Eby <em>et al.</em> 1999).<br/><br/>The Grey-Headed Flying Fox&#160;regularly  cohabits roosts with the black flying fox (<em>P. alecto</em>) and Little Red Flying Fox (<em>P. scapulatus</em>) with which it is partially sympatric (Timmiss  <em>et al.</em> 2021), and rarely with the Spectacled Flying Fox (<em>P. conspicillatus</em>) in the north of its range (Parsons <em>et al.</em>  2010). Of the 310 known camps in regular use, almost 75% are shared  with other species and only 25% are occupied exclusively by the Grey-Headed Flying Fox&#160;(Timmiss <em>et al.</em> 2021).<br/><br/>The majority of camps (58.7%) are located in urban areas (Timmiss <em>et al.</em>  2021). From 1998 to 2019, the number of active roost sites increased by  approximately 120% and average population size at camps declined, with  94% of new roosts formed in urban areas (Eby <em>et al.</em> submitted).  The pattern of increase in roost numbers has been stepped rather than  continuous, in association with periods of food shortage (Eby <em>et al.</em>  submitted). The drivers of increasing urbanisation of the species are  unclear. Increased temporal stability (Markus and Hall 2004,  McDonald‐Madden <em>et al.</em> 2005, Parry‐Jones and Augee 2001, Plowright <em>et al.</em> 2011, Williams <em>et al.</em> 2006) and availability (Markus and Hall 2004, Plowright <em>et al.</em> 2011, Williams <em>et al.</em>  2006) of food resources from urban plantings may be responsible for the  recently observed increased presence of flying-foxes of urban areas  (Meade <em>et al.</em> 2021), however, broadscale reductions in feeding  opportunities in native habitats may also play a role (Parry-Jones and  Augee 2001, van der Ree <em>et al.</em> 2006, Williams <em>et al.</em> 2006, Tait <em>et al.</em> 2014, P. Eby unpublished data).<br/><br/>In  the roosts, males establish ‘mating territories’ that are actively  maintained by aggression, which is especially evident during the mating  season (March-May, Martin <em>et al.</em> 1993; Martin <em>et al.</em> 1995; Eby 1995; Nelson 1965; Welbergen 2010, 2011). Males mate repeatedly  with the same female during a mating session and can have multiple  mating sessions with the same female over the course of several days  (Welbergen 2005). Males, but not females, accumulate body mass prior to  establishing their territories and can lose more than 20 percent of  their mass during the mating season (Welbergen 2011).&#160;&#160; <br/>The most likely time of conception is April (Martin <em>et al.</em> 1993, Martin <em>et al.</em> 1995). Pregnancy in <em>P. poliocephalus</em> is seasonal, lasts for approximately 27 weeks (Martin <em>et al.</em>  1987) and the majority of females give birth to a single young annually  between late September and early November, although small numbers of  females give birth outside this time (Justin Welbergen pers. comm.).  Lactation lasts approximately 5–6 months (Martin <em>et al.</em> 1996), with the majority of young being weaned by the start of the mating season in March (Welbergen 2011).<br/><br/>Twins  are rare and there are no observations of twins surviving to weaning  (Peggy Eby pers. comm.). Sexual maturity is reached in the second year  (females) or third year (males) after birth (Welbergen 2010), and  generation length is estimated to be between 6 and 8 years (Woinarski <em>et al.</em> 2014, A. Divljan pers. comm).","Grey-Headed Flying Foxes are exposed to significant threats from  increasingly rapid human-induced environmental change, particularly loss  of foraging habitat and climate change impacts (DAWE 2021). They are  also impacted by increasing levels of conflict with humans at urban  roosts (Roberts <em>et al.</em> 2021). Key threats often act concurrently  and their impacts on population size are exacerbated by the species’ low  reproductive output, limiting its capacity to recover from impacts  (McIlwee and Martin 2002). Threats are predicted to increase in  frequency and severity in coming decades and, as a result, rates of  decline are expected to increase (Woinarski <em>et al.</em> 2014).<br/><br/>The  species is dependent on continuous access to flowering and fruiting food  plants sourced from widespread areas of native vegetation. Reduction in  food availability from loss and degradation of native habitat and  impacts of climate change, particularly drought and fires, is a key  threat (Woinarski <em>et al.</em> 2014, DAWE 2021). Incremental clearing  of critical winter/spring foraging habitat for urban expansion and  agriculture intensification is largely unregulated and is ongoing in  many regions. For example, loss of critical winter habitat was  associated with a collapse in winter influxes of nomadic animals into  far southeast Queensland from 1996 to 2018 (Eby <em>et al.</em> submitted).<br/><br/>Climate-driven  food shortages affect the species throughout its range and are  associated with population-wide increases in mortality (assessed from  rates of intake by wildlife rehabilitation organizations) and reductions  in pre-weaning reproductive success (DAWE 2021, Eby <em>et al.</em> submitted, Mo <em>et al.</em>  2021). Food shortages were recorded every 3 years on average from 1998  to 2020 (range 1-4 years) and were associated with absence or very low  intensity of flowering in native forests (Eby <em>et al.</em> submitted).  Food shortage impacts are generally global across the range of the  species and pre-weaning reproductive success assessed over 23 years  (1998 to 2021) and averaged across roosts in New South Wales was 56% in  food shortage years relative to 89% in non-food shortage years (P. Eby  unpublished data). This represents only a partial assessment of impact,  as adult female mortality was not considered in the denominators. Roosts  affected by the impact of extreme heat were not included in the data.  Repeated reductions in reproduction may reduce the capacity of the  species to recover from decline.<br/><br/>Extreme heat events, whereby  ambient temperatures exceed 42°, are known to cause mass mortality of  flying-foxes at landscape scales, and this has become a prominent  conservation management issue in Australia. Welbergen <em>et al.</em>  (2008) reported that between 1994 and 2008, &gt;30,000 Australian  flying-foxes, of which 24,500 were <em>P. poliocephalus</em>, had died during 19  separate extreme heat events. Between 2008 and 2019 a further 131.00  flying foxes died in several such events, including &gt;40,000 <em>P.  poliocephalus</em> individuals (Welbergen 2021, Welbergen <em>et al.</em>  unpublished). During the 2019-20 summer, 72,000 flying foxes died from  hyperthermia during eight separate extreme heat events, with <em>P.  poliocephalus</em> individuals comprising the majority of the mortality  estimate (Mo <em>et al.</em> 2021). The recorded deaths are likely  substantial underestimates of the true mortality as many roosts are not  inspected following events and where inspected mortality is often  underreported (Mo <em>et al.</em> 2021, Welbergen, pers. comm.). Adult  females and dependent young are disproportionately susceptible to  hyperthermia, which negatively affects recruitment and the effective  breeding population limiting the species’ capacity for recovery  (Welbergen <em>et al.</em> 2008).<br/><br/>Wildfires have also recently gained  significance as threats to the Grey-Headed Flying Fox. During the  extreme Austral 2019–20 summer, unprecedented bushfires affected an  estimated 5.8 Mha of temperate broadleaf forest within <em>P. poliocephalus</em>&#160;range, burning 33.7% of the species’ total habitat. This included 41.7%  critical ‘winter’ habitat which burnt in high severity fires  (Baranowski <em>et al.</em> 2021). It is likely that significant impacts  of the 2019-2020 bushfires on the species will be associated with both  the short-term effective loss of foraging habitat and the longer-term  reduction in nectar production, particularly in areas affected by  high-severity fire. At present, there are insufficient data available to  estimate the impact on the <em>P. poliocephalus </em>population or predict its  trajectory of post-fire recovery.<br/><br/>Anthropogenic changes in extreme  heat events and associated droughts and wildfires are already readily  observable in southeastern Australia and are expected to continue to  escalate in frequency and intensity in the coming decades (IPCC 2021,  Herold <em>et al.</em> 2021). As such, the already substantial die-offs  from food shortages and extreme heat, and habitat loss from wildfires  are anticipated to continue to gain significance as threats to the  species.<br/><br/>The recent urbanisation of roosts exposes the species to  several threats. Conflict between people and Grey-Headed Flying Foxes&#160;is  an ongoing problem that may cause loss or degradation of roosting  habitat and reduce community support for conservation initiatives (DAWE  2021). Flying-foxes are commonly perceived to be an annoyance, or  disease risk due to the noise and smell they emit and camps close to  human settlements are regularly subject to attempts to exclude the bats,  or clear vegetation in or around roosts to manipulate fine-scale  roosting positions (DAWE 2021, Roberts <em>et al.</em> 2021, Welbergen <em>et al.</em>  2020). Other threats include entanglement in fruit tree netting or  barbed wire fencing, electrocution on power lines, and vehicle  collisions. In a study of 532 Grey-Headed Flying Foxes&#160;admitted to  emergency care in Victoria, Scheelings and Frith (2015) found  anthropogenic factors caused the majority (63.7%) of admissions, with  entanglement in fruit tree netting the most common cause (36.8%)  followed by entanglement in barbed wire fencing (12.4%). Roosts once  isolated from humans have become embedded in urban areas due to  increasing urban expansion in coastal New South Wales and Queensland  (DAWE 2021).<br/><br/>Grey-Headed Flying Foxes may cause damage to fruit  crops in both commercial and backyard orchards, and lethal control  methods were commonly used in the past, including electrocution and  shooting (DAWE 2021). Historically culling was a major cause of  mortality (Woinarski <em>et al.</em> 2014). However, there have been  efforts to reduce the number of flying-foxes killed by orchardists  through Government subsidised netting programs, and overall, the impact  of this threat has declined. Queensland still issues permits to cull up  to 1,280 individuals per year (DAWE 2021).<br/><br/>Interspecific competition  with the black flying fox (<em>Pteropus alecto</em>) may also be a threat to the Grey-Headed Flying Fox&#160;(Woinarski <em>et al.</em> 2014, Roberts <em>et al.</em>  2012b). Although there is no evidence of interspecific competition, the  black flying fox has been expanding both in range and abundance in the  northern parts of the Grey-Headed Flying Fox’s range (Woinarski <em>et al.</em> 2014, Roberts <em>et al.</em> 2012a).<br/>Apart from culling by orchardists, all other threats are likely to continue or increase in severity and impact into the future.","This species forms a single, extremely mobile, interbreeding population distributed over a vast area (DAWE 2021, Welbergen <em>et al.</em> 2020).&#160;The Grey-Headed Flying Fox&#160;was considered abundant and estimated to number  in the many millions in the early 20th century (Ratcliffe 1931).  However, distribution-wide autumn population counts, based on counts of  individuals at known camps across the species range, varied between  320,000 and 674,000 (mean of 450,714) between 1989 and 2005 (Woinarski <em>et al.</em>  2014). Subsequently a national program of largely synchronous quarterly  population estimates was established in November 2012 (Westcott <em>et al.</em>  2015), and its autumn population counts varied between 522,000 and  663,000 (mean 570.900) over the period 2013-2019 (NFFMP, 2021). However,  counts from the periods 1989-2005 and 2013-2019 are not directly  comparable because of the differences in the methods used and  uncertainty about the survey coverage of the extent of the population  (Westcott <em>et al.</em> 2015). In addition, distribution-wide counts  lack precision due to the unknown proportion of individuals at unsampled  camps, and inconsistencies in sampling effort and counting methods used  among individual roost sites (DAWE 2021, Woinarski <em>et al.</em> 2014, Westcott <em>et al.</em>  2015). Due to limited precision, the time taken to reach 80%  statistical power in detecting trends in the recent distribution-wide  counts has been modelled to be ~13.5 years, or until 2027 (Westcott <em>et al.</em>  2012). However, recent work suggests that the main method used for  counting individuals in roosts is much less precise than was assumed in  the modelling (McCarty <em>et al.</em> submitted). While efforts are currently underway to improve the reliability of count estimates (McCarthy <em>et al.&#160;</em>2021, McCarthy <em>et al.</em>  submitted), until precision of the distribution-wide counts is improved  and better defined, it is not possible to establish meaningful trends  using current timeframes of population monitoring.<br/><br/>During the austral  spring and summer of 2019–2020, <em>P. poliocephalus </em>was exposed to a  sequence of circumstances associated with prolonged drought and extreme  heat, which resulted in tens of thousands of deaths (Mo <em>et al.</em> 2021), near reproductive failure and the burning of over a third of its habitat (Baranowski <em>et al.</em> 2021).<br/> <br/>At  this time, the species experienced an extended and intense food  shortage across a broad area of northern New South Wales and  southeastern Queensland, resulting in a large but unquantified number of  flying-fox deaths, possibly in the tens of thousands based on anecdotal  reports from wildlife carers (Mo <em>et al.</em> 2021). Pre-weaning reproduction at that time fell to 6% from a 21-year average of 74% (P. Eby unpublished data).<br/><br/>In  addition, in the summer of 2019–2020, 72,000 flying-foxes died from  hyperthermia during eight separate extreme heat events throughout  eastern and southeastern Australia, with <em>P. poliocephalus</em> comprising the  majority of the mortality estimate (Mo <em>et al.</em> 2021). The  recorded deaths are likely substantial underestimates of the true  mortality as many roosts are not inspected following events and where  inspected mortality is often underreported (Mo <em>et al.</em> 2021, Welbergen, pers. comm.).<br/><br/>Furthermore,  in the summer of 2019–20, unprecedented bushfires affected an estimated  5.8 million hectares of forest within <em>P. poliocephalus</em>&#160;range, burning  33.7% of the species’ total habitat. This included 41.7% of the species'  critical ‘winter’ habitat which burnt in high severity fires (Baranowski  <em>et al.</em> 2021). It is likely that significant impacts of the  2019–2020 bushfires on the species will be associated with both the  short-term effective loss of foraging habitat and the longer-term  reduction in nectar production, particularly in areas affected by  high-severity fire.<br/><br/>Anthropogenic changes in extreme heat events and  associated droughts and wildfires are already readily observable in  southeastern Australia and are expected to continue to escalate in  frequency and intensity in the coming decades (IPCC 2021, Herold <em>et al.</em>  2021). In conjunction with other ongoing causes of decline that  contributed to the species’ previous listing as Vulnerable under  criteria A2ace, these extreme events are anticipated to amount to a  decline in mature individuals exceeding 30% over the period <em>ca</em> 2014–2035, equivalent to the previous one and future two generations under criteria  A4.",Decreasing,"The geographic range of the species has altered in the past 20 years as documented by range-wide monitoring (Westcott <em>et al.</em> 2012), satellite telemetry studies (Roberts <em>et al.</em> 2012a, Welbergen <em>et al.</em> 2020), a systematic search of field records (Roberts <em>et al.</em> 2012b) and public reporting. While latitudinal range boundaries have remained generally stable (Roberts <em>et al.</em>  2012b), there has been a distinct inland expansion. As of 2021 the  range spans the coastal lowlands, tablelands, and slopes of eastern  Australia, from Finch Hatton near Mackay (Queensland) in the north to  Melbourne, Geelong (Victoria) in the south (Roberts <em>et al.</em> 2012b, Woinarski <em>et al.</em>  2014) and inland to Port Augusta in South Australia, Cooma in the Snowy  Mountains of New South Wales (New South Wales), and areas of central  and southern New South Wales and Victoria including Dubbo, Wagga Wagga  and Albury (New South Wales), Numurkah and Bendigo (Victoria). There  have also been vagrant sightings outside of this range, including  occasional sightings in Tasmania and Bass Strait islands (Atlas of  Living Australia 2021, DAWE 2021). Sightings in Tasmania and islands in  Bass Strait are associated with periods of acute food shortage (Eby <em>et al.</em> 2021).<br/><br/>The  great majority of observations and camps of this species are from the  coastal lowlands and slopes of south eastern Australia below altitudes  of about 200 m (DAWE 2021, Welbergen <em>et al.</em> unpublished data).  However, known roosts vary in elevation from sea level to 800 m (Cooma),  and occasionally vagrant individuals have been reported from altitudes  up to 1,600 m in the New South Wales and Victorian high country (M.  Pennay pers. comm., Welbergen <em>et al.</em> unpublished data). Along the  southern periphery of its range, the species has increased in abundance  in urban areas including Canberra (Australian Capital Territory),  Melbourne, Geelong and Bendigo (Victoria), and Adelaide (South  Australia) (Woinarski <em>et al.</em> 2014).<br/><br/>The species is typically  found from sea level to 800 m asl, with vagrants being documented up to  1,600 m asl.","The species is not known to be hunted, used, or traded.",Terrestrial,"This species is known to use a broad range of areas reserved for  conservation, which make up 12.6% of the area surrounding known camps,  however, only 5.2% of the camps occur within conservation areas (Timmiss  <em>et al.</em> 2021). Given the species' reliance on dispersed food  resources, conservation areas are unlikely to protect sufficient habitat  for the species.<br/><br/>A range of management actions and research to  assist conservation of <em>P. poliocephalus</em> into the future has been  identified in the National Recovery Plan for the species (DAWE 2021).  They include: identify, protect and increase roosting habitat and native  foraging habitat that is critical to survival, define and improve  precision in current population monitoring to determine reliable trends  in population size, build community capacity to coexist with flying  foxes and improve management of conflict at roosts in urban areas,  reduce the impact of electrocution on power lines, and entanglement in  netting and on barbed wire, significantly reduce levels of harm in  commercial fruit crops, support research that will improve conservation  and management, develop and apply ameliorative care procedures to  minimise deaths during extreme heat days, and management of fire (DAWE  2021).<br/><br/>In recent years, governments have funded and administered a  number of programs of subsidies to improve conservation outcomes for <em>P.  poliocephalus</em>. Plans of Management for several roosts have been  developed by land managers in consultation with affected stakeholders  (Roberts <em>et al.</em> 2012). The plans set out programs for managing  contentious roosts under various conditions, and can serve as effective  mechanisms for both reducing conflict and educating the public about the  conservation and management challenges that face <em>P. poliocephalus</em>.  Government subsidies in New South Wales have enabled commercial  orchardists to install full exclusion netting to protect their crops  from flying fox damage in advance of a halt to licenced culling on  crops.

Individuals occasionally gather in small clusters in cooler sections of caves, and sometimes solitary bats are found in an apparent state of shallow torpor in places where air temperature may fall as low as 20&#160;°C. This bat normally begins to exit the cave after dark, between 22 and 55 min after sunset (Silva-Taboada 1979). It is insectivorous, but foraging behavior has not been studied in detail.

Invasive plants including the Kudzu Vine (<em>Pueraria phaseoloides</em>) and coconut scrub from abandoned plantations threaten remaining suitable habitat for this species. Kudzu Vine threatens to overgrow roost cave entrances or to change the temperature gradient within caves (Gerlach and Taylor 2004).

Animals have been found roosting singly or in small groups of up to 12 individuals, often sharing caves with several other bat species, especially other species of <em>Hipposideros </em>(Flannery 1995, Bonaccorso 1998). It is the most robust leaf-nosed bat in Bougainville and the Solomon Islands, weighing 70-80 grams.

It is believed that <em>H. dinops</em> has undergone recent, rapid speciation, diverging from <em>H. diadema</em> in the past 1–2 million years (Lavery <em>et al.</em> 2014).","This species is likely threatened by extensive logging, particularly in the Solomon Islands, where it is estimated almost all accessible (lowland) forests have been logged (Katovai <em>et al. </em>2015). Mining may cause localised loss of habitat. Cave disturbance is also a threat, many locations are visited by hunters, and in Guadalcanal major disturbances (excavation, and fires) have been observed in caves used by this species caused by prospectors searching for rumoured treasures buried by Japanese forces in WWII.

Pennay and Lavery (2017) reported that its call was  recorded with regularity amongst free flying bats in acoustic recordings  of free flying bats on Guadalcanal and Choiseul Islands (Solomon  Islands), however these recordings were undertaken in close proximity to  caves known to be used by the species.

The number of  mature individuals in each subpopulation is estimated to be fewer than  1,000 mature individuals. The taxonomic relationships between different  island sub-populations are also complex, and each should probably be  regarded as evolutionary significant units for the genus <em>Hipposideros </em> (T. Lavery pers. comm.).<br/><br/>The population is inferred to be declining  based on observed patterns of decline in other island endemic bat  species with small geographic ranges (Lavery <em>et al.</em> 2020) and the  extensive habitat loss and degradation across the main islands in its  range. More than 40% of Bougainville’s lowland forest has been lost or  degraded over the last half century (Woxvold and Novera 2021) and  unsustainable logging in the Solomon Islands has occurred in almost all  accessible lowland rainforest (Katovai <em>et al.</em> 2015).

It has only been recorded with certainty from two  localities on Mount Nimba, one in lowland tropical moist forest (Grotte  de Blandé), and a second in Afromontane grassland (Pierré Richaud). The  bats in the Afromontane grasslands roost in the four aforementioned mine  adits (Monadjem <em>et al.</em> 2013), and possibly in some natural cave  sites that have yet to be discovered.

There is a presumed large population of <em>H. diadema</em> due to broad distribution. It is suspected to be experiencing a low-level decline due to significant habitat loss and cave disturbances throughout its range, although that decline is unlikely to be at a rate great enough to qualify the species for listing in a threatened category.</p>","<p>The species primarily roosts in caves, but has also been found roosting  in buildings, hollow trees, under palms, and underground chambers (Nowak  1999, Francis 2019). Within a crowded cave, <em>H. diadema</em> may roost on  walls or near the floor of wet caves (Bonoccorso 1998). In Australia, it  was recorded within three different cave types including fully  developed tourist caves, self-guided/underdeveloped tourist caves, and  non-tourist caves (Pavey 1998). On the Nicobar Islands, it has been  recorded in bunkers with a colony size of 20-25, as well as colony sizes  greater than 150 within caves (Aul <em>et al.</em> 2014). Maternity  colonies of 8,000 <em>H. diadema</em> have been observed in Papua New Guinea  (Bonoccorso 1998). Further, it is known to roost with other species in  colonies that may reach over 100,000 individuals (Payne <em>et al.</em> 1985). It has been recorded roosting with <em>Rhinolophus affinis</em> at a cave in Penggerukan, North Sumatra (Whitten <em>et al.</em>  2000). In the Philippines, it was found to co-exist with other species  in caves including <em>Hipposideros pygmaeus</em>, <em>Rhinolophus arcuatus</em>,  <em>Rhinolophus virgo</em>, and <em>Rousettus amplexicaudatus</em> (Nuñeza and Galorio  2014), and co-roost with <em>Pipistrellus javanicus</em> (Galorio and Nuñeza  2014). Individuals were found to use multiple day roosts but did not  change roost every day (Pavey 1998). Ectoparasite loads among <em>H. diadema</em>  was recorded to be lowest among individuals within more complex caves  and lower densities (Phelps and Kingston 2018), as close contact among  females in maternity colonies has been shows to increase parasitism  transmission (Christe <em>et al.</em> 2007).<br/><br/>It forages in various  forested habitats, including highly disturbed areas (Francis 2019). A  study in Australia found some flexibility in its foraging ecology, as  some individuals occupied up to three types of vegetation including an  open forest and vine thicket, although woodland was the most common  (Pavey 1998). However, they still required similar habitat components  among each type, specifically an area with leafless twigs for perching  overlooking an open space. Its wing morphology and high constant  echolocation frequency of 59-66kHz are more efficient for foraging in  densely vegetated habitats, as higher frequency calls rapidly attenuate  in air (Denzinger and Schnitzler 2013). Therefore, they are less  effective in locating prey in more open forests or disturbed habitats  such as coffee plantations (Kingston 2003, Meijaard 2005). According to  Huang <em>et al.</em> (2019), species similar to <em>H. diadema</em> that roost in  caves and have higher constant-frequency calls are more tolerant to  coffee plantations than plant-roosting species with lower  broadband-frequency calls. However, <em>H. diadema </em>is still less likely to  be found in an open disturbed habitat such as a coffee plantation, as  vegetation simplification decreases prey availability (Wickramasinghe <em>et al.</em>  2004), limits their echolocation efficiency and may increase predation  pressure (Gardner 1998). This hypothesis is supported in a study by  Huang <em>et al.</em> (2014) that only recorded sightings <em>H. diadema</em>  within the primary rainforests of Bukit Barisan Selatan National Park,  Sumatra, Indonesia, and only half of the sampled polyculture  plantations, while recording no sightings within the sampled disturbed  forest and monoculture plantations.<br/><br/><em>Hipposideros diadema </em>is an  insectivore, mostly feeding on Coleopterans, Lepidopterans, and  Orthopteras, however, it has also been classified as an “occasional  carnivore” that will occasionally feed on small birds and spiders (Pavey  and Burwell 1997). Samples of <em>H. diadema</em> stomach contents in Australia  consists of 78% Coleoptera and 20% Lepidoptera (Milne <em>et al.</em>2006).  In the Philippines, Galorio and Nuñeza (2014) found fruit bits in their  stomachs, suggesting they either consumed fruits or the insects  attracted to fruits, as bats can echolocate prey that are hidden on a  fruit surface (Korine and Kalko 2005). They also found bird feathers and  unidentified hair fibers within the stomachs, supporting the theory of  occasional carnivory. The species is a perch hunting species, with  continuous flight as a secondary behavior (Pavey 1998). It hangs from a  perch and scans the area using echolocation until it detects its prey  and then makes a fast, direct flight to catch it (Francis 2019). It  typically has 1-3 foraging areas with an average foraging range of  1.08km from the day roost (Pavey 1998) but can range up to 10km  (Bonoccorso 1998). It also usually goes out for 1-2 foraging bouts per  night (Pavey 1998), selecting several perches over 1km<sup>2</sup> (Francis 2019).<br/><br/>It  has a single breeding season that coincides with warmer temperatures  and the maximum quantity of insects (Nowak 1999). The females congregate  and form maternity colonies during March and April (Nowak 1998, Francis  2019). In peninsular Thailand, females with young were found in  maternity roosts in April (Monadjem <em>et al.</em> 2019). In the southern  hemisphere, dependent young and subadult <em>H. diadema </em>were also observed  in caves from April through May (Bonoccorso 1998). The females give  birth to a single pup and may carry it until it becomes independent  enough to fly and feed alone or leave it within the roost when searching  for food. Within the Bismarck Archipelago, lactating females are known  to carry infants from June through October (Bonoccorso 1998). A young <em>H.  diadema </em>will reach sexual maturity after about one year (Nowak 1999).  It has an average life span of about four to seven years but can live up  to twelve years in captivity (Nowak 1999).&#160;</p>","<p>Human disturbance and habitat loss (e.g., cave roosts and forest  foraging habitats) are the leading threats to <em>H. diadema </em>populations.  Caves are the preferred roost site for <em>H. diadema</em> and are highly  vulnerable to threats compared to any land resource (Galorio and Nuñeza  2014). Such threats include limestone extraction, tourism, guano  extraction, and cave swiftlet nests (Galorio and Nuñeza 2014, Kingston  2010). Destruction/disturbance of mines has also been shown to  significantly threaten cave-roosting species such as <em>H. diadema</em> (Hall <em>et al.</em> 1997).<br/><br/>Within Southeast Asia, as much of 74% of forest may be lost by the year 2100 (Sodhi <em>et al.</em>  2004). Singapore has lost 95% of its primary forest since the 1800s  with an estimated bat species loss of about 70% (Corlett 1992, Lane <em>et al.</em>  2006). Similarly, the rate of deforestation in Southeast Sulawesi was  41,814 ha/year in 1985–1997 (Kuhutanan 2002). Throughout all of  Indonesia, the Global Forest Watch reports 27Mha of tree cover loss  between 2001-2019 including more than 9.5Mha of humid primary forest,  further limiting bat species to protected areas (2021). <em>Hipposideros  diadema</em> remains flexible in its utilized foraging habitats, including  within highly disturbed areas (Francis 2019). However, the species is  still less likely to be found in disturbed habitats and monoculture  plantations (Huang <em>et al.</em> 2014) as it is not suited for  simplified vegetation, and the expansion of coffee agriculture and other  plantations have been shown to significantly reduce both bat abundance  and richness (Huang <em>et al.</em> 2019). The increase of such activity  will also likely further increase the disturbance of nearby caves, which  remains the leading threat to <em>H. diadema</em> populations. Furthermore,  simultaneous or continuous stressors, such as habitat loss and human  disturbance, can increase vulnerability to pathogens and parasites  (Phelps and Kingston 2018). Transmission of parasites through  consumption of scavenger insects has also been observed within <em>H.  diadema</em> and could post a risk to other population members (Galorio and  Nuñeza 2014).</p>","<p>Data are limited on the species population size and trend. There is a  presumed large population size that is suspected to be experiencing a  low-level population decline due to significant habitat loss and cave  disturbance. It can be locally common on the Nicobar Islands where  colonies of up to 500 bats have been documented (Aul and Vijaykumar  2003, Aul <em>et al.</em> 2014). Furthermore, maternity colonies (females  and young) of ca 8,000<em> H. diadema</em> have been observed in Papua New Guinea  (Bonoccorso 1998).<br/><br/>There are 15 subspecies recognized, four of  which are found in Papua New Guinea (Bonaccorso 1998).

The population decline is continuing due to loss of some previously known roosts, confirmed occupancy of only one out of 35 caves assessed in Nigeria, the limited availability of undisturbed roosts, the species being limited by quality forest, and ongoing deforestation within its range significantly reducing the area of occupancy.","This species is heavily dependent on undisturbed caves and lowland  rainforest. It forages in the forest understory and is rarely caught  outside forests (Perret and Allen 1956). Only a single record is known  from human residence – government rest house at Mamfe (Sanderson 1940),  which may have been well-lit and thus likely to have attracted insects,  that in turn potentially attracted the bat.

Furthermore, within a sampling area of <em>ca</em> 1 km², the  species was only encountered in very close proximity to cave-like  boulders, demonstrating its dependence on appropriate roosting sites and  possibly small home ranges.

A  search of 35 cave-like boulder roosts in Afi Mountain Wildlife Sanctuary  and Cross River National Park (both in Nigeria), yielded just one  roosting group of <em>H. curtus</em>, the lack of additional groups is thought to  be due to the nature and intensity of fruit bat hunting that currently  goes on at these parks.","This is a rarely encountered species that had not been captured or observed in the wild since the 1970s until recent surveys conducted in Nigeria (I.

Along the  coast, it roosts colonially in coral reef caves in remnant coastal  forests but likely to forage in adjacent scrublands and plantations  (McWilliam and Happold 2013). The species usually roosts adjacent to or  together with <em>Coleura afra</em>,&#160;<em>Miniopterus minor</em>, <em>Rousettus aegyptiacus</em>,  <em>Triaenops afer</em>, <em>Macronycteris gigas</em>, <em>M. vittata</em>, <em>Hipposideros caffer</em> and <em> Cloeotis percivali</em> (McWilliam and Happold 2013, Makori 2015, Musila <em>et al.</em> 2019).<br/><em><br/>Taphozous  hildegardeae </em>is insectivorous, feeding on Orthoptera and Lepidoptera  and seasonal variation in insect prey has been observed (McWilliam and  Happold 2013).

There have been reports of pronounced delay in  giving birth, with some females still pregnant in late January or early  February, following a severe dry season when body condition in females  likely to be very poor and linked to delayed implantation (McWilliam and  Happold 2013).","This species is endemic to Kenya and Tanzania, with a small geographic range. Disturbance, including tourism and recreational activities of the coral caves on which it depends, and loss of forest habitat along the coastal strip, could result in population declines. Because the roost sites in coral caves are on unprotected community lands, at least in Kenya, this in itself is a threat because the future of these caves is uncertain. The land on which these caves are located are at risk of being converted to farmlands and the caves being closed off or destroyed.","The overall global population is thought to be declining due to cave  roost and forest degradation and loss.

A few  individuals in the hundreds are also resident at the historical Shimoni  Slave Cave on Kenya’s south coast.<br/><br/>Therefore, Kenyan populations at  northern and southern coastal Kenya are probably stable at the moment.  However, as these caves are unprotected on private and community lands  they are at great risk of development and loss. Two large populations in  coastal Kenya were estimated at about 1,000 to 2,000 individuals  (McWilliam and Happold 2013).

Some bats require stable, highly insulated environments in order to hibernate. <em>Eptesicus fuscus</em> has a more tolerant constitution so it can winter in less substantial structures. Besides human dwellings, it has been found to take up residence in barns, silos, and churches. Also, this bat has been found roosting in storm sewers, expansion joint spaces in concrete athletic stadiums, and copper mines (Baker 1983). In pre-settlement times it is presumed the big brown bat roosted in tree hollows, natural caves, or openings in rock ledges. Occasionally groups of these bats are still found living in tree cavities (Baker 1983). Recently, some were found hibernating in caves in Minnesota (Knowles 1992).<br/>The big brown bat hibernates in various structures, either man-made or natural environments. They prefer cool temperatures and can tolerate conditions many other bats cannot. They may become active during their winter hibernacula and can move to an optimum habitat. One banded bat was recorded to have moved to a different cave 400 yards away, during the same winter (Goehring 1972).<br/><em>Eptesicus fuscus</em> is an insectivorous bat. It preys primarily on beetles using its robust skull and powerful jaws to chew through the beetles' hard chitinous exoskeleton. It also eats other flying insects including moths, flies, wasps, flying ants, lacewing flies, and dragonflies (Baker 1983). One study indicated that juvenile <em>E. fuscus</em> ate a greater range of softer food items in their diets, compared to adults. The same study also indicated that bats having survived their first winter (yearlings), did not differ significantly in diet from the adults (Hamilton and Barclay 1998).",Big Brown Bats are fairly common and are not of any special conservation concern.,It is reasonable to speculate that populations of the big brown bat have increased with an increasing number of human habitations (Baker 1983). Big brown bats can survive up to 19 years in the wild and males tend to live longer than females. Most big brown bats die in their first winter. If they do not store enough fat to make it through their entire hibernation period then they die in their winter roost. Female big brown bats form maternity colonies to rear young. The size of these colonies can vary from 5 to 700 animals. Males of the species roost alone or in small groups during this time. Both sexes will roost together again in the late summer (Nowak 1999).,Increasing,"The Big Brown bat is found from southern Canada to Colombia and Venezuela; Greater Antilles; Bahamas; Hispaniola, Dominica and Barbados (Lesser Antilles), also in Alaska (Simmons 2005).

The typical day roost for the bat is behind loose tree bark. These bats appear to be particularly fond of willow, maple and ash trees (most likely due to the deeply fissured bark). Hollow snags and bird nests also provide daytime roosting areas for silver-haired bats. Less common daytime roosts include buildings, such as open sheds and garages; however, due to their solitary nature and adaptation to woodland roosts, these bats rarely invade buildings in large enough numbers to cause alarm. During the winter months, silver-haired bats that hibernate find shelter in northern areas inside trees, buildings, rock crevices, and similar protected structures (Kunz 1982, Wilson and Ruff 1999).<br/>Silver-haired bats are insectivorous. Their diet mainly consists of flies, beetles, and moths. However, these bats feed opportunistically on any concentration of insects they come across. They have a short-range foraging strategy, traveling over woodland ponds and streams. Silver-haired bats do not always feed in mid-flight; they have been caught in mouse traps, suggesting ground foraging, and they have been reported to consume larvae on trees (Kunz 1982). Silver-haired bats have been reported to be one of the earliest fliers in the evening, sometimes appearing in broad daylight. However, other sources claim that these bats show nightly foraging activity, with one peak of activity before midnight and another before sunrise. The flying time of silver-haired bats is believed to be adjusted by the bat so that it will not conflict with the flying times of the red, hoary, or big brown bats (Kunz 1982, Wilson and Ruff 1999).During the summer, the bats are believed to segregate by sex. During late summer and autumn, however, silver-haired bats join in groups containing both sexes to migrate to the southern parts of their range (Van Gelder and Wingate 1961). Some individuals are also known to hibernate in the northern locations (Kunz 1982). Courtship and mating of silver-haired bats occurs in autumn when both sexes congregate for migration. Fertilization is delayed until the next spring. Births occur after a gestation period of 50 to 60 days. Two young are produced, usually between late June and early July (Kunz 1982).","Silver-haired Bats have no special endangered or threatened status; however, activities such as logging and deforestation may pose a threat for the bat in the future, by reducing roosting sites available (Kunz 1982).","During warm months, individuals and small groups can be found roosting in hollow trees, beneath exfoliating bark, and sometimes beneath rocks. Females are known to form small maternity colonies. Although considered to be relatively common during summer months, relatively few individuals have been observed in winter (Wilson and Ruff 1999). It is rare in Mexico, the Gulf states, Texas and southern California (Wilson and Ruff 1999).&#160;The silver-haired bat is probably regular on both migrations to Bermuda, but varies&#160;in numbers from year to year (Van Gelder and Wingate 1961).",Stable,"The Silver-haired Bat occurs throughout most of the contiguous southern Canada and USA (including SE Alaska, and except extreme southern parts), also in NE Mexico, and Bermuda (Wilson and Ruff 1999, Simmons 2005).",,Terrestrial,"This bat is found in several protected areas throughout its geographic distribution.

Although it has a presumed large population, occurrence in a number of protected areas, and certain tolerance to some degree of habitat modification, the impact of this disease has been extremely severe for eastern North American bats, especially those with large hibernating roosts.","Eastern Pipistrelles can be found in open woods near the edges of water, as well as over water. They are not usually found in open fields or deep forests (Schmidly 1991, Nowak 1999). They roost in rock crevices, caves, buildings, and tree foliage in the summer. During the winter, caves, mines, and deep crevices serve as hibernacula (Briggler and Prather 2003, Sandel <em><em>et al.</em></em>&#160;2001). Eastern Pipistrelles copulate between August and October while “swarming” in front of cave openings. This is the only time the sexes of this species are together- during this time females mate with multiple males (Whitaker and Hamilton 1998). Eastern Pipistrelles are insectivores and are considered generalists (Hamlin and Myers 2004), they forage most commonly over waterways and at forest edges, analyses of stomach content reveals that its diet is composed of Coleoptera, Homoptera, Diptera, Hymenoptera and Lepidoptera (Fujita and Kunz 1984).<br/><br/>Eastern Pipistrelles are sporadic flyers with a short elliptical flight pattern (Patterson and Hardin 1969). They show a slow, erratic and fluttery flight while foraging (Fujita and Kunz 1984), and are often confused for moths (Whitaker and Hamilton 1998).","Recently, the white-nose syndrome (WNS) is becoming the major threat to hibernating bats&#160; in caves (hibernacula) and a number of studies have called the attention that the spread of this disease can extirpate whole caves from the distribution range for some species, including <em>P</em><em>. subflavus&#160;</em>(Alves&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014). Also, with populations of many cave-hibernating bat species in eastern North America declining as a result of WNS, it is increasingly critical to understand relationships among bats&#160;and forest-management activities.&#160;This species is known to have very specific requirements for roosts on trees. Some studies indicate this species could be affected by wind turbines for generation of energy along part of its distribution.","<em>Perimyotis subflavus</em> is locally abundant in caves during winter but its summer habits are poorly known (Wilson and Ruff 1999). Eastern Pipistrelles have a lifespan of 4 to 8 years in the wild, with the oldest&#160;known record being&#160;14.8 years. (Nowak 1999, Whitaker and Hamilton 1998) Eastern Pipistrelles are obligate hibernators, in warmer climates they hibernate even though food is available (Briggler and Prather 2003). They enter the hibernaculum in late July-October and leave at the beginning of April (Fujita and Kunz 1984). They hibernate in the deepest part of the hibernaculum where temperatures are stable (Schmidly 1991). Hibernating colonies can consist of several thousand individuals, sometimes they share a hibernaculum with other local species (Wilson and Ruff 1999). Eastern Pipistrelles generally hibernate individually, but groups of 2 or 3 have been observed in Texas caves (Sandel <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2001). Eastern pipistrelles might choose hibercula based on the closeness to and abundance of forests available to them (Sandel <em>et al</em>. 2001). They also prefer hibernacula with east-facing openings (Briggler and Prather 2003). During the summer, female <em>P. subflavus</em> roost in maternity colonies with an average of 15 individuals. Males roost alone (Whitaker 1998).<br/><br/>The potential impact of WNS on eastern North American bats (Alves&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014) suggests a pessimistic scenario for&#160;<em>P. subflavus</em>, which will probably be affected with over 60% of population decline, and could be considered as Endangered (EN) or, if the impact is not so severe, as Vulnerable (VU).

Several caves in central Mexico were known to contain considerable numbers in the past but now contain only small colonies or none at all, a similar situation occurs at the major colony in Texas (USFWS 2000).&#160;Major threats include disturbance of roosts (individuals often quickly take flight upon human entry, Wilson 1985), loss of food sources through clearing of land for agriculture and human exploitation of agaves. All these threats have proved to be significant factors in its decline. A population reduction is&#160;suspected to have been greater than 50% over the past three generations (15-18 years, Pacifici <em>et al.</em> 2013) as a direct result of local extinctions and habitat loss. More data and population monitoring are required for this species, and a reassessment is recommended as soon as additional information becomes available.","Habitats include desert scrub, open conifer-oak woodlands and pine forests in the Upper Sonoran and Transition Life Zones, generally arid areas where agave plants are present (USFWS 2000).&#160;This species usually favours higher and cooler regions than <em>L. yerbabuenae</em> (Arita 1991).&#160;Roosting habitat requirements are not well known.&#160;It usually roosts in large groups (up to 10,000) in caves or mines, occasionally found in buildings, hollow trees or culverts. It emerges well after sunset and feeds on pollen and nectar, principally of agaves and various cacti. <em>Pseudobombax, Ceiba, Ipomoea, Calliandra, Pinus</em>, and grasses are also important food sources in Central Mexico (Gardner 1977). Fruit and insects are sometimes taken; 173 samples contained insect parts in central México (Sánchez and Medellín 2007). Northern subpopulations migrate south in winter; numbers found in caves fluctuate greatly from year to year, indicating eruptive movements in addition to seasonal migration. A single young is born in May or June (Hensley and Wilkins 1988, Reid 1997).","Primary threats include disturbance of roosts, loss of food sources through clearing of land for agriculture and human exploitation of agaves (e.g., for production of alcoholic beverages), and direct killing by humans. Other threats may include negative effects of ingestion of pesticides applied to plants, competition for roosts and nectar, natural catastrophes, disease and predation; however, these are not believed to be major limiting factors, though some of them could become significant for subpopulations reduced to small size by other factors (see USFWS 2000). <br/><br/>These bats are sensitive to disturbance in their roosting sites (they often quickly take flight upon human entry; Wilson 1985) and, in general, roosting caves are becoming increasingly subject to human destruction and disturbance. Human disturbance and destruction of roost sites is a common occurrence in Mexico. The availability of roost sites free from disturbance may be a significant limiting factor. Special precautions should be taken when mine and cave surveys are conducted. In June and July when the young are very small, disturbance can cause them to lose their grasp on the rock and fall to their death. During hibernation, disturbance will cause an increase in metabolism; this use of fat reserves may cause starvation prior to spring (New Mexico Department of Game and Fish 1996). A major problem for bats all over Mexico is that uninformed citizens frequently destroy all bats in a roost, believing them to be vampire bats. <br/><br/>Foraging habitat can be degraded or destroyed by harvesting of agave (an important food resource). Although it has been estimated that bootleg mescal makers are eliminating between 500,00 and 1,200,000 wild paniculate agave a year in Sonora alone, there is no clear support for such a statement. Agave plant parts are harvested just before they bloom; this prevents flowering and can prevent reproduction by the affected plant (an agave plant grows for 10 to 20 years, flowers only once, then dies). However, there are few places in Sonora or elsewhere in Mexico where wild Agave harvesting has eliminated a significant percentage of nectar-producing genets, and plants harvested by indigenous people generally produce vegetative offshoots that may eventually produce flowers (Nabhan and Fleming 1993). Populations of unharvested plants persist in many areas that are not easily accessible to humans. The negative impact of agave harvest probably is not as great as was previously believed. On the other hand, reduced pollination resulting from decreased bat populations may eventually lead to a reduction in agave distribution and abundance. <br/><br/>Some foraging habitat has been degraded or destroyed by expansion of agriculture and other land uses. Large areas of both the Sierra Madre Oriental and Sierra Madre Occidental and the Mexican Plateau have been converted to agriculture or rangeland. <br/><br/>This species may experience predation from owls, hawks, snakes and mammals, but natural levels of predation likely are inconsequential to the overall status of the species. However, increased populations of domestic and feral cats and other predators near human habitations may affect the survival of colonies, particularly maternity colonies (USFWS 2000).","This bat is uncommon or rare (Reid 1997). The number of occurrences or subpopulations is unknown but probably exceeds 20; Arita (1991) mapped a few dozen collection sites in Mexico. One known colonial roosting site exists in the United States, which has shown large declines in the past (Matthews and Moseley 1990), but there could be one or more additional sites that have not yet been detected. The number of occurrences or subpopulations with good viability is unknown but likely there are not very many. Several caves in central Mexico were known to contain considerable numbers in the past but now contain only small colonies or none at all (see USFWS 2000). It is probably declining in number of occurrences or subpopulations and  in overall population size, but the rate of decline is unknown and  better information is need. The only mating roost has been declining but  is now protected.<br/><br/>There is a single known U.S. roost at  Emory Peak (a cave in Big Bend National Park,&#160;Texas), which&#160;fluctuates widely from year to year (zero to 10,000+ individuals): 10,650 bats in 1967, 5,000 in 1968, 3,900  in 1969, zero in 1970, 8,025 in 1971, 1,000 in 1983, 4,942-5,990 in  1988, over 5,000 in 1991, zero in 1992, and 2,859 in 1993 (Matthews and  Moseley 1990, see USFWS 2000). No significant trend can be ascertained from these data,  which are the best available for the species. Reasons for the  fluctuations are not understood, but they could reflect annual  variations in food resources in different parts of the range (USFWS  2000).&#160;Fluctuation may be in part due to some counts being made before  or after the main period of bat occupation of the cave (Cockrum and  Petryszyn 1991). The Texas subpopulation may be a ""spill-over"" colony  present during years of high population or reduced food supply. <br/><br/>Sánchez and Medellín (2007) estimated the  colony at Cueva del Diablo, Morelos, central Mexico, at 3,000  individuals, while López (2010) estimated the same colony at 4,000. Both  estimates were done visually under the supervision of the same  individual (R. Medellin) and during the winter months, the only time of  the year this species remains in the area. Arita and Prado rated this  species as widespread and scarce in Mexico. See  Arita (1993) for general information on conservation status and  population size in Mexico. <br/><br/>The long-term trend  is unclear. The extent of occurrence (EOO) and area of occupancy (AOO)  probably have not changed much, but the habitat quality, the number of occurrences or  subpopulations and population size may have dramatically decreased in  some sites during the last three decades. Wilson <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em>  (1985) found that this species was either completely absent or present  in reduced numbers in known roosts. The number of bats found represented  only a fraction of the total reported in previous studies. For example,  in an abandoned mine in Nuevo Leon, Mexico, where an estimated  population of 10,000 was observed in 1938, no individuals of <em>L. nivalis</em>  were found in 1983 (Wilson 1985). Another mine in Nuevo Leon had a  ceiling covered with newborn bats in 1967, but only one bat was found in  1983. A few other roosts had reduced numbers of bats compared to  findings during previous surveys. These changes could indicate a decline  in the overall population, but they might reflect movement of bats  among different roosting sites in different years, or they could result  from seasonal changes in bat distribution (survey dates varied).",Decreasing,"This species is known from southeast Arizona, south New Mexico and southwest Texas (USA) to south Mexico and Guatemala (Simmons 2005). However, there is no evidence of this species being present south of Guerrero, Mexico (R.

It generally occurs from lowlands to 3,500 m asl (mostly 1,000 to 2,200 m asl, Reid 1997).<br/><br/>The range includes medium to high elevations in northern and central Mexico, southwestern Texas (southern Brewster and Presidio counties), and southwestern New Mexico, at elevations of about 500 to 3,500 m asl. Most occurrences in Mexico are at elevations of 1,000 to 2,200 m asl, but this bat been captured at an elevation of 3,780 m asl (Arita 1991), and the type specimen was caught near snow line at 17,816 feet (5,747 m asl) on Mt.

The only colonial roost in the U.S. is a cave at Emory Peak, at an elevation of 2,290 m asl, in the Chisos Mountains, Texas. Simmons (2005) described the range of <em>L. nivalis</em> as extending to southern Mexico and Guatemala, and she also included southeastern Arizona in the range.

Although data are limited as the species is rarely captured, the species decline is thought to result from the extent of disturbance at their cave roosts, loss of karst habitats, and the overall extensive forest loss and degradation on Borneo.","<em>Eonycteris major</em> roosts in limestone caves throughout its range and has  been recorded from sea level to <em>ca</em> 1,300 m near Borneo Highlands in  Sarawak (Lim 1965, Mohd-Azlan <em>et al.</em>&#160;2006). It is thought to be a  canopy species as is infrequently encountered in bat surveys conducted  in the forest understory. The species occurs across a range of forested  habitats, from mixed lowland dipterocarp forest (e.g., near Loagan Bunut  National Park) to lower montane forest near Borneo Highlands  (Mohd-Azlan <em>et al.</em>&#160;2006, Jayaraj <em>et al.</em>&#160;2011). <br/><br/>The species has been captured in an orchard within Sungai Dewata (Pounsin <em>et al.</em>  2016) and has been collected in banana mixed garden habitats close to  caves (A. Suyanto pers. comm.). While the species has been historically  captured in heavily modified agricultural landscapes (e.g., rice fields  and rubber plantations at Kampung Pangkalan Kuap South of Kuching, Lim  1965), more recent research has only documented it at the interface  between forests and oil palm plantations (Mohd-Azlan <em>et al.</em> 2019) or in forests adjacent to oil palm plantations near Lambir Hills National Park (LHNP), Sarawak, Malaysia (Fukuda <em>et al.</em>  2009). It has also been documented (three individuals) in regenerated  montane forests (1,000 m) at Mount Penrisen, Padawan (Jayaraj <em>et al.</em>  2011). Notably, 16 individuals (five male, 11 female) were captured at Kolej  Universiti Sains Malaysia which was built on recovered mangrove land  (Fadhullah and Ho 2013). Conversely, only three (3) individuals were  confirmed at the Crocker Range Biosphere Reserve, one in the biosphere’s  buffer and two in extralimital agricultural landscapes (Yoh <em>et al.</em>  2020). Additional research on the species habitat associations,  especially with primary forests across an elevational gradient is  warranted.","The full extent of threats to <em>E. major</em> is unknown as the species is  rarely encountered in most surveys, and it is only encountered in low  numbers across a range of habitats. Exploitation of roosting caves  (guano mining, general visitation) and the mining of limestone karst  areas likely pose a significant threat to the species’ roosts given the  species dependence on them.<br/><br/>Forest loss is assumed to be the most  significant threat to <em>E. major</em> on Borneo as 24% of Borneo’s primary  forests had been lost by 1973 (Gaveau <em>et al.</em> 2017) and only half of it today (<a rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"" href=""https://www.unenvironment.org/news-and-stories/story/deforestation-borneo-slowing-regulation-remains-key"">https://www.unenvironment.org/news-and-stories/story/deforestation-borneo-slowing-regulation-remains-key</a>). While the rate of lost is decreasing, primary forest loss between 2000 and 2017 was 14%, resulting in a 170% increase in oil palm plantations  (Gaveau <em>et al.</em> 2019).<br/><br/>This species is hunted for local  consumption in some portions of Borneo (A. Suyanto pers. comm.), but the  full extent and impact to the species populations is uncertain. The  species is not thought to be hunted in Sarawak.","The species is considered to be an uncommon species that is rarely  captured across Borneo. It is inconsistently documented even in areas  where it has previously been captured (Tuen <em>et al.</em>&#160;2003, Faisal <em>et al.</em>&#160;2007, Wiantoro <em>et al.</em> 2009, Jayaraj <em>et al.</em>  2011). For example, only five individuals of <em>E. major</em> were captured during one  of three separate projects at Mount Murad during the 2000s (Tuen <em>et al.</em>, 2003, Faisal <em>et al.</em>&#160;2007, Wiantoro <em>et al.</em>  2009). Given exploitation of the species, extent of cave disturbance, and  forest loss and degradation on Borneo, its global population is suspected to have declined by a rate of 25–29% over the past 12.9 years  (three generations, GL = 4.3 years; Pacifici <em>et al.</em>&#160;2013).",Unknown,"<em>Eonycteris major </em>is endemic to Borneo and has been documented in Brunei,  Indonesia, and Malayasia.

22128326,7787,Eonycteris spelaea,Least Concern,,2020,2020-07-20 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<em>Eonycteris spelaea is l</em>isted as Least Concern in view of its wide distribution, presumed large population, it occurs in a number of protected areas, has a tolerance of a degree of habitat modification, and because it is unlikely to be declining fast enough to qualify for listing in a more threatened category.","<p>This is a nectarivorous cave roosting species that forms compact  clusters forming large colonies consisting of hundreds to tens of  thousands of individuals. It can also form small colonies or join  colonies of different species (e.g., <em>Rousettus amplexicaudatus</em>). Its  preferred shelter are caves in forested habitat, but can be found in a  variety of habitats and have been observed utilizing man-made structures  such as: mines (Mickleburgh <em>et al.</em> 1992, Furey <em>et al.</em>  2011), the attics of village huts (Tarapada Bhattacharyya pers. comm.  June 2005, Khim Maung Swe pers. comm. January 2000), the basement of a  high-rise building (Lim 2015), and beneath a high vehicular bridge. A  study in Mindanao, Philippines observed use of caves located near water  that have large openings and multiple entry points (Tanalgo and Tabora  2015). Within the cave, this species prefers to cling to walls in areas  of partial illumination (Tanalgo and Tabora 2015). In addition, it is  known to roost high in the ceilings of caves in Thailand (Acharya Pers.  obs. 2019).<br/><br/>The species has high aspect ratio wings and high wing  loading capacity, making it a strong flyer capable of long-distance  flight (Chakravarty <em>et al.</em> 2018). Individuals fly many kilometers  in search of food each night and the longest foraging distance is from  Malaysia was inferred to be ca 38 km based on finding of mangrove pollen  at a land locked roost site (Start and Marshall 1974). Since then,  radio telemetry has provided more insight to nightly foraging distances.  The longest observed distance from study out of southern Thailand was  17.9 km, only half of the historical estimate (Acharya <em>et al.</em>  2015a). Nightly foraging distance has been found to correlate with roost  size, the larger the roost, the longer the foraging distance. A study  conducted in southern Thailand exemplifies this as bats from the largest  roost were recorded traveling farther than those in smaller roosts  (Acharya <em>et al.</em> 2015a). Although day roosting in large colonies  may be beneficial, these colonies create increased competition for  resources, hence the need to forage farther from the roost site (Fleming  1982, Wilkinson 1992).<br/><br/><em>Eonycteris spelaea </em>is known to forage in  agricultural areas, primary forest, secondary forest, and coastal  mangroves (Smith and Xie 2008, Thavry <em>et al.</em> 2017). It forages individually or in small groups by landing on a flower for 2-3 seconds at a time (Acharya <em>et al.</em>  2015b). It is a generalist, taking advantage of any available food  sources (Stewart and Dudash 2018), and is the most common pollinator of  many chiropterophilous plant species in Southeast Asia (Gould 1978; Bumrungsri <em>et al.</em> 2009; Sritongchuay <em>et al.</em> 2008; Stewart and Dudash 2016; Acharya 2015a,b). Its diet varies across its distribution: it has been found to feed on 55 plant species in Malaysia (Lim <em>et al.</em> 2018), 19 plant species in Thailand (Pakarnseree 1986), 13 plant species in Cambodia (Thavry <em>et al.</em> 2017), and 18 plant species in China (Yunnan Province and Jinjhong City, Yang <em>et al.</em>  2017). Across its range. E. spelaea provides significant ecological  services as it pollinates coastal mangroves, primary forests, and many  economically important crops including durian (Durio zibethinus), tree  bean (Parkia timoriana) and petai (<em>P. speciosa</em>, Harbit <em>et al.</em> 2008, Sritongchuay et al 2008, Bumrungsri <em>et al.</em> 2009, Bumrungsri <em>et al.</em> 2013, Nor Zalipah <em>et al.</em> 2016, Stewart and Dudash 2016, Thavry <em>et al.</em> 2017).<br/><br/>Reproduction occurs year-round and is often observed correlating with blooms of certain food sources (Bumrungsri <em>et al.</em> 2013, Heideman and Utzurrum 2003). Females produce one offspring (with which they can fly) per year (Bates and Harrison 1997).<br/><br/>It  is not known to migrate seasonally as it is a generalist and switches  food sources throughout the year. However, this may vary with location  as in Xishuangbanna, China, about 1,000 individuals were found roosting  in a cave with about 600 <em>Rousettus leschenaulti</em> in the winter with both  species vacating the cave during the reproductive period, which  corresponded to when the cave was occupied by <em>Chaerephon plicata</em> (Zhang <em>et al.</em> 2010).<br/><br/>There  is evidence of significant sexual dimorphism in this species with the  males (55.0-82.0 g) being larger than females (35.0-78.0 g, Rahman and  Chaudhury 2017). It exhibits physical adaptations for nectar feeding  including a long muzzle and sharply pointed tongue, with well-developed  filiform papillae at the tip (Bumrungsri et al 2013). Their ears are  simple and they do not have a tragus. The dorsal pelage is brown and the  ventral is pale in color, males have longer and darker fur around the  neck than females (Rahman and Chaudhurry 2017). The species two  distinguishing features including large, kidney shaped glands on either  side of the anus (Nameer <em>et al.</em> 2016) and has no claw on its second digit (Atmoko and Nugroho 2013).</p>","Throughout its range, this species is threatened by at least one of the  following: habitat loss, cave disturbance, bushmeat hunting, quarrying,  lack of legal protection or enforcement of existing protection, and  persecution from a lack of education among locals.<br/><br/><strong>Habitat Loss</strong>:  This species is pressured by the loss of both roosting and foraging  habitat, both of which are impacted by human development (Achondo <em>et al.</em> 2014; Bumrungsri <em>et al.</em> 2009, 2013; Fukuda <em>et al.</em> 2009; Furey 2011; Kingston 2010; Lim 2015; Maryanto and Irawati 2015; Phelps 2016; Rahman <em>et al.</em> 2018; Tanalgo <em>et al.</em> 2014, 2016; Tanalgo and Tabora 2015; Zhang <em>et al.</em>  2010). For example, between 1990 and 2010, Peninsular Malaysia lost  8.6% (or 1,920,000 hectares) of its forest cover (Lim 2015).  Additionally, quarrying is resulting in the isolation and loss of  limestone karst features (Acharya 2015b; Harbit <em>et al.</em> 2008; Fukuda 2009; Kingston 2010; Phelps <em>et al.</em> 2016; Zhang 2010).<br/><br/><strong>Cave  Disturbance</strong>: Cave disturbance is common and widespread, often causing  significant population declines. Documented sources of cave disturbance  include guano mining, limestone quarrying, opportunistic recreation,  tourism, and religious practices (Hall <em>et al.</em> 2002; Heideman and Utzurrum 2003; Harbit <em>et al.</em> 2008; Fukuda 2009; Zhang 2010; Kingston 2010; Furey 2011; Bumrungsri <em>et al.</em> 2013; Mould 2012; Acharya 2015bandc; Tanalgo and Tabora 2015; Phelps <em>et al.</em> 2016; Roslan <em>et al.</em> 2016; Tanalgo <em>et al.</em> 2014, 2016; Rahman and Chaudhury 2017; Thavry <em>et al.</em> 2017; Yang <em>et al.</em> 2017; Rahman <em>et al.</em>  2018). Cave disturbance, if the cave itself is not destroyed, has been  correlated to population declines in monitored locations. For example,  Khao Kao Cave in southern Thailand was reported to have 20,000  individuals in 2003 but declined to 500 by 2008 due to human mining of  surface soil; once disturbance subsided, the population returned to the  thousands but has yet to recover its original size (S. Bumrungsri Pers  comm 2019). In Malaysia, Batu Caves has also seen population declines as  it is a popular Hindu shrine (Start and Marshall 1976; Beck and Lim  1972; Gould 1988). “Threats to the species also appear to worsen around  April (the Khmer new-year) each year and awareness of the pollination  services it provides is non-existent among the public, including durian  farmers” (Thavry <em>et al.</em> 2017).<br/><br/><strong>Hunting and Trapping</strong>: It is  hunted for bushmeat in many countries as well as being killed by  farmers who believe they are harming their crops (Hall <em>et al.</em> 2002; Harbit <em>et al.</em> 2008; Smith and Xie 2008; Sritongchuay <em>et al.</em> 2008; Bumrungsri <em>et al.</em> 2009, 2013; Furey 2011; Fukuda 2009; Kingston 2010; Zhang <em>et al.</em> 2010; Maryanto <em>et al.</em> 2011; Mould 2012; Rahman and Chaudhruy 2017; Tanalgo <em>et al.</em>  2014, 2016; Acharya 2015bc; Tanalgo and Tabora 2015; Rahman <em>et al.</em>&#160; 2018). Their affinity to roost in huge colonies, near the openings of  caves, and in caves with many entrances makes them easy to hunt (Tanalgo  and Tabora 2015). Hunters use a variety of techniques to hunt the bats,  some as simple as netting a cave entrance while others involve flushing  the colony using fire and other disruptive behaviors. It is persecuted  by farmers due to the misconception that the bats damage crops when to  the contrary they are beneficial pollinators. Bat killings by farmers in  their mixed fruit orchards through netting is a major threat to some  cave colonies in Southern Thailand (Acharya Pers. Obs 2019).<br/><br/><strong>Lack  of Protection</strong>: There is a lack of legal protection or enforcement of  existing protection as well as unjustified persecution (stemming from a  lack of education) among locals. Lack of education among local people  results in the unnecessary killing of this species. It is a widespread  misconception that this species is a pest, often believed to harm crops.  In South Asia, including China (Zhang 2010), it is considered vermin  under Schedule V of the Indian Wildlife (Protection) Act.<p></p>","<em>Eonycteris spelaea</em> is a widespread species that is commonly encountered.  Its global population is declining due to extensive disturbance in its  roosts from hunting, mining, and numerous other threats; a lack of  consistent monitoring makes accurate population estimates difficult.<br/>It  is a colonial roosting species that can congregate in large colonies,  few of which are known relative to its large distribution. On Palawan  Island, Philippines, a colony that probably exceeded 50,000 individuals  was reported (Esselstyn <em>et al.</em> 2004); the current status is  unknown. The two largest colonies documented within the last decade are  in a cave with limited disturbance in Ban Na-San district of Surat Thani  Province, Thailand, with an estimated 30,000 individuals (Acharya  2015a) and a cave in East Java with an estimated 40,000 individuals  (Bagus, 2010, unpublished data; Maharadatunkasmi <em>et al.</em> 2003).  More recently, Khao Kao Cave in southern Thailand was reported to have  20,000 individuals in 2003, but declined to ca. 500 individuals by 2008  due to human disturbance; the population has increased to a few thousand  following restrictions to in human activity in the caves (Bumrungsri,  unpublished data/pers. obs). The disturbed Batu caves of Malaysia were  reported to contain &gt;10,000 individuals (Start and Marshall 1976),  but more recent estimates state &gt;4,000 individuals (Beck and Lim  1972, Gould 1988). Otherwise, all colony population estimates reported  in the last decade contain ca 2,000 or fewer individuals . In Cambodia  the Bat Khteas cave is reported to contain 1,000-1,400 individuals  (Thavry <em>et al.</em> 2017).<br/><br/>There are limited historical  accounts reporting large colonies and of these, very few populations  have been monitored over time; those that were monitored through time  show declines. Further, there are multiple informal reports of local  population declines in caves, either through primary observation or  current evidence indicating larger populations in the past.",Decreasing,"The range of<em> Eonycteris spelaea</em> includes nearly all of Southeast Asia,  southern China, and extends west through both northwestern and southern  South Asia.<br/><br/>In Southeast Asia it is known from: the Philippines,  Indonesia, East and West Malaysia, Brunei, Singapore, Vietnam, Cambodia,  Laos, Thailand, and Myanmar.<br/><br/>In the Philippines it is found throughout the country including from: Biliran, Bohol (Phelps <em>et al.</em>  2016), Camotes (Paguntalan pers. comm. 2006), Carabro (Alcala and  Alviola 1970), Catanduanes, Cebu, Danjugan (Carino 2004; O’Malley <em>et al.</em>  2006), Ilin (Gonzalez pers. comm. 2006); Leyte, Luzon Abra, Cavite,  Ilocos Norte, Laguna, Pampanga, Rizal, Sorsogon, Marinduque, Maripipi,  Masbate, Mindanao Agusan del Norte, Davao del Sur, Davao Oriental, Lanao  del Norte, Misamis Oriental, Misamis Occidental (Ramayla pers. comm.),  Cotabato (Achondo 2014), North Cotabato (Tanalgo <em>et al.</em> 2015, 2016; Achondo <em>et al.</em>  2014), South Cotabato, Surigao del Norte, and Zamboanga del Sur  provinces), Mindanao (Tanalgo and Tabora 2015), Mindoro, Negros  (Heideman and Utzurrum 2003), Palawan (Esselstyn <em>et al.</em> 2004),  Polillo, Samar (Gonzalez pers. comm. 2006), Sanga-sanga, Sabtang,  Siargao, Sibuyan, Siquijor, Tablas, and Ticao (Paguntalan pers. comm.  2006; Heaney <em>et al.</em> 1998).

However, there are few records, if any, of significant colonies (&gt;1,000 [Thavry <em>et al.</em>  2017]) of the species within protected areas. It is widely accepted  that, if not as a whole, subpopulations of this species are threatened  due to multiple anthropogenic pressures and as a principal bat  pollinator in Old World tropics, its conservation should be prioritized  (Acharya 2015). Its direct ecological role on plant pollination (Acharya  2015) and all related benefits (gene flow of plant species, maintenance  of landscape, local economy, etc) make this species a priority.<br/><br/>Direct  conservation measures across its area of occurrence are necessary to  prevent suspected and projected population declines. Main conservation  priorities include public education, protection of colonies and their  required resources, and the establishment of sustainable harvesting  practices. Sustained public education and increased awareness of the  commercial and ecological importance of pollinators are imperative to  the conservation and protection of this species on a local level  (Maharadatunkamsi 2003, Harbit <em>et al.</em> 2008, Thavry <em>et al.</em>  2017). Law enforcement efforts as well as effective management and  protection are needed to prevent unregulated human disturbances at cave  sites (Bumrungsri <em>et al.</em> 2009,2013; Furey <em>et al.</em> 2011; Tanalgo and Tabora 2015; Thavry <em>et al.</em>  2017).

To safeguard both the bats and the people who rely on them,  sustainable harvesting practices, monitoring programs, and the  protection of limestone karst ecosystems are needed (Molur <em>et al.</em> 2002, Furey <em>et al.</em> 2011).

The Pallid Bat is usually found in rocky, mountainous areas and near water. They are also found over more open, sparsely vegetated grasslands, and they seem to prefer to forage in the open. The Pallid Bat has three different roosts. The day roost is usually in a warm, horizontal opening such as in attics or rock cracks, the night roost is usually in the open, near foliage, and the hibernation roost, which is often in buildings, caves, or cracks in rocks (Miller 2002).The diet of this bat includes a significant proportion of beetles, grasshoppers, and moths, also it consumes scorpions and flightless arthropods such as crickets. Lizards have also been reported as prey items. Mating takes place in late autumn or early winter. Female Pallid Bats store sperm in the reproductive tract until ovulation takes place in the spring. Births generally occur in large maternity colonies in May and Junes. Males are generally absent from these maternity colonies. Yearling females have single offspring, whereas older females may have twins annually (Wilson and Ruff 1999).","The Pallid Bat may be in trouble because it is very sensitive to disturbance. Any disturbance, even hiking, can cause the bat to abandon a roosting area completely. Human disturbance of foraging areas has also decreased prey availability and diversity. Also, the use of pesticides has had a serious impact on Pallid Bat populations (Miller 2002).","It is locally common (Wilson and Ruff 1999).

They are the most abundant of North American bats that are found in deserts, but are found at higher elevations in arid brush lands, grasslands, and even some forests. Western Pipistrelles spend their days roosting in rock crevices, beneath rocks, in burrows, mines, and buildings (Wilson and Ruff 1999). It has been suggested that Western Pipistrelles use burrows made by kangaroo rats (<em>Dipodomys</em> spp.) and other rodents (Barbour and Davis 1969).<br/>This species spends winter hibernating in mines, caves, and rock crevices. Water is a very important resource determining the distribution of this bat. Because of the high proportion of protein in their diet, the arid environment that they inhabit, and the subsequent high levels of evaporate water loss, Western Pipistrelles generally roost close to a water source. Availability of maternity roost sites is an extremely important factor in successful bat reproduction (Cockrum and Cross 1964). However, this species is only modestly colonial, and solitary individuals are typical (Wilson and Ruff 1999).<br/>Western Pipistrelles begin their foraging flights very early in the evening hours, making them one of the most diurnal of North American bats. They may also be encountered later in the evening (4 hrs after sunset), or closer to the morning. Occasionally, individual bats have been observed on wing during mid-day, during which time they seek out water to alleviate stress caused by the arid environment they inhabit. Because these bats fly slowly, they are restricted to small foraging circuits; it is also nonmigratory. They have a very slow, fluttery flight that can often be observed along cliff faces, among pinyon trees, or other desert shrubs. They are often mistaken for large moths (Peters 2003).","Since reopening abandoned or inactive mines can negatively affect bat colonies, it has been recommended that multi-seasonal surveys be conducted prior to allowing any renewed mining. Human disturbance can be extremely detrimental to bat colonies, especially to non-volant young and hibernating adults, depending on the season and severity of the disturbance. Mines that are in close proximity to roads, towns, hiking trails or camp grounds are more susceptible to disturbance then those in remote areas with difficult access. There is a need for greater assurance that roosts will remain undisturbed and that future (potential) roost sites will be left when managing for bats in pinyon-juniper habitat. Ideally, management should aim to sustain adequate food, water, and roost sites in close proximity to one another (Klingel 2000).","These are abundant and most common at low elevations in desert scrub and arid grassland habitats. It is one of the most common bats seen over waterholes and streams in arid habitats. In 1890, C. Hart Merriam wrote that this species was found in swarms in the Grand Canyon of the Colorado River (Arizona), an observation that attests to their abundance and prominence in canyon environments (Wilson and Ruff 1999).",Stable,"This species occurs from Washington to Southwestern Oklahoma (USA), and Baja California, south to Hidalgo and Guerrero (Mexico) (Simmons 2005).",,Terrestrial,Protection of this species requires to avoid habitat loss and human disturbance.

Historic colonies  have been lost throughout its range and ongoing decline occurs in its extent of occurrence (EOO), area of occupancy (AOO), and habitat extent and quality, especially the loss of  cave roosts. Further, introduced species directly and indirectly impact  roosts and foraging areas.<br/><u><br/></u>The <em style="""">E. s. semicaudata </em>subspecies has  suffered dramatic losses throughout its range. The subspecies appears to  have suffered local extinctions in Samoa, American Samoa, Tonga, and  Vanuatu. Fiji appears to be its last bastion and even there, most of the  large historic colonies have been lost and the subspecies is feared to  have been extirpated from many islands where it was previously found.  The current status of the species is not well understood as there have  been no recent assessments.&#160;Similar to <em style="""">E. s. semicaudata</em>, the <em style="""">E. s.  rotensis</em> subspecies has experienced dramatic losses throughout its  distribution on Guam and throughout the Marianna Islands, and it is  currently only known from Aguiguan Island. The status of <em style="""">E. s.  palauensis</em> and <em style="""">E. s. sulcata</em> is uncertain as there have been no recent  assessments. There is little reason to believe these two subspecies are  faring better than their counterparts.","<em><em>Emballonura </em>semicaudata</em> is a small (five gram) cave-obligate bat that roosts in a  range of cave types, including limestone caves, lava tubes,  shelter-caves on overhanging cliffs, and rock crevices (Flannery 1995;  Watling and Pernetta 1978; Grant <em>et al.</em> 1994; Hutson <em>et al.</em> 2001; Palmeirim <em>et al.</em> 2005, 2007; Wiles <em>et al.</em>  2011). Relatively large colonies appear common in the Palau subspecies  while smaller colonies may be more representative of the other  subspecies (Wiles <em>et al.</em> 1997, Wiles and Worthington 2002). Basic  information on roost microclimate and habitat preferences are lacking  for all subspecies (Hutson <em>et al.</em> 2001). It is important to note  that subspecies that have undergone dramatic declines may be persisting  in caves in sub-optimal conditions, after exclusion from their  historical roosts. Pacific sheath-tailed bats are commonly found sharing  caves with swiftlets (<em>Aerodramus </em>spp.) across their range (Watling and Pernetta 1978, Lemke 1986, Hutson <em>et al.</em> 2001, Tarburton 2002, Wiles and Worthington 2002, Palmeirim <em>et al.</em> 2005).<br/><br/>Although  the species has occasionally been recorded flying in daylight under  forest canopy it normally emerges at dusk to forage. While details of  its diet are limited (Hutson <em>et al.</em> 2001), <em>E. s. rotensis</em> have been documented to primarily forage on Hymenopterans and Lepidopterans (Valdez <em>et al.</em> 2011).<br/><br/>The  four subspecies are thought to prefer to forage in well-structured  mature forest (native and non-native) with a high and dense canopy and  relatively near to their roosting caves (Esselstyn <em>et al.</em> 2004, Palmeirim <em>et al.</em> 2005, Gorreson <em>et al.</em> 2009, Valdez <em>et al.</em> 2011, Welch <em>et al.</em> 2016). In Palau and Chuuk, the subspecies has occasionally been  observed foraging over town streets (Bruner and Pratt 1979). Recent work  has documented lower bat activity over introduced lantana shrub  habitats (Welch <em>et al.</em> 2016).","Despite the long-term global population decline of <em>E. semicaudata </em> throughout much of its range, especially the <em>E. s. rotensis</em> and <em>E. s.  semicaudata</em> subspecies, there is no definitive explanation for the of  precipitous declines. Losses have been reported as far back as 1945. All  the subspecies are at high risk of extinction because they occur in  isolated oceanic island systems and are subject to stochastic events,  including the threat from more frequent and stronger major cyclones that  may defoliate forests, reduce the abundance of insect prey or even  cause the direct loss of roosts when storms flood caves or landslides  close cave entrances, exacerbating other threats (Grant <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1994).<br/>Significant  threats include the disturbance of roosting sites from local uses,  vandalism and ecotourism, the loss and degradation of native forests  from timber harvesting and conversion to agricultural lands, mining and  quarrying adjacent to cave roosts and guano mining within roosts,  invasive species (plants and animals (e.g., goats), fire in proximity to  roosts (Grant <em>et al.</em> 1994; Wiles <em>et al</em>. 1997; Palmeirim <em>et al.</em> 2005, 2007; Wiles <em>et al.</em> 2011; Scanlon <em>et al.</em> 2014; Welch <em>et al.</em> 2016).<br/><br/>Further, loss of genetic variation has been recorded for <em>E. s. rotensis </em>(Oyler-McCance <em><em>et al.</em></em>  2013). Recent genetic analysis also supports the separation and  elevation of at least three of the subspecies to full species status.  Specifically, Oyler-McCance <em><em>et al.</em></em> (2013) report that  their “data fully support the separation of these 3 subspecies for  conservation and management purposes”, the fourth subspecies was not  included in their analysis and needs genetic appraisal as well. Although  genetic differentiation exists, the species are yet to be described.  Meanwhile, the subspecies status limits their elevation in conservation  status to Critically Endangered (primarily because the four subspecies  together occur across a vast area), which also impacts the opportunities  for host countries to promote their conservation (Scanlon <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2014). Loss of genetic diversity is a key threat to all subspecies given their increasing isolation and low population levels.<br/><br/>Grant <em><em>et al.</em></em>  (1994) concluded that pesticide contamination was unlikely to be  implicated in the significant decline of <em>E. s. semicaudata</em> in America  Samoa because co-roosting swiftlets did not experience similar losses.  However, it is important to note that bats and swiftlets have different  ecological niches and therefore may be differentially exposed to and/or  susceptible to pesticides. In the Mariana Islands for example, <em>E. s.  rotensis</em> primarily consumed nocturnal Lepidoptera, Coleoptera, and  Hymenoptera, while the swiftlet (Aerodramus bartschi) preferred  Hymenopteran prey (Valdez <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2011). Even within  Hymenoptera, bats primarily fed on Ichneumoideans whereas swiftlets ate  more formicidalates and chalicidoideans (Valdez <em><em>et al.</em></em>  2011). It is unclear if or how pesticides have impacted the Pacific  sheath-tailed bat through bioaccumulation and biomagnification for  example. It is premature to dismiss pesticide contamination as a threat  to <em>E. semicaudata</em> until explicit research has been completed in this  area.","<em>Emballonura semicaudata </em>likely represented a large metapopulation where  each species was previously relatively common over much of their  respective ranges and there was some level of genetic connectedness due  to infrequent movements and successful breeding. Unfortunately, due to  the dramatic declines of the <em>E. s. rotensis </em>and <em>E. s. semicaudata </em> subspecies, the metapopulation structure appears to have broken down as  subpopulations have been and are continuing to be extirpated. While  there still may be subspecies-level metapopulations for <em>E. s. sulcata </em> and <em>E. s. palauensis</em>, that of <em>E. s. rotensis</em> appears to be lost as only  one subpopulation remains and the <em>E. s. semicaudata</em> subpopulation is  greatly reduced due to likely extirpation from several countries.<br/><br/><em><em>Emballonura </em>s. rotensis</em> was last observed on Guam in 1972 and was thought to have  been extirpated from the Northern Mariana Islands after 1932 until the  discovery of a small population on Aguiguan Island (approximately 7 km²  in size) in 1984 (Wiles <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2011). In 2008, there were an estimated 359-466 bats in total using 3 caves; over 70% of the bats used a single cave (Wiles <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2011). As late as 2013, the subspecies was still known from the three caves (Welch <em><em>et al.</em></em>  2016). A recent, but limited survey effort at those three caves  confirmed the continued use of two of the caves, one with an estimated  308-382 bats (Liske-Clark <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2016).<br/><br/>The decline of  <em>E. s. semicaudata</em>, while not as extensive as that documented for<em> E. s.  rotensis</em>, is just as alarming as the subspecies appears to have been  extirpated from Tonga, Samoa, America Samoa, and Vanuatu (Helgen and  Flannery 2002, Uyehara and Wiles 2009, Tarburton 2011, M. Pennay pers.  comm. in Scanlon <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2013). Fiji is the last stronghold  for <em>E. s. semicaudata</em> and its populations are estimated to have  declined by &gt;80% (Scanlon <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2014); the subspecies  is feared to have been extirpated from Viti Levu, Vanua Levu, and the  Yasawa archipelago (Flannery 1995; Palmierim <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2005, 2007; Scanlon <em><em>et al.</em></em>  2014). A new roost found on Taveuni in 2018 with a reported 2,000 bats  appeared to have only a couple of hundred bats in 2019, perhaps due to  the conversion of forest habitat to agriculture lands  (NatureFiji-MareqetiViti, unpublished data). The loss of historic  colonies continues and in 2018, the subspecies was not detected on  Rotuma and experts have proposed it has been extirpated from the island  (Cibois <em><em>et al.</em></em> in press).<br/><br/>The<em> E. s. sulcata</em> and <em>E. s. palauensis</em> subspecies were thought to be relatively stable in the 1990s (Wiles <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1997, Hutson <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2001) and were reported to be doing relatively well within portions of their range as late as 2005 (Wiles <em><em>et al.</em></em>  1997, G. Wiles pers. comm. 2019). Unfortunately, their current status  are unknown as there have been no recent surveys. Given the dramatic  decline of the <em>E. s. rotensis</em> and <em>E. s. semicaudata</em> subspecies  throughout their range, a precautionary view should be taken on their  status until reliable data are obtained.",Decreasing,"<em>Emballonura semicaudata</em> is the only species of Emballonura found in the  Pacific outside of the Solomon Island chain (Koopman 1993, 1997; Helgen  and Flannery 2002). Currently, there are four recognized subspecies,  including: <em><br/></em><ul><li><em>E. s. semicaudata</em> has a historical distribution that includes Samoa, American Samoa, Fiji, Tonga, and Vanuatu. In Samoa, it  was historically found on Savai'i and Upolu islands, where it was  relatively common and in American Samoa, it was found on Manua and  Tutuila islands. This species is now recognized as Critically Endangered  in American Samoa and Samoa (Hutson <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2001, Tarburton 2002), and has not been recorded in American Samoa since 2006 (Fraser <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em>  2009). In Tonga, the subspecies was found on Eua and Niuafoou islands  and was last collected in 1989. It has not been recorded in more recent  surveys (Rinke 1991; M. Pennay, personal communications, 2007 in Scanlon  <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2014). The species was collected from  Espiritu Santo Island, Vanuatu in 1929 and appears to have been  extirpated as more recent surveys have failed to detect the species  (Helgen and Flannery 2002). In Fiji, <em>E. s. semicaudata</em> was historically  found on Fiji’s three largest islands of Viti Levu, Vanua Levu, and  Taveuni. It was also known from the Yasawa archipelago, the Lau Group,  and Rotuma Island (Ingleby and Flannery 1991; Flannery 1995; Palmeirim <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em>  2005, 2007; Scanlon <em>et al.</em> 2014). Unfortunately, the subspecies has  declined dramatically across its range in Fiji and now appears to be  restricted to Taveuni, the Natewa Peninsula of Vanua Levu, and a few  small islands of the Lau Group (Ingleby and Flannery 1991, Flannery  1995, Palmeirim <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2005, 2007, Macedru 2010, Scanlon <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2014); recent surveys suggest it has been extirpated from Rotuma (Cibois <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> in press).

The species is restricted in this region to between 2,400 and 4,800 m in elevation, as below this minimum there is only scattered dry scrub or arid rock desert and above this maximum is the alpine zone (Zahler and Woods 1997, Pal <em>et al.</em> 2019).

Whilst there is ongoing habitat destruction and degradation across several parts of its range, there is no evidence of recent subpopulation declines or extirpations. It may qualify as threatened in the future if further data show that habitat loss or predation by invasive mammals are significant threats.<em><span lang=""EN-US""></em></span></p>","The Hispaniolan Solenodon is found in forests and scrubland, as well as around crops and areas of pasture. It is mainly nocturnal, denning during the day in rock clefts and hollow trees. Its diet is predominately made up of insects found in soil and leaf litter. Solenodons obtain food by rooting in the ground with their snouts and by tearing into rotten logs and trees with their foreclaws. This species is relatively social, and up to eight individuals may inhabit the same den. Litter size is 1 or 2 young. The young are born in a nesting burrow. Young solenodons remain with their mother for several months, which is exceptionally long for insectivores.","The most significant threat to this species appears to be the continuing demise of its forest habitat, through conversion of land for agriculture, cutting of trees for charcoal production, and forest fires. Predation by introduced cats and dogs is also likely to be a considerable threat. During surveys of several rural communities in south-west of the Dominican Republic solenodons and the other island endemic non-volant mammal (<em>Plagiodontia aedium</em>), dogs were reported to have accounted for 73% of known deaths for both species, and attention was drawn to the role played by dogs trained to kill mongoose and feral cats. These dogs are allowed to roam freely in the vicinity of villages during day and night, and are reported to be responsible for 57% of kills, as opposed to only 12% made by dogs taken on specific hunting trips (Turvey <em>et al</em>. 2014). In Haiti persecution and hunting for food (Samuel Turvey pers. comm.) are threats, and there is devastating habitat destruction also occurring. During a trip to&#160;Duchity and Pic Macaya in Haiti, researchers recorded five solenodon deaths caused by dogs (Borroto-Páez and Woods 2012).","Recent research suggests that the species is far more wide-spread across the island of Hispaniola than previously thought. In Haiti the species could be considered Critically Endangered because there is an isolated population with a range less than 100 km², threatened by habitat loss and persecution (S. Turvey and L. Davalos pers. comm.), although more recent searches for the species in the south-east of the country closer to the border with the Dominican Republic have confirmed presence of the species (Kennerley 2014).

22457421,11633,Leporillus apicalis,Extinct,,2016,2012-12-31 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The last two specimens were collected by Norman Tindale, near Mt Crombie, south of the Musgrave Ranges in north-western South Australia in July 1933. Tindale (1933) recorded the burning of the Stick-nest Rats’ nest and the capture of the fleeing inhabitants on his ‘Mann Ranges 1933’ black-and-white film (copies held by the South Australian Museum and by the University of Adelaide). There have been unconfirmed reports since, including one from 1970, and occasional reports of fresh vegetation being added to old stick-nests, but there seems little doubt that the species is Extinct.","<p>Stick-nest Rats constructed large nests of sticks and sometimes stones, depending on available construction materials. Some remaining in caves in breakaways in the Gibson Desert and near the Finke stock route in the southern Northern Territory are more than 3 m by 2 m by 1 m high. Stick nests were also built in wooded country well away from ranges, but most have not survived (Burbidge and Fuller 1979, Copley 1999, see Tindale 1933 for black and white film when the last two specimens were collected). The diet was mainly vegetarian, including leaves of chenopods, other semi-succulent shrubs and grasses, but also included invertebrates such as beetles and termites (Copley 1999). The different food preferences (if not habitat preferences) between the two species of stick-nest rats are reflected in their molar teeth. Although both have incisors that are similar in being relatively narrow and fairly lightly built, their molars are very different. Those of&#160; the Lesser Stick-nest Rat are fairly low-crowned, with quite sloping cusps and with the lophs in the lower molars forming a characteristic chevron pattern, all suggesting that the species fed on relatively high quality food, such as sandalwood nuts (whose shells are usually found in quite large numbers in their stick-nests). In contrast, the molars of the Greater Stick-nest Rat <em>L. conditor</em> are very high-crowned, with almost vertical cusps, suggesting that they fed on larger volumes of lower quality vegetation, such as saltbush, which was fairly abrasive, because old individuals in owl pellet accumulations have quite worn-down teeth (A. Baynes pers. comm.).<br/><br/>The construction of stick-nests shows that shelter was important; the nests probably provided an ameliorated microclimate and some protection from predators. A nest may have sheltered several individuals, with records of up to ten in a nest.<br/><br/>Radiocarbon dates of Stick-nest Rat nest-middens have revealed dates ranging from modern to 10,900 ± 90 BP (Pearson <em>et al</em>. 1999). Pearson and Dodson (1991), Pearson (1999) and Webeck and Pearson (2005) have studied Stick-nest Rat middens to document past changes in vegetation and climate in central Australia, while Pearson <em>et al</em>. (2001) have documented animal remains in the nest-middens.</p>","Predation by feral cats is considered the main cause of extinction. Cats had colonized the whole of Australia by the 1890s (Abbott 2002, 2008). The arrival of Red Foxes in range may have driven remnant subpopulations to extinction; high rabbit numbers led to high fox numbers. Habitat degradation, particularly in refuges during drought, caused by introduced herbivores (mainly rabbits and sheep) before and leading into severe drought conditions may have contributed to extinction. Morton (1990) and Copley (1999) have discussed the effects of introduced herbivores on this and other extinct mammals; Tunbridge (1991) described effects of sheep at the Flinders Ranges. Predation by indigenous predators, such as Dingoes and owls, in combination with habitat degradation by introduced herbivores was probably a minor threat on its own but possibly an enhanced threat when other threats were operating.","<p>Krefft (1866) reported Lesser Stick-nest Rats ‘in great numbers … on both sides of the Murray River’, i.e., New South Wales and Victoria). Many early explorers commented on the abundance and large size of stick-nests, including in northern areas where only this species of <em>Leporillus</em> has been recorded (Copley 1999). However, by the early 20<sup>th</sup> century, explorers and naturalists reported that it was rare. Western desert Aboriginal people reported that it disappeared at least 40 to 50 years prior to the mid-1980s (Burbidge <em>et al</em>. 1988).

The status of this species varies in different parts of its range, but overall this decline is expected to continue in the future.","<p>This species is found in high-altitude cedar and oak forests, coastal scrub, and overgrazed rocky slopes with vestigial vegetation. It is confined to inaccessible rocky areas, gorges, and montane areas (from sea level up to approximately 2,600 m asl) due to habitat use conflicts with humans in more favourable areas. All the areas occupied by the Barbary Macaque are under growing pressure from human activity and habitat availability for <em>M. sylvanus</em> has decreased markedly in recent decades (Camperio Ciani <em>et al</em>. 2005, van Lavieren 2006). <br/><br/>In Algeria, occupied habitats include mixed cedar (<em>Cedrus atlantica</em>) and oak forests; Humid Zen Oak (<em>Quercus canariensis</em>) and Cork Oak (<em>Quercus suber</em>) mixes; Algerian Fir (<em>Abies numidica</em>), cedar and Zen Oak mixed forests; and gorges dominated by scrub vegetation (Taub 1977b, F. Belbachir pers. comm. 2007). Moroccan habitats include high cedar forests (<em>Cedrus atlantica</em>), cedar/Holm Oak (<em>Quercus ilex</em>) mixtures, mixed oak forests (Qu<em>ercus suber, Q. canariensis, Q. ilex </em>and<em> Q. pyrenaica</em>) and cliffs and gorges dominated by scrub vegetation (Waters 2013). In habitats with cedar, macaques can reach densities of 25–40 individuals per km² or greater, whereas in habitats without cedar much lower densities of 5–7 individuals per km² are reported (Fa 1984). Densities in the mixed oak forests of Bouhachem Natural Reserve appear to be much higher than previously reported for the region (Waters unpublished data). In all occupied habitats, there is a species of oak available.<br/><br/>In Algeria, <em>M. sylvanus</em> lives in mixed-sex groups of up to 80 individuals with a modal size of 40 individuals (Ménard 2002). In Morocco, in the Bouhachem Natural Reserve, group size of four study groups was 52–73 with a mean of 62 (Waters <em>et al</em>. 2015). In the Middle Atlas Mountains, group size ranged between 14 and 54 animals with a mean of 25 (Majolo <em>et al</em>. 2013). Life span in the wild is known to be up to 22 years (Lindenfors 2002). Females reach sexual maturity between 3.5 and 4 years of age and males between 4.5 and 7 years of age. In the wild, average age at first birth is 5.3 years for females (Ménard and Vallet 1993, 1996; Lindenfors 2002) and the interbirth interval is 1.3 years (Taub 1974 in Fa 1984, Ménard and Vallet 1993, 1996).</p>","<p>The destruction and degradation of the Barbary Macaque’s forest habitat is the most serious threat to the species. The severity of different threats varies in different parts of the species' range. <br/><br/>Severe habitat loss, fragmentation and degradation have been caused by domestic and industrial consumption of wood, use of fire, clearing for cultivation and overgrazing by sheep and goat herds (Taub 1977a, Fa 1984, Camperio Ciani 1986, Ménard and Vallet 1993). This is exacerbated by poor forestry management; often <em>Cedrus atlanticus</em> is favoured and efforts are made to reduce <em>Quercus ilex</em>, but the latter species is a crucial resource for Barbary Macaques in some areas of their distribution (Ménard and Vallet 1986, 1996). In Morocco, severe habitat loss is also caused by extensive logging of cedar trees, occurring within and outside national parks (B. Majolo pers. obs. 2014).<br/><br/>As well as habitat degradation resulting from overgrazing by livestock is a major threat to the species (and a problem which is exacerbated by drought), in recent years, shepherds have increasingly settled near water sources. As shepherd tribes move into the forest, they often enclose open water sources with cement wells to be able to extract water for their herds. As a result, Barbary Macaques and other wildlife have been excluded from water sources in areas where it was previously accessible to them (Camperio Ciani <em>et al</em>. 2003).<br/><br/>Conflicts with local people have been reported in Algeria, as a result of crop-raiding by macaques (e.g., villages in Djurdjura National Park in the Grande-Kabylie region: F. Belbachir pers. comm. 2007). Crop raiding by Barbary Macaques has been reported by farmers in the area of Ouzoud (El Alami and Chait 2014) and other areas of the High Atlas. As a consequence, the shooting of Barbary Macaques as a result of crop raiding and cedar bark stripping was reported by Deag (1977) and must be seen as an ongoing threat to the species’ future.<br/><br/>In Algeria, national park officials indicate that the primary problem faced by Barbary Macaques is the conflict with mountain settlers, agricultural farmers and crop producers. Recently, regulation of forest use and access in Algeria has changed and it is now easier for people to use the forest areas. During the 1980s and 1990s, Algerians faced public curfews and restricted access to mountainous/forested regions due to civil war. Until recently, settlers were allowed to return to homes once occupied by their relatives in areas where Barbary Macaques are present. For example, in Chréa National Park, the human population increased from 550–600 individuals in 1993 to over 6,000 in 2015. Growth in human populations has resulted in a rise in infrastructure development in and around these areas, increasing the chances of macaque and human interaction through crop raiding, feeding interactions, as well as vehicle accidents (Benrabah 2015). Development of infrastructure has been shown to negatively impact wild macaques. For example, between 2008 and 2015, 31 incidents were recorded by park officials in Chréa National Park, including vehicle-related deaths of macaques (12 incidents) and 11 attempts of illegal capture of wild monkeys (Benrabah 2015). <br/><br/>The illegal live primate trade is also a significant threat to Barbary Macaques, as is their exploitation as photo props in tourist areas. Reports of capture for the international pet trade date back to 1977 (Deag 1977), and since then the trade has increased markedly (van Lavieren 2004). The Barbary Macaque was the most commonly confiscated mammal recorded by breeding programmes in European zoos between 2006–2010 (Zimmerman 2011). Infant <em>M. sylvanus</em> are offered both openly and covertly for sale on markets across Morocco, and prices of up to 200 Euros per animal have been recorded (van Lavieren 2004). Prices of about 100 Euros per animal have been recorded in Algeria, with Chaabet-el-Akhra gorges (Béjaïa) and Yakouren (Akfadou) cited as critical locations where illegal trade occur (F. Belbachir pers. comm. 2007).<br/><br/>Additional threats include persecution, predation by dogs (Waters 2014), unmanaged primate tourism (Marechal <em>et al</em>. 2011, Borg <em>et al</em>. 2014), and pollution of the wadis (rivers) associated with forests (E. van Lavieren pers. comm. 2006, F. Belbachir pers. comm. 2007). Barbary Macaques seem to be rarely used for food, except as noted in some old reports in Algeria (Deag 1977).</p>","<p>In 1975, the Moroccan population of Barbary Macaques was estimated to be about 17,000 (Taub 1975). In Algeria, the population was estimated at 5,500 animals around 40 years ago (Taub 1977a). Alhough Von Segesser <em>et al</em>. (1999) estimated the species at around 15,000 individuals in 1999, this estimate was based on incomplete data.<br/><br/>Two population surveys conducted in 2013 and 2015 at 23 locations in Algeria estimated the Algerian population to be 1,336–3,506 animals (Benrabah 2015, Benrabah <em>et al</em>. unpublished data), representing an average population decrease of 50% in comparison to the last published survey (Fa 1984). Algerian subpopulations are highly fragmented (Fa 1984, Von Segesser <em>et al</em>. 1999). In 1999, just seven widely separated isolated populations existed, whereas 35 years ago they were found in at least six additional locations in Algeria (Von Segesser <em>et al</em>. 1999). Currently, in Algeria there is a remaining isolated population in Gorge Chiffa and the Park National of Chrea (131–352 individuals) (Benrabah <em>et al</em>. unpublished data). The populations of Djurdjura, Tikjda, Akhfasou, Bejaia, Gouraya, Yakouoren, Kherrata, Draguina, Taza, Ait Alouane, Guerrouch and el Babor are fragmented.<br/><br/>In Morocco, a number of surveys have documented marked declines in population density, along with losses of a number of sites (Von Segesser <em>et al</em>. 1999, Camperio Ciani <em>et al</em>. 2005, van Lavieren 2006). Fourteen isolated populations were identified in the High Atlas (Cuzin 2003). A recent survey in the Central High Atlas Mountains reported direct observations of 644 individuals in 23 groups with a mean group size of 21 individuals. However, irregular surveys over a long period may have resulted in an overestimate of the population (El Alami <em>et al</em>. 2013).<br/><br/>The cedar forest area of the central Middle Atlas represents the largest refuge of the North African forest ecosystem. In the 1980s, it was estimated that 65–75% of the world's remaining population of <em>Macaca sylvanus</em> lived in this area (Camperio Ciani 1986). In the mid-1970s, population densities in the central Middle Atlas cedar forest were variously estimated at 60–70 individuals per km² (Deag 1974) or 43 per km² (Taub 1975). The most recent population estimate for the Middle Atlas is 5,000 macaques with densities of up to 23.4 individuals per km² (Menard <em>et al</em> 2013a). These data indicate that, in the central Middle Atlas, average population density is three times less than it was 30 years ago (<em>ca</em> 15,000; Taub 1977). In addition, Menard <em>et al</em>. (2013b) estimated that 46% of immatures were removed from macaque groups habituated for tourism in Ifrane National Park by poachers for the pet trade.<br/><br/>In the Rif Mountains, recent and current surveys are revealing that the populations are not as fragmented and low as previously thought. A recent survey has estimated a population of ~1,500 macaques in contiguous mixed oak forest in the Bouhachem Natural Reserve where there is very little poaching pressure for the pet trade (Waters <em>et al</em>. unpublished data).<br/><br/>On Gibraltar, the population is maintained at <em>ca</em> 300 animals but now occurs in more and smaller groups. Some of these groups often range in built-up areas and have caused serious conflict with residents. One such group has been captured and sent to a captive collection in the UK (Waters 2015).</p>",Decreasing,"<p>The Barbary Macaque is the only surviving primate in Africa north of the Sahara Desert, the only native species of primate to occur in Europe, and the only member of the genus <em>Macaca</em> that can be found outside Asia. In prehistoric times, this species inhabited Southern Europe and all of North Africa (Delson 1980, Camperio Ciani 1986). In historic times, it was widespread throughout North Africa from Libya to Morocco, but its current distribution is limited to small relict patches of forest and scrub in Algeria and Morocco (Fa 1984, Camperio Ciani 1986, Scheffrahn <em>et al</em>. 1993, Menard and Vallet 1996). A semi-wild population lives in Gibraltar, which is a long established introduced population (Fa 1981, von Starck 1990, Hodges and Cortes 2006).<br/><br/>In Morocco, <em>M. sylvanus</em> is found in the Rif mountains (northern Morocco) and the Middle and High Atlas Mountains (central Morocco). More specifically, in Morocco the High Atlas populations (two anciently separated populations) are found from Demnat to El Ksba (El Alami <em>et al</em>. 2013) and around the Ourika Valley. In the Rif, Barbary Macaques are found in the protected areas of Bouhacham Natural Reserve, Talessemtane National Park, and Djebel Moussa (Waters <em>et al</em>. unpublished data).<br/><br/>In Algeria, the species is found in the Tellian Atlas (Petite Kabylie and Grande Kabylie Mountains, and an isolated population in the Chréa National Park) in the north. From west to east, Barbary Macaque populations in Algeria are distributed as follows: Park National of Chrea (Gorge Chiffa), Park National of Djurdjura (Djurdjura and Tikjda), Park National of Bejaia, and Gouraya, Forests of Akhfadou, Yakouren, Gorges of Kherrata Forests of Draguina, Forests of Toudja, Park National of Taza (Ait Aloaune, Guerrouch and El Babor) (Benrabah, 2015). Additionally, a Barbary Macaque population might still occur in Djebel Bouzegza (Boumerdes, Grande-Kabylie) (F. Belbachir pers. comm. 2007).<br/><br/>The species occurs from sea level to 2,600 m asl (Cuzin 2003).</p>",,Terrestrial,"<p><em>Macaca sylvanus</em> receives protection under national and international legislation, but law enforcement is inadequate. The species is listed on Appendix I of CITES. In 2000, the European Community suspended imports of <em>M. sylvanus</em> from Algeria and Morocco under the provisions of Article 4.6b of EC Regulation 338/97 because such trade was deemed to have a harmful impact on the species' status.<br/><br/>In both Morocco and Algeria, the national forestry departments are responsible for the management and the protection of flora and fauna. The Moroccan HCEFCLD collaborates with a Barbary Macaque conservation NGO to confiscate illegally-held macaques. The Moroccan NGO, Barbary Macaque Conservation in the Rif (BMCRif), has had success using social media to raise awareness among the Moroccan public who now regularly report illegally-held macaques in the Rif region, which are then confiscated by the forestry authorities (Waters and El Harrad 2013). The wildlife protection law in Morocco has recently been strengthened and confiscations take place more often. Some individuals are then released into the wild if they meet basic criteria. This strategy is successful for animals under one year of age due to the Barbary Macaque’s allo-parenting behaviour (Waters <em>et al</em>. 2016).<br/><br/>With the rise in human presence and economic development in these regions, there may be an increase of fragmentation and separation, further isolating Barbary Macaques populations and preventing migration/dispersal (Benrabah 2015). However, with careful planning, the highly fragmented populations in Algeria could be reconnected via ecological corridors composed of forest patches, gorges, river basins and scrub regions. Ecological corridors are available for migration/dispersal of animals, provided the necessary actions are undertaken to protect those areas to assure they are suitable for the stable presence of macaques.<br/><br/>There has been some success recorded in Morocco with carefully-planned community projects; although crop raiding by Barbary Macaques does occur, community conservation activities are proving adequate to decrease human-macaque conflict in Bouhachem and persecution of the macaques by shepherds has ceased (Waters 2014).<br/><br/>A number of activities have been undertaken to increase public awareness and reduce illegal trade in this species. The Moroccan NGO BMRif collaborates with both regional and national forestry authorities to raise awareness about the Barbary Macaque including its status as a protected species. AAP (a Netherlands-based sanctuary for exotic animals) has initiated a project to combat illegal trade of Barbary Macaques into Europe, involving inter alia awareness raising among potential buyers, cooperation with authorities in consumer countries and training of customs officers in Spain (E. van Lavieren pers. comm. 2006). The NGO Moroccan Primate Conservation Foundation has trained local ecoguards whose task is to prevent attempts to capture macaques in Ifrane National Park for the illegal primate trade.<br/><br/>Most Barbary Macaque habitats in Algeria have national park status. Protected areas in Morocco harbouring populations of this species include the Toubkal National Park, Eastern High Atlas N.P., Ifran N.P., Talassemtane N.P., Bou Hachem Natural Reserve and Djebel Moussa SIBE in Morocco, and the Djurdjura, Taza, Chréa, and Gouraya National Parks in Algeria. However, the parks in Algeria and Morocco suffer from significant human impact, and these areas require much stricter protection than is currently in place.<br/><br/>In Algeria, there is increasing awareness of the importance of protecting Barbary Macaques. For example, managers of the national parks of Chrea, Djurdjura and Gouraya/Bejaia have recently started filling in systematic incident reports any time monkeys are observed being killed, injured or have disappeared as a consequence of human activity (Benrabah 2015). Such records give useful estimates of the type/intensity of threats faced by the monkeys. Although a trend of population decline in Algeria and Morocco has been documented over the last 30 years, the rate of decline has been lower in Algeria than in Morocco. Threats facing Barbary Macaques in Algeria slightly differ from those of the Moroccan population. Tourism impacts are less noticeable in Algeria due to the lack of development of a tourist industry. In addition, surveillance by military and policing authorities is comparably higher in Algeria, contributing to a lower risk of poaching and illegal trade. Habitat degradation and human conflict over agricultural habitats are the primary causes of macaque population decline. Access to mountain and forested regions has increased since the civil strife of the 1990s in Algeria, thus increasing competition between humans and macaques in relation to the use of habitats for agriculture, domestic herd grazing and garbage disposal. <br/><br/>The Moroccan High Commission of Water and Forests along with a Dutch NGO, Moroccan Primate Conservation (MPC), published an action plan for the Barbary Macaque in 2012, focusing on the population in Ifane National Park. In 2016, the Algerian authorities are organising an action planning workshop assisted by IUCN. The Moroccan NGO BMCRif will collaborate with stakeholders to organise action planning workshops in 2017 and 2018 for the Rif populations.</p>",Palearctic,,false,false,Global & Mediterranean

The greatest number of mature individuals counted at a single site was ± 40. All recorded colonies are suspected to comprise the same subpopulation.

Thus its occurrence is in most cases subject to suitable sheltered and/or subterranean habitats. Regions with rock habitats that form cavities are of utmost importance for the survival of this species. Artificially created habitat such as abandoned mine or prospecting shafts/tunnels within various vegetation types also serve as important/essential habitat sanctuaries. <em>Rhinolophus cohenae</em> requires suitable natural habitat outside roost sites for foraging.

A major threat within this species’ range is mining (legal, illegal and recommissioning of old mines). Future developments at the above rates or even higher are likely to cause further detriment towards natural ecosystems and processes and in particular, disturb or destroy foraging grounds and roosting and maternity sites, or alter key micro-climates needed by the species. Additionally, loss of natural habitat around roost sites through poor land-use management practices, (such as inappropriate burning regimes, overgrazing and alteration of vegetation structure negatively affect foraging areas and prey base), land development activities including agricultural intensification (Driver <em>et al</em>. 2012), and alien invasive plant infestations are causing a decline in available habitat for foraging.<br/><br/>Climate change may also influence micro-climate distribution. This species is very dependent on suitable subterranean environments for roosting and maternity requirements and associated natural habitats for foraging.

Recent collecting has shown that, although essentially limited to one province of South Africa (with an isolated small Zimbabwean population), the species is quite widespread so areas of occupancy and extent of occurrence exceed the thresholds for Vulnerable under criterion B. There is no evidence for declines in the species or its habitat. However, colony sizes are very small and the species appears to have a scattered occurrence in the landscape (e.g., it is rarely collected with harp traps or recorded with bat detectors during surveys of the Soutpansberg). Since it is limited by availability of roosting sites, and possibly suitable water sources, it is hard to believe that the entire population of the species could be much more than 1,000 individuals, so it could potentially be Vulnerable under criterion D1. Until the popualtion size can be confirmed to be below 1,000, however, the species is assessed as Near Threatened (nearly meets VU D1).","The species appears to be locally quite widespread in the Soutpansberg, Blouberg and Waterberg ranges in Limpopo Province as well as in the Limpopo Valley (19 localities known), where it is dependent on natural caves or man-made underground cavities such as old mine adits. One roost in the Soutpansberg comprised an underground spring which had been opened to the surface artificially. Colony sizes are small (just a few individuals). The single individual of this species from Zimbabwe was recorded from a natural gorge (Lutope Gorge) where one individual was collected among a much larger series of <em>R. mossambicus</em>, indicating that these two species can occur sympatrically.","There are no known major threats to this species at present as much of its range occurs throughout the Soutpansberg, Blouberg and Waterberg ranges of Limpopo where human impacts and habitat transformation are not yet severe. The threat of extensive planned coal, platinum, natural gas (fracking) and other mining developments over much of the Limpopo Valley and the foothills of the Soutpansberg and Waterberg mountains and the Mahabeng Plateau, could impact heavily on populations, e.g. through roosting and foraging habitat loss, noise, air and water pollution and water abstraction leading to degradation of riparian habitats.

Soil erosion caused by human pedestrian traffic on hiking paths may be a threat around some of the streams (Skelton Gorge and Nursery Ravine). Water abstraction from Windows Gorge by Kirstenbosch Gardens has resulted in 150 m of habitat loss below the abstraction point and limits the vertical movement of tadpoles in summer when abstraction occurs (K.

However, during the summer, the stream below abstraction point dries up and is likely to cause declines within the subpopulations at Windows Gorge as tadpoles cannot survive.

Tadpoles were historically found in Cecelia Gorge, but they have not been recorded since 1980 (Minter <em>et al.</em> 2004) due to heavy land transformation and afforestation around that stream.

The study by Bray <em>et al</em>. (unpublished) found that the species exhibited a preference for areas sheltered from strong winds, and that they utilized forest, palm and open rocky habitats where suitable shelter and oviposition sites (root systems or crevices in trees or rocks) existed. The species was found to nest communally, with each female laying a single egg, and individual oviposition sites showed evidence that they were reused over multiple years (Bray <em>et al.,&#160;</em>unpublished).

The Black Rat preys on the eggs of this gecko, resulting in recruitment failure. This introduction has resulted in this gecko being confined to small pockets of suitable microhabitat in which rat-proof oviposition sites were abundant (Colgan <em>et al.</em>&#160;2005). The offshore islands are sufficiently close to Lord Howe that the rat may be able to colonize them naturally; while rats have not become established on the islands in the last century, they remain a potential threat and four of the islands are now regularly visited by tourists or researchers, which may increase the likelihood of accidental introduction (D. Chapple pers. comm. 2017).&#160;<br/><br/>Cogger (2004) identified several threats to both lizard species found on Norfolk Island: past habitat loss and degradation, soil compaction and erosion caused by grazing and burrowing rabbits (Phillip Island) and invasive plants, the increased risk of spreading exotic/invasive species of plants and animals to offshore islands through increased tourist visitation to those islands, the increased threat of direct habitat damage to offshore islands through impacts of human traffic, including fire risk from camp fires, and direct habitat loss through land clearance. Within the last decade the invasive House Gecko <em>Hemidactylus frenatus</em>, which has resulted in declines and extinctions of island geckos elsewhere in the world through competitive exclusion or predation (Csurhes and Markula 2009, Cole <em>et al. </em>2005), has been heard calling on Lord Howe (D. Chapple pers. comm. 2017). It is unclear whether this species is presently established on Lord Howe, but it is widespread on the Australian mainland and extensive shipping between the mainland and Lord Howe probably makes its establishment on the island inevitable (D. Chapple pers. comm. 2017).","On Norfolk Island this species has apparently been extinct since before human settlement and is known only from sub-fossil remains. It is still abundant on the offshore islands and rocks that remain rat-free (Smith <em>et al.</em>&#160;2012). A survey by Cogger <em>et al.</em>&#160;(2000) suggests that this species has a population of between 99,000 and 176,000 on Phillip Island, making it at least as abundant as, and probably much more abundant than, a 1978 survey by Cogger (1979 cited in Director of National Parks 2010), at which time this species was conservatively estimated to have a population of 100,000.<br/><br/>This species was apparently abundant on the main island of Lord Howe as late as the 1930s but is now uncommon, following a severe decline in its numbers and range presumably as a result of increased rat numbers (Bray <em>et al.</em> unpublished) and habitat changes. A &#160;single ""dense population"" was found to survive in the north of the island between North Beach and New Gulch in surveys between 2010 and 2013 (Bray <em>et al.</em>&#160;unpublished), but no evidence was found that the species survives elsewhere in this part of Lord Howe. While the species was found to be widespread in the centre of the island in this study, it generally occurred at low densities, with the densest recorded subpopulation estimated to consist of around 300 individuals in an area of 3,000 m<sup>2</sup>&#160;using mark-recapture techniques (Bray<em> et al</em>. unpublished). Only a single juvenile was found in multiple surveys of the south (Bray<em> et al.</em> unpublished). No time series is available for determining recent population trends on the main island, as prior to the 2010-2013 survey the most recent systematic survey was in 1966, and failed to locate any geckos (Cogger 1971). Bray <em>et al</em>. (unpublished) found evidence in the form of broken eggshells that the species persisted recently in areas of the southern mountains where neither extant subpopulations nor evidence of recent breeding were detected, which may indicate that declines and potentially local extinctions are ongoing.<br/><br/>It is still abundant on the small, rocky, offshore islands on which there are large colonies of seabirds (Cogger 2014). On Blackburn Island, surveys recorded nine geckos in 30 minutes, and slightly lower (20 geckos in one and a half hours) numbers on Mutton Bird Island (Bray <em>et al.,</em> unpublished).",Decreasing,"This species occurs only on two oceanic island complexes in the western Pacific, off the eastern coast of Australia: Lord Howe Island and Norfolk Island (Colgan&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2005). It&#160;occurs on Lord Howe Island and its small satellite islands (Mutton Bird, Ball's Pyramid, Blackburn and Roach Island - Bray <em>et al</em>., unpublished data). It was formerly widespread on Lord Howe Island, but while recent records exist from sites across the island the species appears to remain widespread only in the central region, with a patchy distribution in the north and almost none from the southern mountains (Bray <em>et al.</em>, unpublished). While this species has not occurred on the main island of Norfolk Island since prior to European colonization (Colgan&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2005) it remains extant on two of the satellite islands, Nepean and Phillip Islands, and on three small rocky islets - Moo'oo Stone, Bird Rock and Green Pool Stone, each about 100 m from the northern cliffs of Norfolk Island (Director of National Parks 2010).",There is no significant use of or trade in this species.,Terrestrial,"Lord Howe Island is a World Heritage Area.

While the presence of the fungus has not been confirmed in the Americas, it is spreading in Europe and risks spreading further. The threat of infection and population declines in salamanders is thought to be highly likely and detrimental to the majority of native species, should the fungus arrive in Mexico (Basanta&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2019, Mexico Red List Assessment Workshop October 2019). However, a study by Basanta&#160;<em>et al</em>.

Limited records for this species  are from montane forest habitats generally above 1,000 m asl to 1,680 m asl,  suggesting it is restricted relatively high elevations on montane to  mossy forest. However, the Mt. Pangal capture in Northern Sierra Madre  is the lowest elevation record for this species at 550 m asl and is  characterized as a lower montane forest. Records from New Bataan and Mt.  Mahuson and Mt. Apo National Park were from degraded habitats, which  may indicate that this species can tolerate some level of disturbance. In Mt. Apo National Park, for example, this species was captured in a net placed in a cultivated area. More research  needs to be done on distribution extent and ecological requirements of  this species to determine specific conservation needs of this endemic fruit bat.  If it is similar to <em>Dyacopterus spadiceus</em>, this species may require cave  habitats.","The primary threats to the species is from past and ongoing forest habitat degradation and loss through the intrusion of agriculture,  recreation/ecotourism, and rural communities into its known range. If the species is  documented to use caves, like the similar <em>Dyacopterus spadiceus</em>, then we  expect cave disturbance to be a significant threat as it is prevalent throughout the Philippines. While there are  currently no records of hunting of this species, given its size, it is  likely taken when other species are hunted in an area. More data are  needed to ascertain the degree of threat from hunting.","Very little information is available about the population status for this species due to the limited data available. It is rarely captured, mostly at high elevations, and may be mistaken for similar species.

In Taiwan, the species has undergone continuous declines of &gt;90% in several of the largest known colonies and estimated losses of &gt;70% of known individuals in the last 30 years and similar patterns are suspected throughout its range.","Habitat use, roost ecology and natural history for the species at global  scale are poorly known. In Taiwan, the species has been known to roost  in foliage of 35 plant species, mainly broad-leaved trees (e.g.  <em>Terminalia catapapa</em>, <em>Dimocarpus longan</em>, <em>Hibiscus tiliaceus</em> and <em>Swietenia  mahagoni</em>) and in buildings during breeding seasons (Chang 2007).  Records are from small secondary forest fragments and settlements in  rice paddy-dominated landscape in the lowland during breeding season. It  has been recorded using nature caves and abandoned tunnels in mountain  area with elevations over 1800 m as hibernacula in India (Chakravarty <em>et al.</em>  pers. comm.) and in Taiwan (Heng-Chia Chang, pers. obs). In Pakistan,  few individuals were captured in a mountainous landscape dominated by  agriculture lands, forest patches and grassland in warm temperate zone  (Mahmood-ul-Hassan and Salim 2015). In Taiwan, a well-studied maternity  colony began to form in late March, and number peaked in May when  pregnant females gave birth with one offspring during May to June. The  bats left the maternity roost sites between mid-August and early October  for hibernation sites (Shen and Lee 2000). The species is reported  mainly feeding on small flying insects, including coleopterans,  lepidopterans, dipterans, hemipterans (Yang 1996) and foraging in rice  paddy (Ying-Yi Ho, unpubl. data) and riparian grassland (Joe Chun-Chia  Huang, pers. obs.) in the lowland.","Not much is known about the global threats of the species due to its  general rarity. In Taiwan, the causes responsible for the wide and  dramatic decline of this species are also unclear. However, several  potential threats have been proposed. The continuous loss of arable land  and uses of pesticide may have threatened the species by loss of food  source. Several types of pesticide residue were detected from the faeces  of this species (Heng-Chia Chang and Chia-Jung Tsai 2013). Since the  species is at least partly cave-dwelling during winter hibernation,  hence the disturbance of hibernacula and climate changes can be threats.  Two roadkill incidences of the species reported from Taiwan (<a rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"" href=""https://roadkill.tw/"">https://roadkill.tw/</a>)  indicate it is potentially risked by the expansion of road systems and  increasing vehicle volume within its distribution range. A dead bat  found near wind farm in coastal area in western Taiwan suggests the  development of wind energy farms may threaten this species. Domestic  cats might be another threat as a cat-killed incidence is found in  Taiwan (Heng-Chia Chang, pers. obs). Observations in the field show the  presence of artificial light could suppress its emerging from the roost  (Yang 1996). It also tends to avoid artificial light during foraging in  the night (Joe Chun-Chia Huang and Ying-Yi Ho, pers. obs.) suggesting  light pollution may cause degradation of habitats quality, disturbances  to the roost and interference to the migration movement. As it roosts  among foliage, logging also threaten its populations. This species has  conspicuous colouration, hence it may be used as ornament.","It is a generally rare although widely distributed species from northern South Asia to southeastern China and Taiwan (Csorba <em>et al.</em>  2014). It usually roosts as a few to tens animals, although under  specific circumstances it can be relatively numerous, with up to over a  thousand individuals in a single house roost (Heng-Chia Chang, pers.  com.). In Taiwan, continuous and dramatic declines have been observed at  all its largest known colonies. The three colonies containing &gt;100  individuals all experienced a colony size decrease, from ~120-250 to 20  or less. (Heng-Chia Chang and Ying-Yi Ho, unpub. data). Similar trends  of decline were also widely found in ~70% of other smaller colonies  (Heng-Chia Chang unpub. data).",Decreasing,"The species has a rather wide distribution from Afghanistan to Taiwan. Bates and Harrison (1997) and Mandal <em>et al.</em>  (2000) report the species from Afghanistan, India (Jammu and Kashmir,  Himachal Pradesh, Punjab, Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, West  Bengal, Sikkim, Assam, Meghalaya and Karnataka). It occurs also in Nepal  (Mahalaxmi and Dhaulagiri), Pakistan, China (Tibet and Jianxi) and  Taiwan. The species has one record from northern Vietnam (Csorba <em>et al.</em>  2014, Mahmood-ul-Hassan and Salim 2015).

There is no direct conservation assessment in the other countries  within its distribution. In Taiwan, all known hibernacula are found in  protected forest areas. The protection of roosts and foraging habitats  is important for this species. Since the population in Taiwan is  migratory, the connectivity between its breeding habitats and winter  hibernacula sites therefore is critical for this species as well.  Studies on migratory movement and influences of pesticides to its  survival are necessary. Further monitoring to understand the intensity  of the incidences by wind turbines, vehicle collision and cat kill is  also recommended.",Indomalayan,,false,false,Global

The breeding season varies between islands, but extends from January to September, with a peak between April-June.

Although this figure is considerably higher than the previous estimate, the increase in numbers may reflect increased sampling effort rather than an actual population increase, however the species is now believed to be more widely distributed than previously thought (Martín and Lorenzo 2001, Martín <em>et al</em>. 2000).

However, these threats have ceased and the population may now begin to increase. Given the species's longevity it is retained as Near Threatened on the basis of the past declines. <p></p> <p></p>","Breeding takes place in burrows in sandy soil and rocky crevices. Birds attend colonies for at least 10 months of the year, arriving nocturnally to reduce predation by Western Gulls <em>Larus occidentalis </em>(Keitt <em>et al</em>. 2004) and ravens. Eggs are laid in March and hatching begins in early May (Keitt 1998)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. <p></p>","On Natividad, in the past, predation by c.20 feral cats reduced the population causing &gt;1,000 recorded deaths per month prior to their eradication which reduced mortality to less than 100 per month (Keitt <em>et al. undated,</em><em>&#160;</em>2002). Road construction and the establishment of a small fishing community have decreased breeding habitat and burrows (Keitt 1998), and trampled burrows and lights continue to cause some mortality (Keitt and Albores-Barajas <em>unpublished data</em>). Introduced rodents in Isla Rasa, in the Gulf of California, have been successfully eradicated, but no population monitoring has been carried out since first nesting record occurred in 2010 (Velarde&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2015).&#160;Predation by Western gulls and common raven can be easily observed both on chicks and adults, while eggs and young chicks are occasionally predated by white-tail antelope squirrel, <em>Ammospermophilus leucurus</em> (Albores-Barajas and Garcia <em>unpublished data</em>). The Guadalupe population is thought to be predated by cats (B. Tershy and B. Keitt <em>in litt.</em> 1999). It is possible that cat predation has caused the extirpation, or at the very least, significantly reduced populations of this species from the main island of Guadalupe (Keitt <em>et al.</em> 2006). In 2003, remains were found on cliffs at the southwest edge of Guadalupe in excellent potential nesting habitat. It is not known if these observations indicate breeding or prospecting birds. The presence of habitat inaccessible to cats provides hope that this species may still breed in small remnant populations on the main island of Guadalupe (Keitt <em>et al.</em> 2006). Calls from prospecting adults in the cliffs of Melpomene Arroyo, indicate birds are readily available to recolonize the main island in the absence of cat predation (Keitt <em>et al.</em> 2006). On all islands, introduced herbivores (donkeys, goats, sheep and rabbits) have caused erosion (reducing soil for burrows), trampled burrows, and destroyed vegetation, and rabbits may have displaced birds from burrows (Keitt 1998, B. Tershy and B. Keitt in litt. 1999). Gill-net fisheries may cause some mortality (Carboneras 1992d). The human population at Natividad Island has continued to increase, with more houses built over the last few years. Although the houses are concentrated on the town area, there is more human presence on the island. Also, from time to time there are mountain biking races organized on the island and the track runs through the colony. Although the bikes tend to stay within the race track, it might be that this causes some human disturbance to the burrowing seabirds.&#160;<p></p>","The total population estimated in 1998-1999 was around 80,000 pairs, and therefore 160,000 mature individuals. In 2016, aerial photography and GIS were used to count during the breeding season the total number of occupied and unoccupied burrows in Natividad Island. The counts gave a figure of 37,858 (±8510 SE) breeding pairs, and therefore about 75,600 individuals. This figure was based on the initial occupancy of burrows on February 2016. Of the initial number of occupied burrows, there were 4,543 (about 12% of the burrows occupied) which were initially occupied but later abandoned by the birds (Albores-Barajas <em>et al. in press</em>).<br/><br/>Counts produced much lower numbers than previous estimates. It is likely that the methods used in 1998-99 overestimated the population size. The author extrapolated counts of nests in selected areas to the whole surface of the island used by birds without considering that there were large areas without any burrow. During the last survey, thanks to aerial photography, it was possible to precisely count all the burrows which were actually present (Albores-Barajas <em>et al. in press</em>). The total number of burrows counted, including occupied and abandoned burrows, was 56,395 with a relatively low occupancy (between 75% and 50% depending on the area).<br/><br/>Between 2014 and early 2016 the birds on Natividad were also affected by the presence of a wire fence next to the local rubbish dump and on the trajectory used by bird when moving from colony to sea. Several carcasses were found during the survey in February 2016. When the situation was analysed using thermal cameras, it was observed that at least 20 individuals collided with the fence every day, resulting in seven dead individuals/day. This mortality rate was estimated equivalent to the predation of five cats (Albores-Barajas<em> et al. in press</em>).

Where surveys in the late 1990s estimated 114,000 burrows (Keitt et al. 2003), only 56,000 burrows were recorded in 2016, however it is considered that the methods used in 1998-1999 overestimated the population size (Albores-Barajas <em>et al. in press</em>).

Despite the fact that the population trend appears to be decreasing, the decline is not believed to be sufficiently rapid to approach the thresholds for Vulnerable under the population trend criterion (&gt;30% decline over ten years or three generations). The population size is very large, and hence does not approach the thresholds for Vulnerable under the population size criterion (&lt;10,000 mature individuals with a continuing decline estimated to be &gt;10% in ten years or three generations, or with a specified population structure). For these reasons the species is evaluated as Least Concern.","This species inhabits mainly rocky country with cliffs and ravines, caves, patches of woodland, scattered trees or groves, generally in undisturbed wilderness areas. It also uses open forest, taiga and other types of woodland, wooded steppe, river valleys with gorges, overgrown quarries and farmland with suitable rocky areas or cliffs. The species is monogamous and breeds from February to August in Scandinavia, however egg-laying occurs in December in France. It nests on sheltered cliff ledges or in crevices, in a cave entrance, on the ground on steep slope or on flatter ground in taiga. Occasionally it uses old tree nests of other species and rarely in hole in tree. The same site is often used for several years or in rotation with other favoured sites. Clutches are usually two to four eggs (Holt&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2013). It feeds mostly on mammals from small rodents to hares and birds to the size of herons and buzzards, but it also consumes reptiles, frogs, fish and larger insects. It also preys on other owl species in its range (König 2008). The species is resident in most of its range and juveniles disperse over variable distances (Holt&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2013).","Most declines are due to human activity. It is extremely sensitive and the slightest disturbance can cause the abandonment of the nest. Unfortunately cross-country skiing, mountaineering, alpinism and other leisure activities often take people unknowingly near nests (Tucker and Heath 1994). It suffers from human persecution and poisoning from mercury seed-dressings, and deaths through road traffic, barbed wire (Holt&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2013) and overhead wires (Tucker and Heath 1994) are not insignificant (Holt&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2013). These threats still persist despite its protected status in most countries (König 2008). A significant decline in Mediterranean countries in the 1960s is thought to be due to the effects of myxomatosis on rabbit populations (Holt&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2013). Egg-collectors impose a relatively high level of nest-robbing on the species (Tucker and Heath 1994).","In Europe, the   breeding population is estimated to number&#160;18,500-30,300 pairs, which equates to 36,900-60,600 mature individuals&#160;(BirdLife International 2015).

This time period includes some time in both the past and the future. Causes of this reduction (which have not ceased) include continuing decline in area, extent and quality of habitat, severe forest fragmentation, and exploitation through unsustainable levels of hunting and live-capture for the illegal in-country pet trade.&#160;Based on these premises, the species is listed as Endangered, though it will likely be considered Critically Endangered in the near future.</p><p></p>","<p>The Ring-tailed Lemur’s marked ecological flexibility allows this species to colonize a diverse range of habitats in southern, south-west, and south-central Madagascar including gallery, littoral, and dry deciduous forests, spiny bush, brush and scrub, high-altitude ericoid bush and rocky outcrop vegetation (Sauther <em>et al.</em> 1999, Goodman<em> et al. </em>2006, Gould 2006, Cameron and Gould 2013, Gould and Gabriel 2014, LaFleur <em>et al.</em> 2014, LaFleur and Sauther 2015). Indeed, at the upper portion of its elevation range on Andringitra, the species occurs in a zone above the forest line and in a vast expanse of vertical rock, with up to 400-m tall talwegs, surrounded by ericoid savanna. It encounters the most extreme climatic conditions on the island from the hottest and driest (Tsimanampesotse) to the coldest (Andringitra Massif). It has a varied diet, and does not seem to be constrained by available water sources (Goodman <em>et al.</em> 2006), although when available does drink water daily (LaFleur, <em>per obs.</em>). Ring-tailed Lemurs are cathemeral and can be active at any time of the day or night, although they seem to avoid night time activity when overnight temperatures are low (Donati <em>et al.</em> 2013, LaFleur <em>et al.</em> 2014). This is the best-studied of Madagascar's lemurs; its biology and ecology have been summarized most recently by Jolly <em>et al.</em> (2006), Gould (2006), Mittermeier <em>et al</em>. (2008), Gould <em>et al.</em> (2011), Gould and Gabriel (2014), and Fardi <em>et al.</em> (2018). </p>","<p>Habitat loss, hunting, and live-capture for the illegal in-country pet trade are the greatest causes of concern. The Ring-tailed Lemur has a strong preference for gallery forests for <em>Euphorbia</em> bush, and rocky outcrop rupicolous forest, but these habitats are already restricted in southern and south-central Madagascar and continue to diminish due to annual burning practices that help create new pasture for livestock. Subsequent over-grazing and harvesting of <em>Euphorbia</em> for livestock, and the felling of trees for charcoal production further impact wild populations. This species is also hunted for food in certain areas and frequently wild-captured and kept as a pet.<br/><br/>Furthermore, due to more frequent droughts in the southern regions compared with past decades, this species is increasingly threatened. Hannah&#160;<em>et al</em>. (2008) predicted that a mean temperature increase of 2.6°C will occur in southern Madagascar in the 21<sup>st</sup> century, and that arid regions in southern Madagascar will become further desiccated, which will have important and largely negative biological consequences for flora and fauna inhabiting this geographic area. Cyclones, severe storms and flooding also affect this species (see LaFleur and Gould 2009). Moreover, range shift predictions based climatic models for Madagascar suggest that ring-tailed lemurs will experience a net loss of 63% of available habitat simply due to climate change alone (Brown and Yoder 2015). </p>","<p>The population of this species is suspected to be undergoing decline, with individuals are now largely restricted to completely isolated or relatively isolated fragments throughout their geographic range, and overall population densities have been noted as low (Sussman <em>et al</em>. 2003, Gould and Sauther 2016). There is a suspected population reduction of ≥50% in this species over a three-generation period (36 years, estimating the generation length to be 12 years). This time period includes some time in both the past and the future. Causes of this reduction (which have not ceased) include a continuing decline in area, extent and quality of habitat, severe forest fragmentation, and exploitation through unsustainable levels of hunting and live-capture for the illegal in-country pet trade.</p><p>There are only eight remaining known populations that have more than 100 individual Ring-tailed Lemurs (LaFleur <em>et al</em>. 2018). These are: 1) Amoron’i Onilahy Protected Area, 2) Andringitra National Park, 3) Anja Community Reserve, 4) Berenty Private Reserve (and surrounding forest fragments), 5) Beza Mahafaly Special Reserve (Parcels one and two), 6) Isalo National Park, 7) the “Lost Forest” (Ihorombe Region of the Ihosy District), and 8) Tsimanampesotse National Park. Some of these populations are well-protected and unlikely to be extirpated (e.g. Berenty Private Reserve, Anja Community Reserve), or are relatively safe from localized extinction because of the difficult nature of the landscape (i.e. Andringitra National Park). However, other locations are subject to pressure from hunting (i.e. Amoron’I Onilahy), and live-capture for the within country pet trade (i.e. Tsimanampesotse). Fire also presents a risk to Ring-tailed Lemurs (e.g. Isalo, Tsaranoro Valley, and Lost Forest), as does the loss of genetic diversity resulting from population isolation. This species is shown to be negatively impacted by habitat fragmentation (Eppley <em>et al.</em> 2020).</p><p><br/>The following lists population counts and/or densities at sites where ring-tailed lemur populations have recently been counted. These sites represent only a fraction of the geographic range, yet give a ‘snapshot’ of the status of some of Ring-tailed Lemur populations in 2018 and illustrate that the overall population of this lemur is low, and that most populations occur in small fragmented forests (see Gould and Sauther 2016, LaFleur <em>et al</em>. 2017).<br/><br/>In Berenty Reserve, the population density is 2.5 individuals/ha in the gallery forest, 5.0 individuals/ha at the tourist front, and 1.3 individuals/ha in the scrub and spiny forest (Jolly <em>et al.</em> 2002, 2006, Koyama <em>et al.</em> 2002, Pride 2005, Gould <em>et al.</em> 2011). A total number of 280 individuals in approximately 20 ha have been counted in Berenty Reserve (Razafindramanana 2011, Jolly <em>et al.</em> 2006). In the Bealoka fragment of Berenty Reserve, the population density is 1.67 individuals/ha (Razafindramanana 2011). A total number of 167 individuals in approximately 100 ha have been counted in this fragment (Razafindramanana 2011).<br/><br/>In Cap Ste. Marie, the population density is approximately 0.017 individuals/ha (Kelley 2011). It is not known if this population still exists. At the last confirmed sighting (2018) there were fewer than 50 animals and they were subsisting in extremely degraded habitats and subject to hunting pressure or possibly retaliatory killings (Kelley, <em>pers comm.</em>)<br/><br/>In Tsimanampetsotsa National Park, the population density is 0.10 individuals/ha. Two groups inhabit a 195 ha area of the park (LaFleur 2012). Eleven groups have been counted, though the total number of individuals is unknown (M. LaFleur <em>pers. comm.</em>)<br/><br/>In Beza Mahafaly Reserve, the population density is 0.23 individuals/ha. A population density of 1.3 individuals/ha has been recorded in Parcel 1 of the Reserve. In 2001, 104 individuals were counted in a 80 ha area (Parcel 1 of the Reserve) (Gould <em>et al.</em>&#160;2003). In 2006, 225 individuals were counted in a 980 ha area (Sauther and Cuozzo 2008).<br/><br/>On the western edge of Andringitra National Park, WWF guides estimated in 2009 that ~100 lemurs may range in a large area of the park, and 12 were counted at the summit of the Diavolana circuit.<br/><br/>A 2013 census at the 34 ha Anja Community Reserve revealed a total of 210 animals and a population density of 6.2 individuals/ha (Gould and Andrianomena 2015).<br/><br/>In Tsaranoro forest, the population density in 2013 was 1.47 individuals/ha, with a total of 78 animals in 53 ha (Gould and Andrianomena 2015).<br/><br/>In Andranobe community reserve, population density in 2013 was 1.7 individuals/ha. with a total of 30 individuals in 17.4 ha (Gould and Andrianomena 2015).<br/><br/>In the 20.3 ha Samisorany community reserve, 21 animals were noted in 2013 with a density of 1.03/ha (Gould and Andrianomena 2015).<br/><br/>The <em>Lemur catta</em> population at the 7.7 ha Sakaviro community reserve, was 30 individuals in 2013 (density= 1.03/ha) (Gould and Andrianomena 2015).<br/><br/>Five additional populations of <em>L. catta </em>were counted in small forest fragments in the south-central region (250 sq km area), with populations ranging from 6-28 animals, and densities of 0.28 to 5.3/ha. Two of these fragments were seriously compromised by tree cutting and firewood extraction, and the <em>L. catta</em> populations within were considered at serious risk of extirpation (Gould and Sauther 2016).<br/><br/>In the Ambatotsirongorongo fragment, the population density is 1.5 individuals/ha. In 2010, approximately 50 individuals in a 30 ha area were counted (Razafindramanana 2011).<br/><br/>In the Petriky fragment, the population density is 0.004 individuals/ha. In 2012, four individuals were counted in a 920 ha area (N. Malone <em>pers. comm.</em>), but the population is now likely extirpated (Gould and Sauther 2016).<br/></p>",Decreasing,"<p>The Ring-tailed Lemur is found in the dry forests, spiny bush, montane forest, mangroves, rocky outcrops, and one rainforest in southern and south-western Madagascar, and in one humid forest in south-eastern Madagascar. The north-western boundary may be Toliara, although this is currently unknown. Populations north of Toliara and west of Isalo may have been locally extirpated, or have at least become extraordinarily rare due to intensive and prolonged bushmeat hunting (see Goodman <em>et al.&#160;</em>2006, Moniac and Heitmann 2007, Siers 2007, Gardner and Davies 2014). The south-eastern limit ends at the divide between the western and eastern watersheds, which is aligned with the division between western dry and eastern humid vegetation types. All records from the Andohahela National Park are from the extreme western portion, at the ecotone between dry and humid forests. Intensive hunting has taken place here and threatens any remaining individuals or populations of ring-tailed lemurs. The currently known north-eastern limit is Sakaviro Community Reserve, 9 km north-west of the town of Ambalavao. A population also occurs at altitudes up to 2,600 m in the mountains of Andringitra on the south-eastern plateau (Goodman and Langrand 1996, Yoder <em>et al</em>. 1999). A newly discovered population inhabits the humid rainforest, or “Lost Forest”, of the Ihosy District (Ihorombe Region, Wright and Buono, pers comm). A very small population was recorded in the extreme southern region of Cap Sainte Marie in 2007; but it is unknown if this population is currently extant. Throughout the range of this species, its distribution is best described as patchy.</p><p>Range shift predictions based climatic models for Madagascar suggest that ring-tailed lemurs will experience a net loss of 63% of available habitat simply due to climate change alone (Brown and Yoder 2015).</p>","<p>This species is hunted for food (Goodman 2003, Moniac and Heitmann 2007, Siers, 2007, Gardner and Davies 2014) and frequently kept as a pet (LaFleur <em>et al.</em> 2015, 2019, Reuter <em>et al.</em> 2016). In several regions, such as costal and in-land forests north of Toliara ring-tailed lemurs have likely been hunted to extirpation (see LaFleur <em>et al.</em> 2018). Additionally, Toliara, Anakoa, and Fort Dauphin appear to be “hotspots” for sightings of wild-captured pet ring-tailed lemurs (LaFleur <em>et al</em>. 2019). </p>",Terrestrial,"<p>This species is listed on Appendix I of CITES.

There is strong evidence that it is highly mobile between different areas at different times of year (Oliveira <em>et al.</em> 2006). It nests in trees in laurel forest, occasionally on the ground or in cavities in cliffs. Normally only one egg is laid. The species is largely frugivorous, although leaves and flowers are also well represented in its diet: at least 33 different species are taken (Oliveira <em>et al.</em> 2002). It feeds mainly on the berries of <em>Laurus azorica</em> which is the most common tree in the laurel forest (Tucker and Heath 1994). It also eats the fruit of <em>Ocotea foetens</em>, <em>Persea indica</em>, <em>Appolonias barbujana</em>, <em>Myrica faya</em>, <em>Clethra arborea</em> and <em>Piconia exelsa</em> (Zino and Zino 1986, Jones 1988, Tucker and Heath 1994).

This species's unpopularity, as a result of its use of agricultural areas, has a negative influence on conservation and management actions. Hunting and poisoning, as a result of the damage done to crops, continue illegally in a few well-defined areas, especially on agricultural land, and in response to farmers' protests, the regional government authorised limited culling of the species on one occasion in 2004 (Nagy and Crockford 2004).

At night, they emerge from the cave and have been observed up to 10 m above the surrounding ground, on the rock and vegetation of the tower (Grismer&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017). Tadpoles and eggs of this species are completely unknown. Other <em>Ansonia</em> species reproduce in relatively fast-flowing forest streams by larval development, but no open stream has been discovered near the species' known habitat; it may use subterranean water systems, but this is not confirmed (Grismer&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2017). The species has not been observed in disturbed habitat, however recent satellite imagery reveals that much of the land immediately surrounding the tower has been cleared. The same is the case for the other two karst structures adjacent to Phang Nga.","<p>Recent satellite imagery reveals that Khao Chang karst tower is almost completely surrounded by palm plantations. Plantations also extend to much of the edges of the two nearby karst outcrops.

If this species had historically occupied adjacent lowland forest, it is very unlikely that this is still the case, with the vast majority of the surrounding habitat now being highly modified. The clearing and subsequent development of agriculture in lowland areas is known to indirectly affect adjacent karst systems by reducing the fauna that visit caves (including prey of frogs), polluting subterranean water systems, and increasing the risk of fire (Culver <em>et al.</em> 2000, Robinson and Webber 2000, Clements <em>et al</em>. 2006). Limestone quarrying is also considered a major threat to karst biodiversity and is occurring at higher rates in Southeast Asia than other tropical regions (Clements&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2006). Limestone quarrying is ongoing in areas surrounding this species’ only known locality, within Mueang Phan-nga District, and may threaten the species if it occurs outside of this locality (A.

It is found even on tiny, rocky islands, and on the edges of mangrove swamps, and it might be somewhat tolerant of saline conditions. Females congregate in very large numbers in natural caves, and in old bunkers (both concrete and dug-out bunkers) left from the Second World War. Males call from thick grassy patches in disturbed habitats, from depressions under detritus, rocky crevices and outside of caves (Zug and Fisher 2018, R. Crombie pers. comm. August 2018). It breeds by direct development, although the nests are very hard to find and the site of egg deposition is unknown (R. Crombie pers. comm. August 2018). Hatchlings have been observed at nght during a tropical storm, in leaf litter along a small stream (R. Crombie pers. comm. August 2018). On average, males are between 3-4 cm and females are 3.6-5.4 cm (Zug and Fisher 2018).","While not a regular occurrence, typhoons are a threat in Palau and would be a threat to both the species and its habitat (R. Crombie pers. comm. August 2018). Super typhoons Bopha and Haiyan have likely wiped this species on the two largest islands in the Kayangel Atoll in 2012-2013, and should another typhoon occur within its range then this could occur again. The region has experienced near misses with other typhoons that have occurred in the last few decades, prior to super typhoons Bopha and Haiyan (R. Crombie pers. comm. March 2019).&#160;<br/><br/>This species is also predated upon by&#160;<em>Rhinella marina</em> (cane toad), <em>Candoia superciliosa</em> (an endemic boa species) and <em>Dendrelaphis</em> sp. (terrestrial racers) (R. Crombie pers. comm. August 2018); however due to the abundance of this species, predation may not a major threat. <em>Rhinella marina</em> does not occupy all natural habitats where this species is found, but has been observed predating it in towns and mangrove flats, and the snake species have been observed going through trash piles where frogs are known to be found (R. Crombie pers. comm. August 2018). An endemic owl species has also been observed predating upon frogs (R. Crombie pers. comm. August 2018), but there is no information on whether or not it was this species.","It is very abundant, and the population is generally considered to be stable due to its adaptability to disturbed habitats. However two super typhoons (Super Typhoon Bopha and Haiyan), that hit eight months apart in 2012-2013, submerged the Kayangel Atoll in 3 m of water which is thought to have wiped out all terrestrial fauna (R. Crombie pers. comm. December 2018). It is very unlikely that this species still occurs on the two largest islands at this locality now (R. Crombie pers. comm. December 2018), and should another typhoon occur again then it is possible that this will occur in other parts of its range. Prior to this, the last major typhoon to hit Palau was in the mid 1960s (R. Crombie pers. comm.

In Syria its population has declined dramatically over the past 30 years and is probably now extinct as a breeding population. At least 95% of truly wild birds are now concentrated in one subpopulation in Morocco. Numbers have increased owing to management actions and consequent improved breeding success, and potential new colonies have been discovered. Despite these increases the population size is still very small, and so the species is listed as Endangered.<p></p> <p></p>","<strong>Behaviour:&#160;</strong>The small Syrian population is migratory, but the larger western population is dispersive (del Hoyo <em>e<em>t al</em></em><em>.</em> 1992)<strong></strong>. Breeding occurs in colonies of up to 40 pairs, beginning in mid-February, and eggs are laid in March-April (del Hoyo <em>et al</em><em>.</em> 1992)<strong></strong>. Colonies are vacated in late June or early July, but migration and dispersal do not commence until August, with birds recorded on the breeding grounds as late as November (<strong></strong>Cramp and Simmons<em>&#160;</em>1977)<strong></strong>. Some reside in Souss-Massa NP and around Tamri throughout the year (Bowden <em>et al.</em> 2003)<strong></strong>. Juveniles tend to disperse over the longest distances (del Hoyo <em>et al<em>.</em></em> 1992)<strong></strong>. Movements appear to be to some extent determined by rainfall (Hancock <em>et <em>al</em></em><em>.</em> 1992)<strong></strong>. Migrating birds from the Syrian population do not arrive in their Ethiopian winter quarters before December (Cramp&#160;and Simmons 1977)<strong></strong>. All return to their breeding colonies in February and March (Cramp&#160;and Simmons&#160;1977)<strong></strong>. Birds in general are gregarious throughout the year (Brown <em>et al.</em> 1982). The species forages in loose groups with birds well spread out, but commutes in flocks between the colony or roost and the feeding grounds (Cramp&#160;and Simmons 1977)<strong></strong>. Winter flocks vary from a few individuals to over 100 (Cramp&#160;and Simmons&#160;1977)<strong></strong>. Breeding performance is highly variable from one year to the next (Bowden <em>et al.</em> 2003), but does not appear to be related to rainfall in the vicinity of the colonies as previously reported elsewhere. It is suggested that coastal fogs in the Souss-Massa region may buffer the adverse impacts of low rainfall, and may in part account for the year-round residency of the birds<span style=""font-weight: bold;""> </span>(Bowden <em>et al.</em> 2003)<strong></strong>. <strong><br/><br/>Habitat:&#160;</strong><em>Breeding </em>Colonies are usually situated in rocky areas, cliffs and escarpments  in remote arid regions (Cramp&#160;and Simmons 1977)<strong></strong>. In the past castles, ruins and walls were used as nest sites even in urban areas (<strong></strong>Hancock <em>et <em>al</em></em><em>.</em> 1992)<strong></strong>. They are often located near the banks of rivers, along streams or on the coast (<strong></strong>Hancock <em>et <em>al</em></em><em>.</em> 1992). Birds may feed on dry ground and rocky slopes, as well as in wetlands, on coastal sandy strips, on river beds and in sandy banks on the sea shore<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(<strong></strong>Hancock <em>et <em>al</em></em><em>.</em> 1992)<strong></strong>. Roosts away from the breeding site can be in trees, on cliff ledges or sometimes in fields<span style=""font-weight: bold;""> </span>(<strong></strong>Hancock <em>e<em>t al</em></em><em>.</em> 1992)<strong></strong>. <em>Non-breeding </em>During the non-breeding season it may be found in mountain meadows, stubble fields, short grass, rocky semi-arid ground, and damp ground in lower areas of high plateaus (<strong></strong>Hancock <em>e<em>t al</em></em><em>.</em> 1992).<em> </em>It prefers areas with very sparse vegetation, but sometimes frequents pastures and cultivated fields (Aghnaj <em>e<em>t al</em></em><em>.</em> 2001)<strong></strong>. It avoids tilled fields and pastures where the grass exceeds 25 cm in height<strong> </strong>(<strong></strong>Hancock <em>et<em> al</em></em><em>.</em> 1992). Birds that migrate to Ethiopia during the non-breeding season feed on high moors, wet meadows and by fast-flowing mountain streams and lake margins up to 3,500 m elevation<span style=""font-weight: bold;""> </span>(<strong></strong>Hancock <em>et <em>al</em></em><em>.</em> 1992)<strong></strong>. <strong><br/><br/>Diet:&#160;</strong>It has a broad diet, feeding on any available animal life (Aghnaj <em>et <em>al</em></em><em>.</em> 2001) including insects, arachnids, scorpions, earthworms, snails and vertebrates such as fish, amphibians, lizards and snakes, small rodents and small birds, whether alive or dead<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(<strong></strong>Hancock <em>et a<em>l</em></em><em>.</em> 1992). It will also feed on vegetation including berries, shoots, duckweed, and rhizomes of aquatic plants (<strong></strong>Hancock <em>et <em>al</em></em><em>.</em> 1992).  <p></p>","The species has been in decline for several centuries, perhaps partly owing to unidentified natural causes. However, the more recent rapid decline is undoubtedly the result of a combination of factors, with different threats affecting different populations. Hunting was the main threat to the tiny Syrian population, and overgrazing and collecting of firewood have reduced habitat quality in feeding areas, with food availability declining during the pre-dispersal period when the species's nutritional requirements are high (Lindsell <em>et al</em>. 2011). The ongoing conflict in Syria makes it very difficult to assess current threats and whether the species persists there. Prior to the conflict, suspected threats were; construction of a well at a main feeding site;&#160;disturbance from other human activities, and this population was also potentially threatened by trophy hunters, combined with a lack of safe areas with water sources (Serra <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2009). The integrity of the protected area at the Syrian breeding colonies was potentially threatened by oil concessions, infrastructure development and plans for urbanisation (Serra<span style=""font-style: italic;""> et <em>al</em></span><em>.</em> 2009, Murdoch 2010). Satellite tracking of juvenile birds indicates that the main threat to the eastern population was mortality from hunting in the Arabian Peninsula. Three birds tagged in summer 2010 did not survive their first winter (R. Grimmett<span style=""font-style: italic;""> in l<em>itt</em></span><em>.</em> 2011). Breeding productivity in Syria in 2005 was zero: local rangers reported predation as the cause. The most serious nest predator had been Brown-necked Raven&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Corvus ruficollis</span>, however, predation by Egyptian Vulture&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">Neophron percnopterus</span>&#160;on young ibis chicks was also suspected (Serra&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span>&#160;2009). The Birecik subpopulation has also suffered from losses to predation in some years (J. Tavares pers. comm. 2008). At Souss-Massa NP, the most recent causes of breeding failure have been loss of eggs to predators and, more importantly, poor chick survival as a result of starvation and predation (Bowden<span style=""font-style: italic;"">&#160;et al.&#160;</span>2003).<br/>In Turkey, a major historical threat was poisoning and reduced breeding success caused by pesticides used against locusts and mosquitoes (Murdoch 2010). In Morocco, illegal building and disturbance close to the breeding cliffs and changes in farming on the feeding grounds are the threats that may have the most severe impact on the population. A proposed tourist development at the national park could prove detrimental to the birds if it is not constructed in a sensitive way (Anon. 2009). Poisoning was originally suspected to be the cause of death of three tagged individuals found in Jordan, however electrocution whilst standing on electricity pylons is now believed to have been the most likely cause (Anon 2009). On the Ethiopian wintering grounds disturbance of the last few birds, as well as rainfall shortages have been identified as threats in the short-term (Serra <em>et al</em>. 2013). In the longer term, conversion of pastures to crops and increasing use of fertilisers and pesticides are likely to threaten wintering birds (Serra&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2013). Illegal hunting in Italy has been identified as a key threat to birds undertaking human-led migration from captive breeding populations in the Alps (Wald 2014).<p></p>","In Souss-Massa National Park and Tamri, Morocco in 2015, 116 pairs raised 205 fledglings with a total of 580 individuals present at the end of the breeding season (Oubrou and El Bekkay 2015). In 2014, 115 pairs produced 192 young which went on to fledge (Oubrou and El Bekkay 2014). In 2013,&#160;113 pairs (i.e. 226 mature individuals) nested, out of 319 adults, and produced 148 fledged young with a total of 443 birds at the end of the breeding season (Oubrou and El Bekkay 2013, J. F. Orueta <em>in litt</em>. 2016). In 2011, 110 pairs produced 138 fledged young (J. F. Orueta <em>in litt</em>. 2016), matching the breeding success of 2010, when 105 pairs fledged 138 young (R. Grimmett <em>in litt.</em> 2011). After the breeding season the total number of birds in the western population may have exceeded 500 in 2011-2012 (IAGNBI 2012), and almost reached 600 individuals in 2015 (Oubrou and El Bekkay 2015). Only a single mature female returned to Syria in 2013 (C. Bowden <em>in litt.</em> 2013) and again in 2014, but reportedly no birds returned in 2015 (Serra 2015). The last successful breeding record in Syria is from 2011 when a single breeding pair fledged two young (R. Grimmett <em>in litt.</em> 2011). The Turkish population now numbers around 100 individuals (IAGNBI 2012), but these managed birds are excluded from the total estimate. The species is considered Regionally Extinct in Europe (BirdLife International 2015).",Stable,"<em></em>The historical range of the species probably extended throughout North Africa and into the Middle East. However, since the beginning of the 20<sup>th</sup> century the species has been known from two disjunct populations: a western population in <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Morocco</span> and an eastern population in <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Turkey </span>and <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Syria</span>. In Morocco it is found at Souss-Massa National Park (Souss-Massa NP) (338 km<sup>2</sup>, three sub-colonies) and at nearby Tamri (one colony, half the breeding population) (Bowden 1998), with some movement of birds between these two; and in 2017 two new breeding sites were identified (Aourir <em>et al. </em>2017). In 1995, the Moroccan population was estimated at 300 individuals (74 breeding pairs that laid eggs) (Bowden <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et a<em>l</em></span><em>.</em> 2003). In 1998, it had declined to 59 pairs, following the mysterious death of 40 birds in 1996 (Bowden 1998, Touti<span style=""font-style: italic;""> et <em>al</em></span><em>. </em>1999),  but by 2015 there were 116 pairs that laid eggs (Oubrou and El Bekkay 2015). Importantly, since 1980 there has been no overall decline in  numbers at Souss-Massa NP (Bowden <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et <em>al</em></span><em>.</em>  2003). At present the population in Morocco is stable. In 2014, the total number of birds in Morocco was estimated at 524 individuals, with 115 pairs successfully raising 192 young which went on to fledge (Oubrou and El Bekkay 2014); and in 2015 there were 116 pairs, 205 fledglings and 580 birds at the end of the breeding season (Oubrou and El Bekkay 2015). These breeding numbers are the best since detailed records began 30 years ago (Safford unpubl. 2016). There is some cause for optimism that former areas  may soon be recolonised (C. Bowden<span style=""font-style: italic;""> in litt.</span> 2006), this is supported by observations of groups of up to 12 birds (both adults and sub-adults) in areas within the species's former range (J. F. Orueta <em>in litt</em>. 2016).<br/><br/>The eastern population was believed to have died out, however in 2002 a tiny colony, consisting of just seven individuals, was rediscovered at Palmyra in Syria (Serra <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et<em> al</em></span><em>. </em>2004). Having barely been rediscovered, this population now looks as though it will once more be lost, with just a single individual returning to the colony in 2013 (C. Bowden <em>in litt.</em> 2013) and again in 2014, and reportedly no birds returning in 2015 (Serra 2015).&#160;Being migratory, the Syrian population is behaviourally distinct from the Moroccan one, from which it is thought to have separated long ago. During the six breeding seasons following the rediscovery (2002-2007), the three, and then two, pairs bred well and a total of 24 chicks fledged and left the breeding area successfully (Serra <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et <em>al</em></span><em>.</em> 2009). Between 2004 and 2007, five immature ibises returned to the colony (Serra <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et <em>al</em></span><em>.</em> 2009). In 2008, breeding failed with four chicks dying, probably due to predation by Brown-necked Raven <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Corvus ruficollis</span> (Hirschfeld 2008). The causes of failed breeding in 2009 are uncertain, but intraspecific disturbance and low spring rainfall are possible factors (Murdoch 2010). In 2011, a single breeding pair fledged two young (R. Grimmett <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in li<em>tt</em></span><em>.</em> 2011), but the same pair failed to breed in 2012 (C. Bowden <em>in litt. </em>2012). Searches in 2003 for further colonies within the Syrian steppes proved fruitless (Serra <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et a<em>l</em></span><em>.</em> 2004). <br/><br/>Satellite-tagging has revealed that the Syrian population migrates south through <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Jordan </span>and <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Saudi Arabia</span>; six birds spent three weeks in <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Yemen </span>(July-August), then wintering in central <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Ethiopia</span>; migrating back to Syria, through <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Eritrea</span>, <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Sudan</span>, Saudi Arabia and Jordan in February (Lindsell <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span><em>.</em> 2009); with very few individuals located in Ethiopia in the winter over recent years (Serra and Wondafrash 2009), with the most recent sightings being three adults in winter 2014 (Bowden 2014) and only one individual seen since 2015, which is suspected to have come from Syria (C. Bowden&#160;<em>in litt.&#160;</em>2017).&#160;Records of untagged birds in <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Israel </span>and <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Djibouti </span>in late 2007 may relate to immature birds from the Syrian colony or birds from an as yet undiscovered population (Hirschfeld 2008). A semi-wild population numbering 91 individuals in 2006 exists at Birecik, Turkey (J. Tavares <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in<em> litt</em></span><em>.</em> 2007), where birds are free-flying for five months, breeding on natural nest sites and nest-boxes on cliffs, but are taken into captivity after the breeding season to prevent them from migrating (G. Eken <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in<em> litt</em></span><em>.</em> 2005, J. Tavares <span style=""font-style: italic;"">in<em> litt</em></span><em>.</em> 2007). Three birds from the colony migrated in 2009 travelling via the Palmyra site. However, three were found dead in Jordan (Niemann 2009). In 2013, six individuals were selected to remain in the wild and at least five of these migrated south in August stopping very close to the Palmyra site (C. Bowden <em>in litt. </em>2013). However in September 2013 the birds moved westwards towards Homs and a few days later all three tagged birds stopped transmitting (Bowden 2013), for unknown reasons, but hunting and electrocution on power lines are possible causes of mortality.<br/><br/>Historically, the species occurred across parts of southern Europe, and reintroduction projects are underway for a migratory population in <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Austria </span>and<span style=""font-weight: bold;""> Germany&#160;</span>(numbering c.30 individuals [Wald 2014]) which has been successfully trained to winter in Tuscany, Italy (Waldrappteam 2014a, b); and the reintroduction a more sedentary population has been initiated in Andalusia,&#160;<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Spain</span>, with a long-term aim to re-establish the species (C. Bowden <em>in litt</em>. 2016). There are currently around 1,200 studbook registered individuals in European zoos (Wald 2014) and probably a further 800 unregistered birds of Moroccan origin (C. Bowden <em>in litt</em>. 2016). Around 190 birds were released in Spain between 2004 and 2009 (Boehm and Bowden 2010), and in 2008 a released pair laid two eggs, perhaps the first breeding of the species in the wild in Spain for 500 years (Hirschfeld 2008). Up to 24 breeding adults were present on three breeding cliffs in 2013 (Jordano and Márquez 2013) and 25 breeding pairs in 2014 (UvA Bird Tracking System <em>undated</em>). However, predation by eagle-owls has meant a near-complete breeding failure there in 2017 (J. F. Orueta <em>in litt. </em>2017,&#160;M. Quevedo <em>in litt. </em>2017), and the population is not yet self-sustaining, with yearly restocking releases (A. Cunningham <em>in litt</em>. 2017). There have been some sightings of some Spanish re-introduced individuals crossing to Morocco (e.g.&#160;Muñoz and Ramírez 2017), although these predominantly appear to be hand-reared juveniles (Bowden <em>et al. </em>2018).<p></p>",,Terrestrial,"<strong>Conservation Actions Underway</strong><br/>CITES Appendix I. CMS Appendix I and II. In 1999, an international advisory group IAGNBI was created to coordinate efforts and provide scientific advice (Bowden 2001)<strong></strong>. The IAGNBI met in August 2016 (Boehm and Bowden 2016, C. Bowden <em>in litt</em>. 2016). The eastern sub-population is listed as Critically Endangered in the regional Red List for the Arabian Peninsula (Symes <em>et al. </em>2015). An international species action plan was published in 2006. An African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbird Agreement (AEWA) International Working Group was established in 2012 and a revised International Single Species Action Plan (ISSAP) for the Conservation of the Northern Bald Ibis was approved by AEWA in 2015 (C. Bowden <em>in litt</em>. 2016). The revised ISSAP has four objectives to be achieved by 2025: increase reproductive success; reduce adult/juvenile mortality; establish new colonies; fill key knowledge gaps (Bowden 2015).<br/>Over 1,000 individuals of the western population exist in captivity worldwide, but birds from the eastern population are much rarer in captivity (four Turkish zoos hold 20 birds and participate in an <em>ex situ</em> breeding operation&#160;[Böhm 2004]). An international studbook was discontinued in 1998<strong> </strong>(Böhm 2004). An <em>in situ</em> breeding programme at Birecik aims to establish a partially captive population of 150 birds to provide birds for release to the wild population if this action is agreed in future <span style=""font-weight: bold;""></span>(Böhm 2004)<strong></strong>. Supplementary feeding is conducted for the Turkish population, but there is no evidence that this increases productivity (Yeniyurt <em>et al. </em>2017). Colour-ringing of young at Birecik has begun and there were plans to attach satellite transmitters to a family party in July 2007 (J. Tavares <em>in <em>litt</em></em><em>.</em> 2007)<strong></strong>. A captive breeding centre has been built at Ain Tijja-Mezguitem, north-eastern Morocco, and is stocked with zoo-bred birds imported in 2000 and 2004 (WAZA www.waza.org). In 2004, an information centre was also constructed. Six pairs bred in 2006 and successfully reared six offspring. In 2007, the aviary contained 19 birds (13 adults and six juveniles). The centre was closed in 2016 with the remaining birds transferred to Rabat Zoo (J. F. Orueta <em>in litt</em>. 2016). A reintroduction was planned once the population has reached around 40 birds (WAZA www.waza.org). Other captive breeding schemes exist or are planned in Austria, Spain and Italy, and programmes of releasing captive birds are either in progress or in the experimental phase in Bavaria, Spain, and Italy (N. Schaffer <em>in li<em>tt</em></em><em>.</em> 2007, UNEP/CMS 2008, Fritz 2010)<strong></strong>. In southern Spain, a total of 190 birds were released between 2004 and 2009 (Boehm and Bowden 2010). Although juvenile mortality has been high, the first breeding pair was formed on nearby cliffs in 2008. A small independent non-migratory colony is now becoming well established in the area (Matheu <em>et al</em>. 2014).&#160;There are two introduced populations in the Alps, totalling 30 individuals, in Burghausen (Germany) and Salzburg (Austria) (Wald 2014). These birds have undertaken human-led migration to Orbetello Lagoon in Tuscany, Italy and in 2011 the first wild bird independently migrated from Italy to Burghausen (Waldrappteam 2014a). There have been experimental field studies of the feeding ecology of hand-raised individuals in potential summer and winter habitat in Europe (Zoufal <em>et <em>al</em></em><em>.</em> 2006)<strong></strong>. An EU LIFE+ project was initiated in 2013 (Waldrappteam 2014b). The primary objective of the project is to re-establish migratory breeding colonies in Germany and Austria which will winter in Italy. A small breeding colony already exists in Burghausen (Germany) and a further two colonies are to be established in Kuchl (Austria) and Uberlingen (Germany) (Waldrappteam 2014b). By 2019 the colonies should consist of at least 119 individuals (Fritz 2014). The project also aims to reduce illegal hunting of the species in Italy (Anon. 2014).&#160;In Turkey, efforts have focused on increasing the semi-wild population through better husbandry, and now awareness-raising activities are ongoing, targeting locals and particularly farmers, focusing on the ecological importance of the species and the negative effects of using pesticides (Hatipoglu 2009, C. Bowden <em>in litt</em>. 2015).<br/><br/>In 1991, the Souss-Massa National Park was designated specifically to protect nesting and feeding areas<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(Bowden <em>et al.</em> 2003) and in 1994, a monitoring and research programme was set up involving local people (Bowden 1998)<strong></strong>. The provision of freshwater near the breeding colonies in the national park has been shown experimentally to increase productivity, buffering individuals against the impacts of low rainfall, and is now an ongoing conservation measure (Smith <em>et al.</em> 2008)<strong></strong>. The Palmyra project in Syria has initiated a research and protection programme in collaboration with local communities, however the current security situation means any work on the species is very difficult. Three birds were satellite-tagged there in June 2006 (Anon. 2006)<strong></strong>, and one in 2007; giving an indication of the migratory route of Syrian individuals. Syria's first local conservation society, the Palmyra Society for the Protection of Environment and Wildlife, aims to develop ecotourism in the area (Anon. 2008)<strong></strong>. The breeding area in Syria was declared a protected area in 2004 by Ministry of Agriculture and Agrarian Reform. It was also declared as an IBA by BirdLife in 2007. Ecotourism and awareness raising has been promoted throughout the range. Conservation action to date has focused on reducing the negative influences on breeding success, but it is recognised that for such a long-lived bird, adult survival is also likely to be an important limiting factor on the population size. Plans to release young birds from the Birecik colony in Syria during 2009 were halted by delays in obtaining permissions from the Turkish authorities, although it was hoped that this would be possible in 2010<strong> </strong>(Anon. 2008). Five birds were released from the Birecik colony in 2013 and fitted with satellite tags but these birds were lost over Syria and future releases halted to prevent further losses (Safford unpubl. 2016).<br/><br/><strong>Conservation Actions Proposed</strong><br/>Conduct research into feeding and breeding biology, and habitat requirements (Brindley <em>et al.</em> 1995), and investigate (safety concerns allowing) whether the eastern subpopulation persists.

Breeding starts in April on barren offshore islands, where breeding pairs occupy cliffs, caves and boulder fields (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1992). Breeding individuals in the Canary Islands show a unimodal foraging strategy, concentrating on highly productive regions of the African continental shelf (Navarro and González-Solís 2009). Diet is mostly squid, which are obtained mainly by surface-seizing. The species is regularly attracted to trawlers to feed on offal (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1992).","The primary threats to this species include interaction with small- (and large-) scale fisheries, and predation by invasive, non-native species. Together with <em>C. diomedea</em>, it is the main seabird species caught as bycatch by the Spanish longline fleet in the western Mediterranean (Báez <em>et al.</em> 2014). A study by Ramos <em>et al.</em> (2012), utilising long-term capture-recapture data and year-round tracking data for birds on Selvagem Grande, suggests that incidental bycatch by longline fisheries contributes to a decrease in adult survival probability during the breeding season. The species may also suffer the impacts of bycatch in its non-breeding range (e.g. Granadeiro <em>et al.</em> 2006). In addition, fledglings suffer direct persecution on the Canary Islands, with negative effects on breeding success (Lopez-Darias <em>et al</em>. 2011), and c. 500-1,500 chicks poached annually on the Azores (Fontaine <em>et al.</em> 2011). A range of invasive predators are present in the species’ range, but their impacts have largely been unaccounted for. The effect of rats on the species not fully understood. In some colonies a high abundance of rats has been shown to have significant negative effects on reproductive success, while in others the opposite effect has been found and is attributed to the rats providing an alternative food source for cats, thereby reducing pressure on chicks (Thibault 2005). Pascal <em>et al.</em> (2008) found a substantial difference in breeding success of Cory’s Shearwaters in areas with (0.82%) and without (0.45%) rat control (see also Thibault 1995). Feral cats <em>Felis catus</em> predate large numbers of juveniles and chicks in colonies on the Azores and Madeira, however the impact on breeding success has not been comprehensively assessed (Hervias <em>et</em> <em>al</em>. 2013). Predation of eggs and chicks by House Mice <em>Mus musculus</em> is thought to cause slow but significant reductions in breeding success in parts of the range (Hervias <em>et al</em>. 2013). In one colony, chicks are predated by Madeiran Wall Lizards <em>Teira dugessii</em> which have been recorded in up to 10% of nests, but no overall impact on breeding success has been found (Matias <em>et al</em>. 2009). Lizard predation appears to be a local phenomenon and is highly unlikely to have an impact on the species on a population level. Light pollution, and consequent grounding, predominantly of immature individuals, is another threat contributing to the slow, steady decline of the species across its range (Fontaine <em>et al</em>. 2011).","The European population is estimated at 252,000-253,000 pairs, which equates to 504,000-507,000 mature individuals (BirdLife International 2015).",Unknown,"This species breeds in the Azores and Madeira (&gt;85% of the  global population, plus a few pairs on the Berlengas Islands off the Portuguese mainland), <strong>Portugal</strong>, and on the Canary Islands, <strong>Spain </strong>(c.15% of the global population [Granadeiro <em>et al. </em>2006, Derhé 2012]). The vast majority of the population spends the non-breeding season in the Atlantic.<br/>A population  recovery is reported for Selvagem Grande (Savage Islands, Madeira archipelago), the largest colony of Cory's Shearwaters in the world, with an  estimated increase of 4.6% per year since 1980 (Granadeiro <em>et al. </em>2006).  This follows a series of mass culling events in the 1970s, carried out  by Portuguese and Spanish fishermen, which reduced the colony by c.90%  from c.140,000 pairs. Since 1977, strict protection has been enforced  and the population started a steady recovery; however, between 1995 and<em> </em>1998  a decline of more than 13% was reported, before monitoring work was  interrupted. Following fieldwork in 2005, the colony was estimated to  number c.30,000 pairs (Granadeiro <em>et al. </em>2006), which implies  an overall decline of c.110,000 pairs since the mid-20th century.  Following the surveys in 2005, it was estimated that assuming an annual growth  rate of 5%, it would take another 35 years for the colony to reach its  numbers prior to the culling events (Granadeiro <em>et al. </em>2006). The largest colony in the Azores is on the island of Corvo, where the latest population estimate was &gt;6,000 pairs (3,735-10,524) in 2012; however, the colony may have been much larger in the past (Oppel <em>et al</em>. 2014).<br/><p>The population trend is difficult to determine owing to gaps in the data, and is therefore considered unknown according to the European Red List of Birds (BirdLife International 2015).

However, rapid  declines have been reported in the Azores (43% decline during 1996-2001; Bolton 2001) which may be caused by  inter-annual variation in colony attendance (Jenouvrier <em>et al. </em>2005), along with behavioural differences between census years (Bolton 2001, Fontaine <em>et al. </em>2011).

In Spain, sporadic counts of breeding populations  occur in some colonies, mostly in the Balearic Islands, but in the  Columbretes counts are more regular. Reproductive success is also  monitored in the Chafarinas (Madroño <em>et al</em>. 2004). A study of the  incidental mortality of seabirds in waters around the Columbretes  Islands (SEO/BirdLife, General Secretariat of Fisheries) found high  numbers of this species were killed by longline fisheries; however,  mortality could be reduced by avoiding setting lines around sunrise and  sunset (Belda and Sanchez 2001).

Actively managing the breeding colonies  (eliminating predators, recreating the breeding habitat) and removing  predators from the former breeding colonies to promote the natural  return of the species, will also help secure the species. The proper use  of corrective measures in longline fisheries to avoid accidental  capture of birds should be promoted and specific corrective measures to  prevent accidental capture of the species in longline fisheries should  be developed, in collaboration with the fishing industry. Marine areas  which are important for the conservation of the species should be  designated SPAs. Assessments of the environmental impact of new  developments and activities that are planned need to be established. National censuses of this species should be conducted and breeding colonies monitored to determine accurate population trends. Water sports in the vicinity of  breeding colonies should be regulated, especially at night, in order to  avoid disturbing the birds. The regulation of artificial lighting in the  breeding areas and adjacent coastal areas is important to minimize their impact  particularly on young birds at the time of fledging (Madroño <em>et al</em>. 2004).",Afrotropical|Neotropical|Palearctic,,false,false,Global

Neither generation length nor the scale of declines throughout this snake's global range are well-known, however, it has been listed as Critically Endangered in two major areas within its range due to localized declines greater than 80% over a ten-year period, and exhibits apparently high but unquantified rates of decline throughout its distribution. This snake is conservatively estimated to have declined by at least 30% over the past ten years across its global range as a result of over-harvesting for a variety of uses, to some extent compounded by the effects of habitat loss, and with the drivers of this decline not having ceased. It is therefore listed as Vulnerable.","The Burmese Python is mostly found  in forested areas, including mangrove forests and rainforests,  but is also found in grasslands, marshes, streams and rivers, including the Tonle Sap wetland in Cambodia. It is found in wet rocky areas  near streams and pools, large rotting logs, large burrows, caves,  crevices and old and ruined structures. It has been found inside villages, outside houses, in Cambodia (T. Neang pers. comm. August 2011). It is a good climber and an expert  swimmer. It is more nocturnal than diurnal. It feeds on small to  large mammals, birds, reptiles and amphibians, preferring to mostly feed  on mammals. Breeding occurs in India between December to February after which larger females  lay between 80-100 eggs in the months of March and June (Daniel 2002,  Whitaker and Captain 2004). Gestation in captivity lasts four months, and eggs have an incubation period of 60 days (Reed and Rodda 2009). In common with almost all snakes, the species reproduces sexually. Exceptionally, however, a female in captivity isolated from males produced viable eggs in five consecutive years; genetic evidence confirmed that the offspring were genetically identical to the mother, making the Burmese Python the only boid snake known to exhibit parthenogenesis (Groot <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>2003). The snake is unusually cold-tolerant for a python, including subtropical areas of China within its native range, and hibernates to survive the winter (B. Stuart and M. Auliya pers. comm. August 2011).<br/><br/>Observations from Indonesia suggest that this species prefers more arid environments than the Reticulated Python, with which it is sympatric through most of its range. This ecological niche partitioning allows the two species to exist in syntopy, although the Burmese Python is the rarer of the two around human habitations (M. Auliya pers. comm. September 2011).<br/><br/>Captive animals reach sexual maturity at 2-3 years of age with a regular food source (Reed and Rodda 2009), with males maturing earlier than females; generation length in the wild is unknown, but is expected to be at least as long and likely longer. <br/><br/>The introduced subpopulation in Florida thrives in the wet habitat of the Everglades.","This species is under threat due to illegal trade; in China it has been heavily impacted by overexploitation for food and skins, the latter for use both in leather and in traditional musical instruments such as Erheen, Sanxian and hand drums (CITES 2011) and Vietnamese populations are under pressure from a combination of use in food and leather production, export to supply the pet trade, and consumption in snake wine. Similar pressures are presumed to account for the rarity of this species throughout the remainder of its range, for which no quantitative data is available. The subspecies <em>Python b. progschai</em>, which has a restricted range in southern Sulawesi, is of some interest in the commercial international pet trade, and may be vulnerable to exploitation, the type specimen having been recorded in a trader's collection (M. Auliya pers. comm. September 2011, Jacobs <em>et al.</em> 2009). Despite its designation as a protected species in this country, populations in China exhibit no evidence of recovery, and illegal harvesting is ongoing (M. Lau pers. comm. September 2011). <br/><br/>Habitat degradation through slash and burn agriculture in upland areas (Q.T. Nguyen pers. comm. August 2011) may pose a risk by eliminating this snake's prey and making it more vulnerable to exploitation by humans (T. Neang pers. comm. August 2011).<br/><br/>Ironically, this is an invasive species that is firmly established in southern Florida, USA, and poses a threat to the ecosystem there by consuming native wildlife (Snow <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>2007, Dorcas <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2012).","This species has declined across its native range through harvesting for the skin, traditional medicine and pet trade, as well as habitat degradation.

The Vietnam Red Data Book estimates a decline in this species of more than 80% over 10 years in this country (Dang <span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al.</span> 2007). This snake is now very rare in mainland China, as it is heavily exploited for food and skins, with population declines estimated at 90% over ten years (Wang and Xie 2009), although it remains common in Hong Kong where it is a protected species. No population data is available for this species in any part of its Indonesian range (M. Auliya pers. comm.

It is common in Thailand, where its protected status is well-enforced (T. Chan-ard pers. comm. August 2011). Although rates of decline are not available for many areas of this snake's range, the observation that it is declining throughout its native range and the scale of declines reported from China and Viet Nam justify a conservative estimate of population declines over the past 10 years in excess of 30%, and potentially close to or exceeding 50% over the preceding ten years, with declines ongoing due to heavy exploitation and, to a lesser degree, habitat loss.",Decreasing,"<span style=""font-style: italic;""></span>This species occurs from India, where it has a very disjunct distribution and is known from only two small, isolated areas in the northeast, through Nepal to Indonesia and China (including Hainan).

The species is predominantly insectivorous (Straight and Cooper 2012, Cleere and Kirwan 2018). It breeds generally from mid-April to July, although commencement of breeding varies according to location, with individuals in the south of the breeding range starting even in early March, whereas in the north of the range breeding may not start until mid-May (Cleere and Kirwan 2018).

These include habitat degradation due to urban development, and the species’s habit of utilising roads for dust baths <em>etc.</em> at night means it is at risk from collisions with cars (see Straight and Cooper 2012).

It has also been suggested that changes in habitat may be bringing the species more into contact with competitors, such as Eastern Whip-poor-will. As the latter’s range alters it may potentially be causing indirect impacts on Chuck-will’s-widow, although there is little direct evidence for this currently (see Straight and Cooper 2012), and Eastern Whip-poor-will itself is thought to be declining moderately rapidly (Rosenberg&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2016), so it is highly unclear whether this species is having any impact on Chuck-will's-widow, and as such is not coded as a threat here.","Partners in Flight (2019) estimated the global population of mature individuals at 5,700,000.",Decreasing,"<em>Antrostomus carolinensis</em>&#160;is a migratory species that is considered generally common, breeding in eastern <strong>U.S.A.</strong>,&#160;locally in southern <strong>Canada</strong>&#160;(extreme southern Ontario), and in the northern <strong>Bahamas </strong>(see Cleere and Kirwan 2018).

166527449,19757,Rousettus obliviosus,Vulnerable,B1ab(iii)+2ab(iii),2020,2016-05-30 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"The species has a limited range; both its extent of occurrence and area of occupancy are less than thresholds of 20,000 km² and&#160; 2,000 km², respectively (the minimum convex polygon including all three islands it inhabits is 9,085 km², and the total area of all three islands it inhabits is 1,783 km²). It is also known to exist at no more than ten locations (seven consistently-used roosting caves are known), and it is experiencing a continuing decline in the extent and quality of its habitat (due to increasing human pressures leading to substantial loss of native forests; ongoing loss of trees from plantations, orchards, and agroforestry areas; and increasing human disturbance at roost sites). Thus, the species is listed as Vulnerable under B1ab(iii)+2ab(iii).","The Comoros Islands harbour a distinct forest type of tropical moist broadleaf forest, part of the ‘Comoros forests’ ecoregion (Olson <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2001), which formerly served as the foraging habitat for <em>R. obliviosus</em>. However, nearly all large patches of this forest type, except in some higher elevations, have been destroyed. In parts of the remaining forest, the understory has been replaced by banana plantations, taro, or clove trees. <em>R. obliviosus </em>has been widely recorded as occurring in native forest, underplanted forest, and heavily-degraded forest within agricultural zones (Clark <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 1997, Sewall <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2003, Goodman <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2010b). These records, and the presence in its diet of fruit from cultivated, non-native trees (Sewall <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2003), suggest that this species has thus far been able to exploit human-dominated landscapes – including agroforestry lands and orchards, as well as agricultural landscapes retaining remnant trees and forest patches – as foraging habitat. <em>R. obliviosus</em> has not been observed in villages or towns (Sewall <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2003, Goodman <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2010b).<br/><br/><em>Rousettus obliviosus</em> is a cave-roosting species that is only known to roost in caves and shallow rock shelters in areas infrequently visited by people (Sewall <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2003). The species appears to be selective in roost sites, as it has been found in &lt;20% of surveyed caves (Middleton 1998, 1999; Sewall <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2003; Hume and Middleton 2011; Middleton, pers. comm.; BJS, pers. obs.). Roosting habitat is either large lava tubes that are difficult to access or cave localities or shallow rock overhangs associated with streams or waterfalls in remote areas with steep terrain or dense vegetation (Sewall <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2003). Availability of such roosting habitat appears critical for this species. The lack of suitable roosting habitat on Mayotte may explain the absence of this species there (Goodman <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2010b) even though the species is capable of traversing open water over distances equal to that between Mayotte and its nearest neighbour, Anjouan (Goodman <em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em> 2010a).","<em>Rousettus obliviosus</em> has a limited range; its area of occupancy is less than the total area of the three islands (Sewall <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2003), which is 1,783 km² (Louette <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2004), and its extent of occurrence (including unsuitable ocean areas between the islands) is less than 9,085 km². It is therefore susceptible to single threatening processes, like cyclones, that could simultaneously or rapidly affect its entire range.<br/><br/>The major threat to the species within this range appears to be disturbance at roost sites. The bats appear highly susceptible to human disturbance, and infrequent hunting and rock falls in unstable lava tubes have been recorded at roost sites (Middleton 1998, 1999; Sewall <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2003). Additionally, cave surveys between 2000-2005 revealed the bats were absent from three caves where they apparently formerly occurred (Sewall <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2003, W. Masefield, pers. comm.), though it is unclear whether this suggests intermittent use of some roost sites or abandonment after disturbance.<br/><br/>Over the last few decades, the Comoros have undergone a sustained, rapid deforestation, resulting in the loss of nearly all its native forests. During the past 20 years alone, the country has lost 75% of its remaining forests, the fastest rate of any country in the world (UNDP 2013). Human pressures on native forests are expected to continue, as the growth rate of the human population remains high at 2.5% (UNDP 2013). Because <em>R. obliviosus</em> is regularly recorded in human-modified landscapes, loss of foraging habitat via deforestation is possibly not a major threat (Bergmans 1994). However, even human-modified landscapes containing non-native and remnant native trees are disappearing in the Comoros to make room for ground crops (FAO 2010, BJS pers. obs.); thus food resources for this species have probably been declining in recent years. Further, the loss of natural and underplanted forests may reduce its ability to cope with droughts and cyclones, and may limit its access to food resources when fruit from horticultural species is unavailable (Sewall <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2003). In addition, the replacement of native forests with agricultural land on Anjouan and Mohéli may render formerly inaccessible roost sites on Anjouan and Mohéli more easily reached, possibly exposing roosts to increased levels of human disturbance. Finally, the loss of native forests has resulted in impermanence or complete drying of nearly all rivers on Anjouan and most on Mohéli (Louette <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2004). <em>R. obliviosus</em> roosts on those islands are typically near waterfalls, and it is unclear whether that is simply where suitable caves and rock shelters occur or if the bats benefit from the adjacent water source. The species could benefit from an adjacent water source if, for instance, local humidity reduces evaporative water loss in the normally hot climate of the Comoros. If so, then it is possible the seasonal or year-round loss of water flow could affect this species on Anjouan and Mohéli as well.","<em>Rousettus obliviosus</em> is rarely observed outside of research studies due to its nocturnal foraging and cryptic roosting habits. It has nonetheless been captured frequently by bat researchers (Reason <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 1994, Clark <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 1997, Sewall <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2003, Goodman <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2010b), and thus the species is considered fairly common (Reason <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 1994, Louette <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2004, Goodman <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2010b). The true population size is unknown. The only abundance estimates available are from roost counts, and very few roost sites are known. Sewall <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> (2003) searched Grande Comore, Anjouan, and Mohéli and found or confirmed five permanent roosts plus a sixth that was intermittently used. They estimated that colony size at roosts ranges from around 100 to several thousand animals, and that the total population of these six sites was between 7,100 and 17,100 bats (Sewall <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2003). Since then, two additional roosts have been discovered, one small (~100 bats) and one mid-sized (~2,000 bats) (Hume and Middleton 2011, I. Saïd and W. Masefield pers. comm.). Thus, the current population at known roosts is estimated to number about 10,000 to 20,000 bats. Estimates of demographic parameters from genetic analyses suggest recent population stability in this species (Goodman <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2010a). Further, no genetic population structure is evident among the three islands, despite separation of at least 40 km of open water between adjacent islands; this indicates inter-island dispersal (Goodman <em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em> 2010a).",Unknown,"<em>Rousettus obliviosus</em> has been recorded only from the three islands of Grande Comore, Anjouan, and Mohéli of the Union of the Comoros, western Indian Ocean (Sewall <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2003, Louette <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2004, Goodman <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2010b). The species has been recorded from 30-1,750 m on Grande Comore, from 200 to 1,350 m on Anjouan, and from 10-700 m on Mohéli (Meirte 1984, Reason <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 1994, Sewall <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2003, Goodman <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2010b). Since the highest points on these islands are 2,361 m, 1,595 m, and 790 m, respectively (Battistini and Vérin 1984), and since diverse canopy rainforest or cloud forest habitat is replaced by tree-fern, scrub, grassland, or heath habitat above 1,800 m on Mt. Karthala on Grande Comore (Louette <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2004), the bat species probably occurs from near sea level to about 1,800 m on Grande Comore, and across most of the elevational ranges of Anjouan and Mohéli. These records also suggest that the area of occupancy is less than the total area of the three islands (Sewall <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2003), which is 1,783 km² (Louette <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2004). Likewise, these records suggest that the extent of occurrence is less than the total area of the three islands and intervening unsuitable ocean habitat, which is 9,085 km². The species is apparently absent from Mayotte, the other large island in the Comoros Archipelago, as it has never been observed there despite extensive searching and trapping effort (Sewall <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2003, Louette <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2004, Goodman <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2010b).",Infrequent hunting has been recorded.,Terrestrial,"<em>Rousettus obliviosus </em>receives the highest level of legal protection available in the Union of the Comoros. It is listed as an ‘integrally-protected species’ (list 1 of RFIC 2001), which prohibits the capture or detention of <em>R. obliviosus</em> individuals without a permit. This law also expressly prohibits the killing of members of the Family Pteropodidae (flying foxes); transport, purchase, sale, export or re-export of living or dead individuals or their body parts; all disruption during the period of reproduction and raising of young; and the destruction of roosts (RFIC 2001). The Union of the Comoros also ratified the <em>Convention on Biological Diversity</em> in 1994, and in response has developed a <em>National Biodiversity Conservation Strategy </em>(Roby and Dossar 2000). This strategy highlights the importance of, threats to, and conservation recommendations for fruit bats of the Union of the Comoros (Sewall and Granek 2000). In practice, however, there are currently no direct conservation actions in place for <em>R. obliviosus</em>, and no formal terrestrial protected areas in the country.<br/><br/>The national <em>Conservation Action Plan</em> for <em>Pteropus livingstonii</em> (Sewall <em>et al.</em> 2007), another threatened pteropodid from the Comoros, includes an appendix for the conservation of <em>Rousettus obliviosu</em>s. This appendix addresses current and potential emerging threats to <em>R. obliviosus</em>, and recommends five targeted conservation actions for <em>R. obliviosus</em>. Specifically, it recommends (1) protection of roost caves, especially the caves with the largest known colony on each island (these are now thought to be Panga Chilamouinani near Fassi on Grande Comore, Bakomdrundru near Ndrondroni on Mohéli, and Mangua Mitsano near Limbi on Anjouan); (2) discouraging, through environmental education, the hunting of all fruit bats; (3) conducting a comprehensive field search for more roost sites; (4) providing incentives to individuals owning land near roost sites to conserve caves and bats; and (5) devising a suitable population monitoring protocol and conducting regular visits to all known roost sites to track population changes (Sewall <em>et al.</em> 2007). Other key actions for this species include efforts to prevent further native forest habitat loss and additional studies designed to track the species’ population and inform its management (Sewall <em>et al.</em> 2003).",Afrotropical,,false,false,Global

The Caribbean region shows evidence of climate warming at regional (Peterson&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2002, Stephenson&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2014, IPCC 2018) and local scales (Burrowes&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2004, Bhardwaj&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2016). Precipitation patterns are not as clear, but some studies have shown a significant drying trend (Nurse <em>et al.</em> 2001, Neelin&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2006, Bhardwaj<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2016). The frequency of extreme events like hurricanes, heavy rains, landslides, and droughts has increased significantly in the last decade (Méndez-Lázaro&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2014, Oppenheimer&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2019) and may continue to rise in the future (IPCC 2014, 2018).&#160;Sea level rise is an additional threat to this species (Oppenheimer <em>et al. </em>2019, Puerto Rico Red List Workshop 2020). Due to characteristics intrinsic to its biology and physiology, patterns of recent climate change in the Caribbean are expected to be unfavorable to this species.&#160;Climate warming and drought have been associated with a decrease in arthropods (Lister and Garcia 2018), an important food item for frogs; however, there have been doubts regarding the methodology used by Lister and Garcia (2018) (see Willig<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2019).&#160;<br/><br/>The effects of climate change can also be associated with an increased risk of disease (Longo<em>&#160;et al.</em>&#160;2010).

Global and regional population  trends are difficult to determine, as the species is decreasing in some  range states (sometimes dramatically) whilst increasing in others.  Overall, it is not believed to approach the threshold for the population  decline criterion of the IUCN Red List (i.e. declining more than 30% in  ten years or three generations). For these reasons, it is evaluated as  Least Concern.","In the summer, both maternity colonies and males predominantly occupy  roosts in buildings, such as attics, voids behind sheathing and shutters  etc. It sometimes roosts in ventilation shafts of buildings or joints  in bridges. It prefers summer roosts which offer diverse microclimate,  so that the animals can choose their location according to the outdoor  temperature. Individual, mostly male serotines occasionally use tree  caves or nesting boxes (Baagoe 2001, Simon <em>et al.</em> 2004, Dietz <em>et al.</em>  2009). Nurseries usually consist of 10-60 female, but colonies of up to  300 females have also been reported. Sometimes there are also male  colonies with up to 20 individuals . Serotines hibernate mostly in deep  cavities in buildings at the distance of 40-50 km from a summer roost,  but records from underground sites are also quiet frequent (Dietz <em>et al.</em>  2009). <em>E. serotinus</em> is an edge and open-area specialist. It can glean  insects from vegetation or the ground but the predominant foraging  strategy is aerial hawking (Baagøe 2001). It usually forages around and  in the canopy of trees. In open pastures, it can fly close to the ground  or up to 20 m with sudden steep dives. The species often feeds along  roads and around street lamps. Main prey taxa are associated with  semi-open and open habitats such as meadows and pastures with tree  groups, hedges or woodland edges. The distance to foraging sites can  reach 5–7 km, but usually serotines spend around 90% of their foraging  time at distances smaller than 2 km from the maternity roost. A high  percentage of traditional feeding sites is used by the colonies in  subsequent years Faecal analyses of the serotine bat in different parts  of its European range revealed predominantly Coleoptera (e.g. Aphodius,  Melolonthinae, Necrophorus), Lepidoptera, Diptera, Trichoptera,  Hemiptera and Hymenoptera (see Kyheröinen <em>et al.</em> 2019 for the  review of literature). It is fairly sedentary bat species, with  movements up to 330 km recorded (Havekost 1960). It is known to attain  24 years (Steffens <em>et al.</em> 2007).","In Europe affected by habitat loss and disturbance and destruction of  colonies in houses and in underground hibernation sites. Renovation and  refurbishment of buildings, especially churches, lead to losses of  quarters and roosting possibilities. It also suffers from the  agricultural intensification due to loss of insect-rich meadows and  pastures as hunting grounds through abandonment of free-range farming,  more frequent mowing, increased fertilisation or conversion into arable  land. Loss of hunting grounds due to increased agricultural use (e.g.  through maize cultivation, energy crop cultivation, monocultures and  consequent disappearance of hedges, borders and small-scale structured,  insect-rich cultural and open landscapes is also a significant threat in  developed countries (Simon <em>et al.</em> 2013). The species is at high  risk of collisions with vehicles (Fensome, Mathews 2016). It is  sensitive to light pollution at daytime roosts, commuting routes,  drinking sites and in hibernacula (Voigt <em>et al.</em> 2018).The species  is a host of the rabies-related virus EBLV1. There is increasing  interest in the occurrence, risk to humans and epidemiology of this  virus (e.g. Stantic-Pavlinic 2005), which could have an effect on the  public image of this house-dependent bat.","In the EU, conservational status was favourable only in Pannonian  biogeographical region, whereas it was unfavourable-inadequate in  Alpine, Atlantic, Black Sea, Boreal, Continental, Mediterranean and  Steppic regions  (EEA 2013).

In the Mediterranean area they can use grasslands, but  avoid arable land and maquis. However, in Portugal they use farmland  (olive and cereals), avoiding montado with denser tree cover and  favouring areas close to the roost. In some populations pregnant and  lactating females forage over white street-lamps. In France, feeding  areas are commonly located within 30 km of the main roost, while in  Portugal 82% of females forage within 10 km of the colony. In France,  each female foraged over an area of 18.5 ha in Franche-Comté, 7.5 ha in  the Rhône Valley. Females moved from one good feeding area to another  during the night: from 3 patches within a 500 m radius of a roost to up  to 6 patches 4 km away and demonstrated fidelity to feeding areas over  at least short periods, whereas juveniles changed their feeding areas  every night. Lactating females foraged farther from the roost than  pregnant females. Their home range was 22,318 ± 7,141 ha vs. 10,837 ±  5,399 ha in the Rhône Valley. The foraging area of maternity colonies  was <em>ca</em> 200,000 ha. Lepidoptera dominated in the diet in all seasons and  comprised 76–95 % of the volume. Diptera (mainly Tipulidae in late  summer) was the second main prey in France versus Neuroptera in  Slovenia. Prey also included larvae of Lepidoptera and Aranaeidea, as  well as taxa flying close to vegetation. According to a DNA barcoding  study, Geometridae and Noctuidae were the most represented families of  the lepidopterans. Dipterans were the second most consumed prey. Several  taxa of Coleoptera, Neuroptera, Orthoptera and Trichoptera were also  recorded. Prey also included many pest arthropod species (see Kyheröinen  <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2018 for the literature review). Schreiber's bat is  a migrant species which changes its roosts several times during the  year, long-distance movements occur occasionally (the longest recorded  distance is 833 km: Hutterer <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2005). The maximum known age is 22 years (Gazaryan 2004).","The main threat to this bat is disturbance to colonies, both in winter and summer  roosts. Unsuitable physical protection of cave entrances (e.g. with  improperly designed grilles) may lead to abandonment or decline in  numbers. In 2002, mass mortality events were reported for populations in  France, Spain and Portugal, there are also historical records for such  mortality in Italy. Hundreds of individuals were found dead in spring.  Mortality up to 60% in one year was reported from France (Roué, Némoz  2002), and 40% mortality occurred in Spain during the same period  including 1,000 dead individuals out of 6,000 in one colony. A number of  sites were subsequently deserted. In 2013, a mass-mortality incident  occurred in a <em>Miniopterus schreibersii</em> bat colony, causing the death of ~500  individuals in Northeast Hungary (Bükk mountains). Mortality events in  Spain and Hungary were both associated with the Lloviu virus (Kemenesi <em><em>et al.</em></em>  2018). Another event with <em>ca</em> 200 casualties of uncertain origin was  reported in 2018 from Georgia (EUROBATS 2018).

The common colony size is about 40 females which  frequently change tree roosts, while roosts in buildings are occupied  for a longer time. Males may also form summer colonies of up to 200  individuals roosting in various underground and overground shelters  (Simon <em>et al.</em> 2013). It winters in a wide range of underground  habitats, sometimes forming large clusters on cave walls and roof.  Seasonal movements between winter and summer roosts are mostly within a  distance of 100-150 km (Hutterer <em>et al.</em> 2005). The longest  distance covered is 304 km for males and 261 km for females, the maximum  age 30 and 22 years respectively (Steffens <em>et al.</em> 2007). <em>M.  daubentonii</em> is associated with aquatic habitats, where it preys either  on the wing or trawls the water surface with its feet and/or its wing  membrane. Feeding areas are usually at a maximum distance of 2–5 km from  the roosts, but may occasionally be as far as 10 km away from the  roost. Females tend to forage closer to their roost than males.  Altitudinal habitat segregation between sexes was described for this  species across the European and Caucasian range: males tend to occupy  upstream areas and females exploit more productive habitats at lower  elevations Feeding areas of pregnant and lactating females are typically  small.

Maternity colonies are most often found in old houses with large  attics. Favourite roosting place is on or above the ridge beam or behind  rafters. Bats can be found in these roosts throughout the year, though  numbers are higher in the summer. The nurseries usually comprise 10-30,  but in some cases also up to 180 females. Besides buildings, <em>Plecotus  austriacus</em> hibernates in cellars, caves, mines and other types of  underground hibernacula (Simons <em>et al.</em> 2012).<em> Plecotus austriacus  </em>forages above meadows, uncultivated fields, unimproved meadows, marshes,  in open forests and at forest edges and in more urbanised areas, such  as orchards and parks.

Nonetheless, the population of this species in Lao PDR found in Hin Namno National Park (Phiapalath 2009, Timmins and Khounboline 1996) was previously large but has declined during the past 15 years due to heavy hunting and especially after 2006 when a WWF project ended. Habitat fragmentation is not an issue for the species but hunting for food and trade continues to be a threat. The current assessment of primate in Hin Namno NP shows that there is only 1,046±410 individuals or 0.19 individual/km (Minh <em>et al</em>. 2019), much lower than that of 0.42 individual/km from a decade earlier (Phiapalath 2009). Similarly, populations of this species in other places face the same hunting pressure and are declining accordingly.","<p><span class=""None"">This species is typically found in forested habitats associated with karst/limestone environments (Pham Nhat 2002, Nadler 2013). In Viet Nam Ha Tinh Langurs are usually found in limestone areas with dense forest cover such as the habitat in Phong Nha – Ke Bang National Park. They prefer caves and cliffs as sleeping sites, locations that are thought to provide protection from predators (including humans). According to Nadler (2013) cliffs that are used as sleeping sites range from 20 to 60 m in height and specific sleeping sites can sometimes be identified by dark yellow and brown marks that occur directly below cause by urine and feces of the resting Langurs. In Lao PDR, the species is associated with both limestone and non-limestone rock outcrops on steep or precipitous mountain slopes.&#160; Some of this habitat is less heavily forested than that of Viet Nam (Duckworth <em>et al</em>. 2010). Ha Tinh Langurs have been reported in areas of up to 1,500 m asl. <br/><br/>This species is highly folivorous; a feeding study in a semi-natural 20 ha enclosed area in Phong Nha – Ke Bang reported a diet consisting of 81% leaves, 9% fruit, 9% vines, and 1% flowers (Nadler and Brockman 2014, Nguyen Van Truong 2013). This species is primarily arboreal but also spends time on steep karst cliffs and mountain sides (Haus <em>et al</em>. 2009, Nadler <em>et al</em>. 2003, Nguyen Manh Ha 2006). <br/><br/>Ha Tinh Langurs are usually observed in one male – multi-female groups with average group sizes between 6 and 8 individuals although the largest observed group included 30 individuals (Pham Nhat 2002, Nguyen Manh Ha 2006). Births occur through the year but peak in January-June after a gestation of 180–190 days (Nadler and Brockman 2014). <br/><span class=""None""></span></p>","<span class=""None"">The main threat to this species is hunting, as shooting of primates is quite common throughout its range (Duckworth <em>et al</em>. 2010, Nadler <em>et al</em>. 2003). The animals are killed for meat, as well as for traditional “medicine” and the wildlife trade (Nadler <em>et al</em>. 2003, Nguyen Manh Ha 2006, and Phiapalath, 2009). Snaring is reported to be the predominant hunting method in Phong Nha-Ke Bang (Timmins <em>et al</em>. 1999), with an increase since 1996 (Nadler <em>et al</em>. 2003). Hunting with rifles has appeared to diminish since 1995, probably due to gun legislation controls, confiscation of guns by local authorities, and a decrease of hunting success (Nadler <em>et al</em>. 2003). Road construction around Phong Nha-Ke Bang National Park has increased hunting and illegal logging (Nadler <em>et al</em>. 2003). Road construction in Lao PDR within the Langur’s geographic range is also providing easier access for hunters (Duckworth <em>et al</em>. 2010). In Viet Nam, deforestation is another threat. Between 2002 and 2019, Viet Nam lost 54.0k hectares of humid primary forest in the three provinces where Hatinh Langurs occur. The total area of humid primary forest in these three provinces, decreased by about 90% in this time period (GFW 2020).","There is no reliable global population estimate available for this species.<br/><br/>The Phong Nha-Khe Bang area of Quang Binh Province has the largest remaining single population of Ha Tinh Langurs in Viet Nam. Population estimates for the Phong Nha-Khe Bang area have varied over the past two decades; Le Xuan Canh <em>et al</em>. (1997) offered an estimate of 520–750 individuals, Pham Nhat (2002) suggested a maximum of 800, Haus <em>et al</em>. (2009) offered an estimate of 2,143 (± 467) while Nguyen Van Truong (2013) estimated only 150 individuals remained in 2009. An updated survey is needed. Tran Huu Vy (2013) reported that approximately 50 individuals occur in Ke Go Nature Reserve, Nguyen Manh Ha (2006) reported that at least 30 individuals occur in Khe Net Nature Reserve in Quang Binh Province, and this species also occurs in Bac Hoang Hoa Nature Reserve in Quang Tri Province (Nguyen Ai Tam 2012, Nadler and Brockman 2014).<br/><br/>In Lao PDR they occur at least in Hin Namno NP, Nakai-Nam Theun and Koun Xe Nong Ma Protected Areas (Khammouan Province) and Vilabouli District (Savannakhet Province), Phou Xang He, and the southern portion of Phou Hinpoun Protected Area (Khammouan Province) but population estimates are lacking. In Lao PDR, the largest population is likely found in Hin Namno NP and the current population census of primates in the NPA and estimated <em>ca</em> 1,046±410 individuals or 0.19 individual/km (Minh <em>et al</em>. 2019).<br/><br/>Many uncertainties remain concerning the species in Lao PDR including its overall distribution, the number of forms present, their distribution, and their taxonomy. The species presents different morphs across its range in Lao PDR: It was recorded for the first time in Nakai – Nam Theun by camera-traps in 2008 (Duckworth <em>et al</em>. 2010) as in White-cheeked band. The morphology of the animals photographed did not match any of the published description of the different species included in the François’s-group (the morphologically closest being <em>T. francoisi</em>, <em>T. hatinhensis</em>, <em>T. ebenus</em>, and <em>T. laotum</em>). The individuals recorded in Nakai – Nam Theun most closely match the morphology of <em>T. hatinhensis</em>, and all other records of François’s-group animals in Lao PDR (apart from <em>T. laotum</em>, known only from Phou Hin Phoun National Protected Area and surrounds; Steinmetz <em>et al</em>. 2011) were either all black or all-black with white hair line along the top of the ear pinna (in Hin Namno NP: Duckworth <em>et al</em>. 2010; in Vilabouli District, Savannakhet Province: Duckworth <em>et al</em>. 2010; in Koun Xe Nong Ma Provincial Protected Area: Timmins 2018).<br/><br/>Because of the threats this species is facing across its range, any population of distinctive morphology is of conservation importance. The rugged habitat the species is mostly associated with across its range (i.e. karst landscapes), is difficult to access and prevents the application of traditional survey methods to produce statistically robust population estimates.",Decreasing,"The Ha Tinh Langur occurs in limestone areas in north central Viet Nam (the western part of Ha Tinh, Quang Binh and Quang Tri Provinces from 18°00’N, 105°50’E south to 16°10’N, 107°40’E), and in east central Lao PDR (eastern part of Khammouan and Savannakhet Provinces) (Nadler <em>et al</em>. 2003, Nadler 2013, Nadler and Brockman 2014) and it possibly overlaps with <em>Trachypithecus laotum </em>in the latter province.

Approximately 50% of the global range of this small bat is found in eastern North America, subpopulations in these part of the range have been devastated by white-nose syndrome, a fungal disease caused by an introduced pathogen. This disease was first detected in North America in 2006, and to date has caused &gt;90% overall decline in known numbers of hibernating <em>Myotis </em>bats in several areas of Canada and the US. The current range of the disease has been expanding at an average rate of 200-250 km per year. At that rate, the entire population is likely to be affected within 12 to 18 years. There is no apparent containment of the northward or westward spread of the pathogen, and proper growing conditions for it exist throughout the remaining range.","Little Brown Bats inhabit forested lands near water, but some subspecies can be found in dry climates where water is not readily available. In those habitats, drinking water is provided by moisture on cave walls or condensation on the fur. This species occurs over a wide latitudinal and elevational range, but tend to be more abundant in areas with suitable hibernation sites (Wilson and Ruff 1999). They feed mainly on aquatic insects such as caddis flies, mayflies and midges, sometimes, they eat mosquitoes too. This is a species most commonly found flying around houses in North America.<br/><br/>During the winter, hibernation time depends on altitude and location of  the roosts. It usually starts between September and November and ends in  March to May. They do not migrate long distances for hibernation  roosts. Individuals travel only up to 100 miles. This species does not show territoriality at roosts, and large colonies  of as many as 300,000 bats have been reported in a single roost (Barbour  and Davis 1969). The lifespan of this species is extended by their  ability to find food and inhabit a variety of roosts. These  characteristics allow expansion of their habitat to new ranges, but also  contribute to their survival.&#160;<em>Myotis lucifugus</em>&#160;lives  approximately 6 to 7 years and often live well beyond 10 years. A 31  year-old male was discovered in southeastern Ontario. Evidence indicates  that males tend to live longer than females (Humphrey and Cope 1976).","Major threats to this species at present include a fungal disease known as white-nose syndrome (WNS) affecting hibernating colonies of several temperate bat species, that&#160;has devastated eastern North American bat populations at hibernation sites since 2007 (Frick <em>et al</em>. 2010, BCI 2012).&#160;Wind power is another emerging threat to bats: wind turbines have been shown to fatally impact all bat species in Wisconsin (Arnett <em>et al</em>. 2008). Wind-turbine blades cause mortality through direct impact or through the pressure differential caused by the motion of the spinning blades. More research is under way to better understand bat wind-turbine vulnerabilities, but current studies suggest that bats face the greatest risk during migration from summer foraging sites to wintering grounds (tree bats) or hibernacula (cave bats) (Kunz <em>et al</em>. 2007, Frick <em>et al</em>. 2010). Model predictions for <em>Myotis lucifugus</em> in northeastern US predict 99% probability of functional extirpation by 2026. In addition, these bats use to inhabit attics, roofs, trees, and other areas in close proximity to humans, therefore, homeowners have spent large amounts of money trying to eradicate <em>M. lucifugus</em> from these areas (Fenton and Barclay 1980).","Population size is unknown but <em>M. lucifugus</em> was likely over six million prior to the 2007 arrival of White-nose Syndrome (WNS) to America (Frick <em>et al</em>. 2010). As of 2006, regional mean growth suggested that the northeastern core population of this species was stable or slightly increasing (Frick <em>et al.</em> 2010b), and, pre-WNS population of this species was viable and did not face imminent risk of extinction. This species was considered to be common in much of their range in eastern Canada and northeastern US (Wilson and Ruff 1999), and is still common in Canada outside the range of WNS.&#160;Mortality rates at some hibernation sites have been as high as 90% (BCI 2012).&#160;As emerging science has confirmed, the best available evidence conservatively predicts a 99% chance of Little Brown Bat extinction in the northeastern U.S. by at least 2026, and potentially much sooner depending on the actualized mortality rates that result as the disease continues its rapid spread (Frick <em>et al</em>. 2010).",Decreasing,"<em>Myotis lucifugus</em> is found from Alaska (USA) to Labrador and Newfoundland (Canada), south to Southern California, Northern Arizona, Northern New Mexico (USA) (Simmons 2005). Mexican populations usually listed under this name actually correspond to <em>M. occultus</em>, a distinct species (Piaggio <em>et al</em>. 2002). Little Brown Bats are absent from much of Florida, the southern Great Plains regions of the U.S., southern California, and parts of coast Virginia and the Carolinas (Fenton and Barclay 1980).",,Terrestrial,"Natural hibernacula can be managed to encourage bat use. For example, closing but not sealing the entrance to an abandoned mine not only buffers temperature and humidity, but also reduces disturbance from humans and predators. Eliminating disturbance from humans, except for WNS surveillance, is the best management activity for natural cave hibernacula.&#160;Therefore, avoid entering hibernacula during winter hibernation (October through May) unless conducting approved and permitted management, surveillance, or research.",Nearctic,,false,false,Global

In the Philippines, the species is  dependent on caves (Heaney <em>et al.</em> 1998, Esselstyn <em>et al.</em>  2004) where it forages over the canopy in secondary and primary lowland  areas, including agricultural areas (Taylor 1934, Sanborn 1952, Heaney <em>et al.</em> 1991, Rickart <em>et al.</em>  1993, Lepiten 1995). Captures in harp traps placed in along creekbeds  (including creeks not flowing) have shown that they also fly below the  canopy in closed forests in Timor-Leste and Australia (K.N. Armstrong  unpublished), and foraging beneath the canopy has also been reported in  Papua New Guinea (Bonaccorso 1998). The species may migrate seasonally.  In Australia, they congregate in the summer months to form maternity  colonies, and disperse again in winter. Mating in Australia begins in  July, and implantation may be delayed, with females birthing a single  young in December. In the southern part of their range in Australia,  bats may go into shallow hibernation, where they rouse frequently  throughout the season to forage. They sometimes congregate with other  species of <em>Miniopterus</em>, and the warm conditions in these shared cave  roosts allows them to extend their southern extent in Australia. They  eat mostly beetles, moths and flies, but spiders can also make up close  to a third of their diet (Churchill 2008). Across their range, the  characteristic frequency of their echolocation calls is between c. 52–60  kHz (Reinhold <em>et al.</em> 2001, Armstrong and Aplin 2011, Pennay and Lavery 2017).","Across its range there are various activities that threaten the integrity of roost sites and disturb colonies, including limestone quarrying, land modification associated with other mining activity, and guano mining. If caves are left intact, individuals may reoccupy roosts when disturbances cease, but in most cases, there is too little information on the size of colonies and long-term trends in colony size to justify an assumption that some disturbances are temporary and have no effect. The removal of natural forest habitat also reduces the foraging habitat of this and other <em>Miniopterus </em>species.","It is generally a common species. Maternity colonies of thousands of  individuals may be encountered (Flannery 1995). In the Philippines, the  species is common in habitat with caves (Heaney <em>et al.</em> 1998). It  is also common in Sabah and elsewhere in Indonesia. The largest summer  breeding colony at Mt Etna in Australia in a limestone cave has been  estimated at over 100,000 individuals, which is estimated as 80% of the  breeding population in Australia. Similar-sized colonies in the tens of  thousands have also been reported in New Britain (Smith and Hood 1981)  and Borneo (Payne <em>et al.</em> 1985).",Stable,"This apparently widespread single species ranges from the Philippines  through the island of Java (Indonesia), Borneo (Brunei, Indonesia and  Malaysia), Sulawesi (Indonesia), Timor (Timor-Leste and Indonesia), the  Moluccan Islands (Indonesia), the Aru Islands (Indonesia), the island of  New Guinea (Indonesia and Papua New Guinea), the Bismarck Archipelago  (Papua New Guinea), the Solomon Islands, Vanuatu, New Caledonia to  eastern Australia, including several Torres Strait Islands.

209530568,12590,Macroderma gigas,Vulnerable,C1,2021,2019-04-29 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"This species is listed as Vulnerable under criterion C1 because total population size is  estimated to be between 4,000 to 6,000 mature individuals with an  overall estimated continuing decline of &gt;10% in 24 years (three  generations) (Woinarski <em>et al.</em> 2014). The recent and likely  future declines are for a variety of identified operating key threats in  most populations across its range. The species comprises several  geographically and genetically isolated populations across northern  Australia (Worthington Wilmer <em>et al.</em> 1994, 1999). There is evidence for declines in the southern-most populations of Queensland (Augusteyn <em>et al.</em>  2018), and in Western Australia there has been loss of some well-known  major roost sites, ongoing and increasing encroachment on natural caves  by mining-related activity and a persistent threat of collapse of  disused mine structures inhabited by the species. The Australian  Commonwealth Government listed this species in May 2016 as Vulnerable  under Australia’s national environmental legislation. This species has  also been upgraded to Endangered in 2017 under Queensland state  legislation.","<em>Macroderma gigas </em>is the second-largest echolocating species of bat in  the world, and the largest in Australia, weighing up to 150 g and having  a wingspan of 60 cm. They are present in a wide variety of habitats,  from the arid, rocky landscapes of the Pilbara region in Western  Australia, to tropical savanna woodlands and rainforests further north  and east. They rely on underground roosts with warm, humid microclimates  to maintain their heat and water balance (they do not enter torpor,  Leitner and Nelson 1967, Baudinette <em>et al.</em> 2000), especially in the more arid regions or at drier times of the year and during breeding (Pettigrew <em>et al.</em>  1986, Churchill and Helman 1990, Churchill 1991, Armstrong and Anstee  2000). As a result, roost availability is restricted to relatively few  subterranean structures, though individuals are sometimes found in old  mines and caves with cooler and drier conditions. Roosts in natural  caves are found commonly in the deeper limestone caves, tower karst and  sinkholes, sandstone formations, granite boulder piles and ironstone  landscapes (Toop 1985, Armstrong and Anstee 2000, K.N. Armstrong  unpublished data).<br/><br/>This species is carnivorous–their diet consists  of small mammals (including other bats), birds, reptiles, frogs and  large insects, though it can vary according to region and the seasonal  availability of some prey types, and the proportion of larger  invertebrates can be high (Pettigrew <em>et al.</em> 1986, Schulz 1986, Boles 1999, Claramunt <em>et al.</em>  2019). They forage either by perching in vegetation and ambushing  passing prey in the air or on the ground, or by gleaning surfaces,  including the ground. Echolocation calls are short and strongly  multi-harmonic, as is typical of the family. They also make several  social calls that are audible to humans (‘chirps’, ‘squabbles’ and  ‘twitters’, Kulzer <em>et al.</em> 1984, Guppy <em>et al.</em> 1985, Pettigrew <em>et al.</em>  1986), though there is an unresolved issue over whether some ultrasonic  non-echolocation calls attributed to them in the Pilbara (McKenzie and  Bullen 2009) are derived exclusively from other cave-roosting bats (K.N.  Armstrong unpublished data). Previous studies in Queensland have shown  that foraging areas were an average of 1.9 km from roosts and 62 ha in  size (Tidemann <em>et al.</em> 1985), though their wing morphology and the  size of some colonies suggests they are capable of a much greater  nightly range (Bullen and McKenzie 2002). Most prey is taken to a  feeding perch in trees, rock overhangs, or cave entrances to be  consumed, and feeding sites can be relatively common compared to diurnal  roost sites.<br/><br/>Females mostly give birth to a single young, although  pregnant females with twins in utero have been trapped in the Northern  Territory (Hanrahan <em>et al.</em> unpublished), and most females breed by two  years of age (Hoyle <em>et al.</em> 2001). Parturition occurs over a month  commencing in mid-October, and young can be shifted to other caves as  caves became warmer as summer progresses. Juvenile bats commence flying  at seven weeks with all young capable of flight by the end of January  (Toop 1985). Females have high fidelity to their natal roosts, with  males having a greater tendency to disperse (Worthington Wilmer <em>et al.</em> 1999). Relatively few breeding sites are known, and most are not explicitly protected or managed (Hall <em>et al.</em> 1997, Armstrong and Anstee 2000, Richards <em>et al.</em> 2008, Worthington Wilmer 2012). Generation time is estimated at 8 years (Woinarski <em>et al.</em> 2014).","A variety of threats to the survival of this species have been  identified as currently operating or having the potential to cause  decline (Woinarski <em>et al.</em> 2014). <em>Macroderma gigas</em> is very  vulnerable to disturbance in its roost sites, and will readily fly into  daylight following the casual entry of the public or searches by  biologists, where it is vulnerable to predation by raptors and general  exposure to the external environment. Some of the known roosts readily  accessible by people are not managed. Bats may not return to a roost for  months or years after trapping activity, depending on how this is  undertaken. The most serious threat is the loss of roost sites, which  can occur from a variety of causes. Renewed interest in economic  reserves of remaining ore beneath historical mine workings has the  potential to cause disturbances and loss of habitat, and there has been  recent evidence of this in the Pilbara region. There is also an  increasing level of encroachment on cave roosts in ironstone habitats by  surface mining and associated exploration activity. The collapse,  flooding and blocking of entrances are realistic sources of potential  catastrophic loss to the large colonies that have been established in  historical and disused gold and copper mines. There has also been recent  evidence that cane toads contribute to the mortality of <em>M. gigas</em>, and  there are other unknown factors that appear to have caused very recent  but patchy declines in the Northern Territory (White <em>et al.</em> 2016). Genetic studies have demonstrated that it is potentially susceptible to cane toad toxin (Shine <em>et al.</em>  2016). Entanglement in barbed wire fences is known to have caused local  declines in the Pilbara after the ongoing entanglement of entire small  colonies (Armstrong and Anstee 2000). Pollution in old mines and an  unidentified herpes virus have also been identified as possible threats  (Woinarski <em>et al.</em> 2014). For the populations at the southern  limits of the species' range, the general paucity of suitable roost  sites, the geographic distance between existing colonies, and the  evident complete lack of gene flow indicates that these populations are  totally isolated and will not be rescued by immigration or recolonised  should local extinctions occur (Worthington Wilmer <em>et al.</em> 1999).  They can be captured inadvertently in pit traps used for small  terrestrial vertebrate surveys, depending on the width of the pit mouth  (Diete <em>et al.</em> 2016).","Population genetic studies showed that while <em>M. gigas</em> is distributed  widely over northern Australia, it occurs as a collection of population  isolates in several regions, including the Pilbara and Kimberley regions  of Western Australia, the Top End of the Northern Territory, and three  groups in Queensland (Worthington Wilmer <em>et al.</em> 1994, 1999). The  structuring of populations is partly a consequence of the highly  philopatric nature of females, which seldom move from their natal  roosts. Further population genetic studies have revealed the effect of  roost philopatry within regions, which also promotes population  structuring on a smaller scale (K N. Armstrong <em>et al.</em> unpublished).<br/><br/>It  is relatively straightforward to make verifiable counts of<em> Macroderma  gigas </em>as they leave their roosts in caves and mines, especially with  video recordings. There has been no systematic approach for census, but  counts or estimates have been made at several extant colonies over the  past two decades. Colonies in natural caves typically comprise isolated  individuals or small groups of up to <em>ca</em> 30 individuals. Disused mines  can provide a refuge for several hundred individuals. The largest colony  has been recorded in a horizontal adit at Pine Creek in the Northern  Territory - historical counts were 1,200-1,500 individuals, but more  recent estimates with video technology gave a count of around 550  individuals. The largest recorded colonies are all in disused mines,  some of which have probably disappeared. Various estimates of total  population size have been advanced based on a combination of counts at  some roosts, plus calculations based on Area of Occupancy, but there is  no robust measure of abundance across the full range (summarised in  Woinarski <em>et al.</em> 2014). Totals differ between authors, with  Worthington Wilmer (2012) suggesting somewhere between 4,000 - 6,000, and  the previous IUCN Red List account containing an estimate of 7,000-9,000  (McKenzie and Hall 2008) - but all agree that there are less than 10,000  individuals in existence.",Decreasing,"<em>Macroderma gigas</em> is endemic to Australia, though there is an unverified  record in Papua New Guinea (Filewood 1983). It ranges across northern  Australia, from the Pilbara and Kimberley regions of Western Australia,  the Top End of the Northern Territory, with scattered colonies in the  Gulf Coastal and Mount Isa Inlier bioregions, the eastern side of Cape  York Peninsula, and a few localities in central-eastern Queensland  (Woinarski <em>et al.</em> 2014). There are many sites in central  Australia where the species has declined since European arrival, as is  evident from historical sightings and subfossil remains, plus numerous  other sites containing fossils (reviews in Molnar <em>et al.</em> 1984, Churchill and Helman 1990, Armstrong and Anstee 2000).",,Terrestrial,"<em>Macroderma gigas</em> occurs on numerous conservation reserves, but there are  also many known colonies that do not occur on lands that are managed  for wildlife or that are subject to scrutiny, including both pastoral  stations and small-scale mining or exploration leases. There is good  potential for effective conservation of this species and ameliorating  declines if efforts can be coordinated under a national recovery and  management plan, and with resource allocation and partnership amongst  government, industry and researchers. A programme of standardised  non-invasive monitoring at key roost sites would be helpful for  informing regional and local management approaches (Armstrong and Anstee  2000; Armstrong 2010, 2011; Woinarski <em>et al.</em> 2014). There is a  need for priority attention on colonies in old, disused mine  adits-requiring scrutiny, protection and repair of sites and solutions  to allow sharing of underground structures between the interest of both  mining and bats. The encroachment of iron ore mining on roost habitat in  Western Australia is well regulated but would benefit from further  information about the effectiveness of buffer zones, the potential for  artificial roost habitat creation (as a measure of last resort), the  size, seasonal occupancy and breeding status of local occurrences in  project areas, and regional context to aid risk assessment and  management. There is also good awareness of the need for unbarbed top  strands of wire on livestock fences in the Pilbara, and mining companies  consider the risk of entanglements for fences on their leases,  particularly around new infrastructure. The outcomes from population  genetic studies need to be part of management and conservation  responses, in particular information about female site fidelity and the  distinctiveness of the population isolates. Postgraduate research into  acoustic ecology is underway and will resolve issues regarding their  acoustic identification. There are several captive colonies in zoos and  wildlife parks, which are bred and managed for genetic diversity. <em>M.  gigas</em> was only recently specially protected under national environmental  legislation in Australia, reversing a previous delisting that has  diverted attention away from this species that is deserving of better  consideration.",Australasian,,false,false,Global

The assumption is that the large distribution and presumed large population size ensures the stability of the species, and if there is, or has been a recent population decline that the magnitude or rate of this decline is not likely to be sufficient to meet IUCN criteria for a threat category. However, it is important to note that due to a lack of broad-scale, long-term population monitoring, there are no hard data to support or reject this assumption.","<em>Chalinolobus morio </em>is found in a wide range of habitats from rainforests to treeless plains (Young <em>et al.</em>  2008). Throughout much of its range it roosts in tree hollows with  colony sizes typically less than 10 individuals. However, in Western  Australia and the Nullarbor Plain it roosts in caves in larger numbers.  It can also form colonies in buildings with roosts of over 1,000 recorded  (Young <em>et al.</em> 2008). Males and females are philopatric to their  natal roosts, but mating occurs when there is inter-colony mixing in  winter when bats disperse away from these summer maternity roosts  (Thomson 2010). Females give birth to a single young or twins. Diet  consists predominantly of moths (Lumsden and Bennett 1995).","In most parts of its range, this species is dependent on trees for  roosting and foraging, and so it is susceptible to habitat loss and  degradation due to an ongoing decline of mature trees, in agricultural  landscapes, native forests and in urban areas. Feral and domestic cats  are known to prey on the species.

There are observations of past hunting activity that have contributed to a decline, possibly on more than one occasion. Although there is no firm evidence of continuing decline, there is evidence for major fluctuations in the population residing at the primary known roost site. Area of occupancy (not including foraging dispersal range) is less than 10 km², the distribution is severely fragmented, and there is believed to be a continuing threat to the major known population through traditional hunting. Unless the species is confirmed to persist in additional parts of its potential range, it is considered to be at high risk of extinction in the near future.</p>","All known contemporary or recent occurrences are in areas of rugged limestone karst with largely intact forest cover. The documented elevational range of <em>c</em>. 500–2,400 m spans the habitat categories of Hill Forest, Lower Montane and Upper Montane Forests. The dentition and other features of the species indicate that it is frugivorous. The individual shot near Taman Village was visiting a fig tree (<em>Ficus </em>sp.) in an old garden area (Flannery 1995).<br/><br/>The two confirmed cave roosts are both associated with precipitous sinkholes that afford some protection from local hunters. At Luplupwintem an adult female was collected carrying a dependent young in May 1992. In PNG the closely related Bare-backed Fruit Bat (<em>Dobsonia moluccensis</em>) also favours inaccessible roost sites in areas where there is a risk of human hunting. However, in northern Australia (Churchill 1998) and in parts of PNG that are remote from human habitation (K.P. Aplin unpublished) they roost in many different situations, including large and small sinkholes, caves, fissures and rock overhangs, tree hollows, and in variable-sized groups ranging from a dozen or so individuals up to congregations of many thousands. There is some landowner testimony to suggest that large congregations are seasonal phenomena, perhaps associated with breeding activity. However, females with newborn young or in advanced stages of pregnancy have also been observed using small caves and fissures, even when larger systems are present in the same local area. Accordingly, it seems likely that <em>Dobsonia moluccensis </em>(and by extension, <em>Aproteles bulmerae</em>) are not restricted by physiological factors to any particular type of roost but select roost sites based on various criteria that includes the risk of predation.<br/><br/>All pteropodids including <em>Dobsonia moluccensis </em>(Dwyer 1975, Churchill 1998) give birth to single young. Gestation period in Australian populations of <em>Dobsonia </em>is <em>c</em>. 5 months and weaning occurs at around 5–6 months of age. Sexual maturity is attained in the second year. Similar parameters can be safely assumed for <em>Aproteles bulmerae</em>.<br/><br/>Nothing is known about patterns of movement in either <em>Aproteles bulmerae </em>or <em>Dobsonia moluccensis</em>. Other similar-sized species of <em>Pteropus </em>are known to travel at speeds of 40 km/hr and to travel several 10s of kilometres to visit preferred food resources. However, many of the relevant studies have been carried out in highly modified landscapes where resources are fragmented and scattered, and the same pattern of dispersal may not apply in areas of continuous forest cover.","Hunting and disturbance in roost sites is the primary threat to<em> A. bulmerae</em>. Large cave-roosting bats are desirable targets for subsistence hunting in PNG because it is sometimes possible to kill many animals in a short period of time, especially if shotguns are available. The population at Luplupwintem was apparently decimated by groups of hunters with shotguns in the late 1970s. The closely-related <em>Dobsonia moluccensis </em>has been observed to abandon a cave roost after a hunting event, presumably to relocate elsewhere in one or more alternative roosts (K.P. Aplin, pers. obs.).<br/><br/>The likelihood of hunting and roost visitation is increased with the development of new roads. Wopkaimin landowners interviewed by Ken Aplin in 2013 reported an increase in the volume of foot traffic between the Telefomin Valley to the north of the Hindenburg Range and Tabubil to the south, and they voiced concerns that this might lead to increased visitation to Luplupwintem, including visits not authorised by landowners. The same informants also mentioned a regular foot traffic across the nearby and largely unpatrolled international border with Papua Province of Indonesia, some it associated with the sale of airguns and ammunition, and potentially of other weapons.<br/><br/>Conditions that adversely affect feeding habitat on a broad-scale have the potential to reduce the usage of local cave roosts. Forests on the Hindenburg Range in the vicinity of Luplupwintem suffered die-back during the El Nino drought of 1997–1998 and some areas were further affected by subsequent wildfires. A large wildfire had swept just north of the Luplupwintem area shortly before 2001 (T.F. Flannery pers. comm.).","In 1992 and 1993 the population at Luplupwintem was estimated to 137 and 160 individuals respectively, based on direct counts of animals leaving the sinkhole (Flannery and Seri 1993). The site has not been assessed by a biologist since that time but in February 2013 Ken Aplin was told by landowners that the population had declined again after Flannery’s last visit, only to recover again, and that the cave once more contained bats. Whether these are Bulmer’s Fruit Bat or the morphologically similar Bare-backed Fruit Bat (<em>Dobsonia moluccensis</em>) is not known.<br/><br/>The Crater Mountain population was extant in 2005/2006 but no individuals have been observed since that time. There is no estimate of population size for the Crater Mountain locality.<br/><br/>It is not known whether or not the populations in the upper Fly River and middle Purari River catchments are extant. However, both regions are remote and receive low levels of human visitation, hence there is no reason to suggest their decline through human action.",Decreasing,"This species is endemic to New Guinea and is recorded only from the eastern half of the island (Papua New Guinea). Living animals have been recorded at two sites in two widely separated localities, and recent skeletal remains have been found in two other areas. The known elevational range of the records now is from <em>c. </em>500 m to 2,400 m a.s.l. and includes areas of Hill Forest and Montane Forest. All known areas of current or recent occurrence are in areas of rugged limestone karst.<br/><br/>It<em> </em>was first described in 1977 from 12,000 year old fossil remains from Eastern Highlands Province of PNG. Unbeknown to the describer, living animals had been collected in 1975 by an anthropologist working in Western Province of PNG. These came from a sinkhole called Luplupwintem, close to the edge of the Hindenburg Wall and at an elevation of 2,400 m a.s.l. The first visit to Luplupwintem by biologists found only a few resident bats which had been visited shortly before by landowners armed with ropes and shotguns. Subsequent visits throughout the 1980s failed to record any bats. Tim Flannery of the Australian Museum and Lester Seri of the Papua New Guinea Wildlife Division (Flannery and Seri 1993) visited the cave in 1992 and 1993 and estimated the population to be 137 and 160 individuals in successive years. In the 1980s and 1990s the species was recorded from two sites in the Star Mountains region but the species is now no longer present.<br/><br/>In 1984 an individual was shot at night over a native garden at Taman Village, in the Telefomin valley (Flannery 1995). This locality is <em>c.</em> 32 km from Luplupwintem which seems an excessive overnight foraging distance from this site. If another, closer roost site is present in the Telefomin area, its location is not yet known. &#160;<br/><br/>In 1995 fresh skeletal remains were collected in Eastern Highlands Province—these were killed by a local hunter at the locality of Huavegemu Cave near the village of Herowana. Subsequently, skeletal remains of two more individuals were recorded in the same area which lies within Crater Mountain Wildlife Management Area (CMWMA) (D.D. Wright pers. comm.).<br/><br/>In 2005-2006 University of Papua New Guinea student Kore Tau examined ten bat-occupied and four unoccupied caves and sinkholes in two distinct localities within CMWMA, twenty kilometers apart (surrounding Herowana and Supa). Among the ten roosting sites, living <em>Aproteles bulmerae </em>was confirmed as present (distinguished by both the lack of incisors and the presence of second digit claw; Bonaccorso 1998) in only one sinkhole near Herowana. This sinkhole is connected to the cave from which hunted remains had come (Wright <em><em>et al.</em></em> 1995). Tau was able to net six individual <em>A. bulmerae</em> at this site, which also hosted roosting <em>Dobsonia</em>. Because the two species co-occurred a count could not be used to estimate the size of the <em>Aproteles </em>colony. At a second nearby sinkhole two possible <em>Aproteles </em>were netted but for these only the lack of incisors was noted, without examination for the developed claw. An analysis of environmental variables to find predictors for <em>Dobsonia</em>/<em>Aproteles </em>occupation indicated that difficulty of human access to the cave/sinkhole was the only solid predictor.<br/><br/>In 2011–2012 Kore Tau and Enock Kale of the PNG Institute of Biological Research searched and netted caves and sinkholes, and interviewed local hunters, at several sites in PNG including the Crater Supa area and sites near Mt. Karimui in Chimbu Province, Mekil-Mt. Stolle in Sandaun Province, and the Huon Peninsula in Morobe Province. They found no evidence of <em>A. bulmerae</em> on these trips.<br/><br/>Between 2011 and 2015 wildlife consultant Ken Aplin found the remains of <em>Aproteles bulmerae </em>in two additional areas of remote limestone karst in southern Papua New Guinea. One of these areas is in Western Province in the headwaters of the Fly River, with a local elevational range of 500–1150 m a.s.l. The other is in Gulf Province in the vicinity of the middle Purari River, with local elevational range of 100–550 m a.s.l. In each of these areas <em>Aproteles </em>remains were found among bones and teeth accumulated in caves by roosting owls (probably the Sooty Owl <em>Tyto tenebricosa</em>). In each case, the remains were judged to be recent, based on geomorphic criteria and the presence in two sites of a small number of recently regurgitated casts (these did not contain <em>Aproteles </em>remains). Two owl roosts were sampled in each of the areas and all roosts produced remains of <em>Aproteles</em>. At the two sites in Gulf Province the <em>Aproteles </em>remains are exclusively unerupted teeth derived from very young bats; the owls were most likely predating young bats left unattended at a nearby maternity roosts (the hunting range of the owls might extend a few kilometres from the roost). The two sites in Western Province contained the remains of subadult bats. In both areas the caves are remote from higher elevation country, hence the <em>Aproteles </em>were residing in areas of Hill Forest habitat. Both areas are characterised by moderately to extremely rugged karst terrain and support large tracts of undisturbed forest. Because of their remoteness it is unlikely that these populations have been subjected to any hunting activity in recent times. Unless they have declined for some natural reason, it is likely that they are extant. The known extant distribution of <em>Aproteles</em>, if limited to the areas immediately around the confirmed sites of Luplupwintem and the two Crater Mountain caves, is probably around 100–200 km².<br/><br/>However, the new records in the Fly and Purari catchments suggest a potentially broader distribution in the hinterland of the Gulf of Papua. Much of this country is extremely rugged karst terrain lying at 400–600 m a.sl., and it is very thinly populated, heavily forested and biologically poorly known. Similar low to mid-elevation karst terrain extends west into the Indonesian province of Papua. The contemporary occurrence of <em>Aproteles </em>in this region requires confirmation.",This species has been severely hunted for meat.,Terrestrial,"The Crater Mountain sites are within the Crater Mountain Wildlife Management Area and there is local community awareness of the conservation significance of this species.<br/><br/>The Luplupwintem site is currently unprotected and the majority of regional landowners seem to be unaware of the conservation significance of this species. Among Wopkaimin people there also seems to be a lack of awareness of the distinction between <em>Aproteles bulmerae </em>and the morphologically similar <em>Dobsonia moluccensis</em>. A failure to differentiate between these species presents a challenge to the effective conservation of the rarer species.<br/><br/>Areas of suitable habitat in adjacent areas of Papua Province, Indonesia, or to the east of Luplupwintem should be surveyed to locate any remaining colonies of this species. The status of the species in the Upper Fly River and Middle Purari River catchments needs to be reassessed and other areas of similar, low-elevation limestone karst in the hinterland of the Gulf of Papua also needs to be surveyed. Initial detection of the species through the examination of owl roost remains is an effective means of survey for the species in previously unsurveyed localities, especially where the location of potential roost caves is not known to landowners.<br/><br/>Efforts should be made to capture and non-invasively sample a small number of individuals at each of the known sites so that genetic methods can be applied to determine the extent of contemporary and past gene flow between the Luplupwintem and Crater Mountain populations, and to derive a long-term perspective on the demographic history of the species.<br/>If the species is found to be genuinely restricted to only a few isolated populations, a captive-breeding and reintroduction programme should be considered.

In recent years, new records of presence based on captures and recordings of its signature echolocation call, along with regional acoustic surveys, have extended the known and possible range of this species. As a result of this new information, and given the lack of identified key threats, this species does not currently match the criteria for listing as threatened.","<p><em>Emballonura furax</em> has been recorded in areas of Lowland Rainforest, Hill Forest and Lower Montane Forest. Acoustic survey data suggest that it can be locally common but it is rarely captured other than by visiting roosts in limestone caves and mining tunnels (Flannery 1995, Bonaccorso 1998, K.N. Armstrong and K.P. Aplin, unpublished data). The spatial pattern of acoustic recordings as well as its wing morphology suggest that it forages in open areas, probably over and amongst canopy. The few encounters with <em>E. furax</em> at roosts have involved small groups of several to a few dozen individuals. The same sites typically contain much larger numbers of <em>E. dianae</em> and/or <em>E. raffrayana</em>. It is not known whether <em>E. furax</em> prefers to roost in deeper chambers of the same cave systems or alternatively, uses a variety of smaller roost types including small rock shelters and fissures. There are no instances of it roosting in tree hollows or epiphtyes but the fact that another sympatric emballonurid <em>Mosia nigrescens</em> uses both cave and vegetation roosts cautions against rejecting this possibility.</p>",The only significant threat to this species is broad-scale deforestation for forestry and the establishment of plantations. Destruction or major disturbance of roost sites might pose a threat if large communal aggregations feature as part of the species’ reproductive behaviour. A significant part of the species range is made up of rugged karst terrain that is unlikely to be subject to large scale clearance or disturbance.,"No population estimates are available, but the species appears to be reasonably common in parts of Papua New Guinea that have been assessed in the past five years using acoustic methods, including multiple localities in Western and Gulf Provinces at elevations between 100 m and 1,500 m asl (K.N. Armstrong and K.P. Aplin, unpublished data). Across the same area, none have been captured in mist nets or harp traps, and only relatively few individuals have been captured inside caves.

A prior record from Passam (near Wewak) in East Sepik Province has been reassessed as <em>E. serii</em> (K.P. Aplin and K.M. Helgen unpublished data). More recently, surveys have recorded some captures and the echolocation call in localities with underlying limestone geology between 50–1000 m in Western and Gulf provinces (K.P. Aplin and K.N.

Within Papua Province, Indonesia, the species has been recorded from the Kapari River of Fakfak District (type locality), Yapen Island, and from Biak Island. Defining the distribution of this species is further complicated by issues of taxonomy and identification of the type. The record from the type locality at the Kapari River suggests that its distribution may extend further west on the southern side of the cordillera in Papua Province, and presence of this species on Yapen and Biak islands suggests that the taxonomic relationships within <em>E. furax</em> and <em>E. serii</em> are not completely understood.<br/></p>",,Terrestrial,Roost sites near Crater Mountain in Chimbu Province fall within the Crater Mountain Wildlife Management Area.

209537564,10160,Hipposideros semoni,Least Concern,,2021,2016-02-14 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"<p><em>Hipposideros semoni</em> is recorded from both Papua New Guinea and northern Queensland, Australia. It has been listed as Endangered since 2001 under national environmental legislation in Australia because of its apparent rarity and past reductions in habitat. More recent views of the Australian population have matched it against Vulnerable (B1ab(iii); Reardon <em>et al.</em> 2010) and Near Threatened (Woinarski <em>et al.</em> 2014). Lack of information was an obstacle to making a clear decision in the latter assessment—area of occupancy is not well known but is possibly <em>ca </em>2,000 km², the number of known locations is thought to be &lt; 10, total Australian population size was judged to be &gt; 10 000 mature individuals, though with the largest subpopulation probably &lt; 1,000 individuals—and population size was not thought to be declining at a rate &gt;30% over a 20 year (3 generations) period. At a global scale, its presence in Papua New Guinea means that it does not currently meet the criteria for listing as threatened. A suggestion that specimens collected from Papua New Guinea are instead attributable to the morphologically-similar <em>H. wollastoni</em> is true for some records listed on GBIF (South Australian Museum accessions M10483–10488 are actually <em>H. corynophyllus</em> and <em>H. wollastoni</em>; T.B. Reardon and K.N. Armstrong unpublished obs.), but not all (e.g. Smithsonian Institution USNM553716 has diagnostic external morphology of <em>H. semoni</em>; K.N. Armstrong unpublished obs.). There is also a recent possible acoustic record from Gulf Province (K.N. Armstrong and K.P. Aplin unpublished data). Thus, while rare and seldom encountered, there is sufficient evidence that <em>H. semoni</em> does occur over a wide area in Papua New Guinea. The species is therefore listed as Least Concern (LC), but it needs to be reassessed following the completion of taxonomic studies. &#160;</p>","<p>This species is found in rainforest, savanna forest, and dry open areas. It roosts in caves and overhangs, mines, old buildings, culverts under roads, and tree hollows (Bonaccorso 1998; Hall 2008). In Australia, it apparently uses the thin strips of rainforest vegetation in riparian zones of major rivers to move out from larger patches of occupied rainforest habitat (K.N. Armstrong unpublished obs.). It is not known to form larger roosting aggregations like other hipposiderids species, instead roosting singly or in small groups of up to ten individuals (Hall 2008). Females give birth to single young around November (Churchill 2008). Females are larger and produce echolocation calls with a lower frequency compared to males. Generation length is around 6–7 years (Woinarski et al. 2014).</p>","<p>Major threats to this species have not been observed to operate but several are considered plausible (Woinarski <em>et al</em>. 2014). Disturbance and loss of roost sites is thought to be a threat but of relatively low risk, with broader scale effects from inappropriate burning regimes and fragmentation and modification of habitat from pastoralism and other land uses more likely to have an effect on the area of occupancy and range of <em>Hipposideros semoni</em> in Australia. Predation by feral cats is also regarded as a threat, albeit a minor one (Woinarski <em>et al</em>. 2014). In Queensland, there was a gradual reduction in vegetation clearing that peaked in 2009, but changes in policy and legislation since that time have once more led to an increase (Maron <em>et al</em>.2015). Such a trend reversal, coupled with inappropriate fire management of native bushland has the potential to result in further losses of habitat for this species. There are no recognised threats in Papua New Guinea.</p>","<p><em>H. semoni</em> is generally considered to be uncommon and occurring at low density because it is encountered rarely, but it can be captured or recorded if targeted in rainforest habitats in Australia (Hall 2008; Reardon et al. 2010; K.N. Armstrong unpublished data). There have been no attempts at census in Australia, and estimates need to consider that animals have been observed seasonally in drier, open woodlands on Cape York Peninsula as well as rainforest patches (Hall 2008). There is opinion that numbers are greater than previous estimates of &lt;2,500 on Cape York Peninsula, and that it is relatively secure in this region (Reardon et al. 2010). For populations further south, there are contrasting views on whether a decline has occurred in the past, and factors that may have caused such a decline have not been demonstrated, but habitat modelling suggests that a decline in the south is likely over the next 50 years (Dennis 2012; Woinarski 2014). </p>  <p>There is no information on population size or connectedness in Papua New Guinea, though numerous surveys in the past five years across several provinces have only produced a single putative acoustic record (Armstrong and Aplin 2011, 2014; Armstrong et al. 2015; K.N.

Given the intactness of much of the habitat in Papua New Guinea, it might have a broad distribution, though occur at low density given that numerous surveys in recent years in several provinces have not produced captures. Acoustic detection in Papua New Guinea, the most efficient way to assess area of occupancy, is hindered by a lack of information on the similarity of its call to other closely related New Guinea <em>Hipposideros</em> (K.N. Armstrong and K.P. Aplin unpublished data). In Australia, the majority of recent records are from the eastern side of Cape York Peninsula, Queensland—Iron Range, Kulla, Oyala Thumotang and Cape Melville National Parks, near Cooktown and south to Townsville (Reardon et al. 2010; Woinarski et al. 2014). There is also a single report of a disjunct occurrence ca 700 km further south in Kroombit Tops National Park (south of Gladstone, Queensland; Schulz and de Oliveira 1995), and an unconfirmed and likely erroneous acoustic record as far south as Maryborough (de Oliveira and Pavey 1995; probably from <em>Rhinolophus megaphyllus</em>).

While this area is in the order of a few square kilometres and would probably allow a match to one of the highest threatened categories under Criterion B, the total number of known and inferred roost locations is greater than 10. </p>","<p></p><p>  </p><p><em>Rhinonicteris aurantia</em> roosts in caves and old underground mine workings in colonies of a few to several thousand individuals. Physiological studies have demonstrated that this species has one of the highest measured rates of pulmocutaneous water loss of any mammal and is unable to enter torpor (Baudinette <em>et al</em>. 2000), and thus it has an obligate requirement for warm, humid roost microclimates that are physiologically benign (Churchill 1991; Armstrong 2001). Deeper caves and mines that have the capacity to support these conditions are relatively uncommon in most rocky northern landscapes, which limits roosting opportunity, area of occupancy, and results in aggregations in relatively few subterranean structures. In the arid Pilbara region, bats will accumulate in the deepest structures during the hottest and driest parts of the year, spreading further afield when wetter conditions provide the opportunity for shallower caves to provide humid microclimates (Armstrong 2001). In the monsoonal north, the humid conditions probably allow more shallow caves to be used, and there have been rare reports of roosting in buildings. A suggestion of tree roosting is often quoted based on the comments of Churchill (1991, 1994), but this has never been confirmed in any population. In the Northern Territory both sexes accumulate into larger colonies to mate, but later in the breeding season many females disappear from known caves, and maternity colonies have not yet been observed in this region. Females give birth to a single young and lactation occurs in the wet season when insect availability is high (Churchill 1994).</p>  <p><em>Rhinonicteris aurantia</em> are strong and highly acrobatic fliers, in contrast to many small hipposiderids bats, and forage in the open around vegetation (Bullen and McKenzie 2002), usually within a few metres of the ground (Churchill <em>et al</em>. 1988). They feed on a wide variety of insects, though mainly smaller moths and beetles and occasional seasonal abundances of groups such as isopterans (Churchill 1994). There is a possibility that they feed on accumulations of small insects at cave entrances (Cramer <em>et al.</em> 2016), possibly accounting for their commonly observed night visitation of underground structures that are not used during the day for roosting. They are normally observed foraging in gullies, gorges and larger watercourses, as well as open woodland and over hummock grasslands (Churchill <em>et al</em>. 1988; Armstrong 2001). </p>  <p></p>","<p>This species is well known to be very sensitive to roost intrusions and capture at roost entrances. Individuals will often vacate a roost following a disturbance, and the default assumption is that roost abandonment leads to higher rates of mortality because alternative suboptimal roosts nearby are less likely to provide suitable microclimates. Large numbers have also been killed by inappropriate cave gating in the past. A significant proportion of museum specimens originated as road kill, owing to their relatively low foraging height and curiosity for lights, which indicates that new roads close to roosts have the potential to deplete local colonies. The greatest threat to the species is the loss of roost sites that now serve as strongholds for a large proportion of the known population through the gradual deterioration and flooding of old mines and the possibility of catastrophic losses from sudden collapses (Armstrong 2001; Woinarski <em>et al</em>. 2014). The growing encroachment of iron ore mining also has the potential to remove roosts and thus area of occupancy in terrains where the species roosts in natural caves. Threats to roosting colonies appear to be of lower risk in the Kimberley and Northern Territory, but there is still the potential for catastrophic loss of large numbers if known important colonies are not managed effectively. While <em>R. aurantia</em> has a generalist diet and appears to use a range of habitats for foraging, widespread degradation of habitat quality around a roost, such as from poor fire management, might reduce colony survivability or place a limit on its size.</p>","<p>The literature contains reports of colonies ranging in size from 20 to 25,000 individuals (Churchill 1991), but the larger numbers have not been verified with a robust counting technique, nor have they been noted in recent years. Large colonies are the exception, with only two currently known, and it is very likely that they number in the low thousands. Based on captures and the non-invasive quantification of activity near roost entrances, typical colony sizes range from a few individuals up to the low hundreds (K.N. Armstrong unpublished data). <em>Rhinonicteris aurantia</em> can appear relatively common in a locality because they are relatively simple to detect, either by active searching with a bat detector and taking advantage of their curiosity for small light sources, or by placing unattended bat detectors at cave entrances and relying on encounters following night visitation of non-roost caves. In reality, detections across an area might derive from widely ranging individuals that originate in a one or a few local roosts (K.N. Armstrong unpublished data). Suggestions of widespread commonality have not always been underpinned by effort to locate roost sites and estimate colony sizes (McKenzie and Bullen 2009), and hence there is still a relatively poor understanding of how limiting roost sites are across regions despite widespread records (Armstrong 2001; Cramer <em>et al</em>. 2016). Populations have not been connected across the Great Sandy Desert for many thousands of years (Armstrong 2006; Armstrong and Coles 2007), and movement within regional populations is probably related to the availability of suitable roosts that allow individuals to saltate across otherwise inhospitable landscapes (Armstrong 2001).</p>",Unknown,"This species is endemic to Australia where it is found in the Pilbara and Kimberley regions of Western Australia, the Top End of the Northern Territory, and north-western Queensland (Armstrong 2008; Churchill <em>et al.</em> 2008).",,Terrestrial,"<p>It is considered to be protected and secure in numerous protected areas in the Pilbara and Kimberley regions of Western Australia, Northern Territory and north-western Queensland, though several of the largest colonies are not in protected areas.

A national conservation plan, incorporating a regional approach to management in the Pilbara region, would assist both mining proponents and government land managers (Armstrong 2001, 2010, 2011), and targeted, collaborative approaches between industry and wildlife managers for active management of stronghold colonies in underground mine workings and caves with colonies of significant size would help reduce the risk of losses from both insidious and catastrophic causes.</p>",Australasian,,false,false,Global

The extent of occurrence of all current records well exceeds 20,000 km<sup>2</sup>, although the area of occupancy could be interpreted as &lt;500 km<sup>2</sup>. &#160;However, the type of habitat present where records exist is extensive, and therefore it is reasonable to infer that <em>O. beccarii</em> remains widespread and is not facing major threats across its distribution. There is no information on population trend.&#160; While this assessment tentatively places this species in Least Concern, if cryptic species are uncovered, then the status of each of the new taxa would need reassessment.</span></p>","<p><span lang=""EN-AU"">All locations where information is available are from coastal or near lowland rivers. &#160;Specimens attributed to this species from the Trans Fly region of Papua New Guinea were collected from hollows in Melaleuca trees (Waithman 1979). &#160;One individual is recorded from a cave near Madang (McKean 1972), although this is thought to be atypical of roosting preference. Bonaccorso (1998) reports that the species is often commensal with people, living in their houses. &#160;Localities for Ambon are unknown. A small series of individuals from Seram Island are from the coastal locality of Solea.</p>","<p><span lang=""EN-AU"">Threats to coastal and lowland habitats include forest clearance for plantations and gardens, logging (both legal and illegal), mining and fire.

These critical roost sites are where the species occurs for  12 hours out of every day. Its range (and population) is severely fragmented as the  roosts are on multiple islands separated by significant water gaps. In  addition, there is a presumed continuing decline in the extent and  quality of its habitat through the loss and degradation of forested  foraging areas and disturbance at caves throughout its range.","This species roosts in caves and mines, with colonies numbering over several  hundred bats. This species forages over forests and feeds mainly on  Lepidoptera, Hymenoptera and Diptera (Fukui <em>et al.</em> 2009). Female give birth single young in early June.","Roost disturbance from humans/tourists (e.g., some caves have  electricity lined in for tourist activities), and the threat of  development around caves represent the main threats. Above several caves  roosted by this species on the Ishigaki island, a new airport has been  constructed. Population monitoring in these caves is conducted every  year before and after construction. However, population trend cannot be  estimated because the number of roosted individuals has highly  fluctuated so far (Kara Karst Scientific Committee 2014, New Ishigaki  Airport Bat Monitoring Committee 2015).","There were many large maternity colonies in the past, but now many appear to have become small or extinct. On Okinawa Island, one maternity colony of 10,000 females is known. On Iriomote Island, a maternity colony with 1,000 newborn youngs is known (Ministry of the Environment 2014).
