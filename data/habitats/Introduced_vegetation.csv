Spawls <em>et al</em>. (2002) indicate that this species' CITES listing is due to concerns that the gecko may be over-exploited for the international pet trade, however, CITES lists the genus as a whole. The organization's documentation considers this particular species to be of 'Least concern' in all territories covered by their review, and notes that trade levels in Tanzania, the only country from which they report recent exports, are unlikely to be a threat (CITES 2006). Recently, however, Tanzania has failed to meet export quotas apparently due to the difficulty in obtaining specimens, and researchers surveying in Tanzania report that the species has become much rarer (C. Msuya and P. Malonza pers. comm. 2014). Illegal trade may also be impacting subpopulations in Kenya, as animals are collected here and exported from Tanzania (S.

Juvenile recruitment is impacted by the combined effects of feral pigs eating incubating eggs and cats preying on hatchlings. These invasive predators must be eradicated in order to solidify the long-term future of the iguana. In addition, removal of the Australian Pine plantation is necessary to restore prime nesting areas. The significant population reduction (&gt;75%) for this species occurred much longer than three generations ago due to the introduction of invasive alien species and periods of settlement for mining, agriculture, and fishing. Some of these threats have not ceased for the remnant population, particularly the impacts of predators. The iguana is endemic to only one island, with an estimated extent of occurrence of 80 km², and qualifies for listing as Critically Endangered.","<p>Mona Island’s climate is a dry subtropical (80 cm rainfall per year) open canopy forest of short, seasonally-deciduous trees, shrubs, cacti, and bromeliads. Rainwater percolates rapidly through the porous limestone substrate, allowing no freshwater streams or ponds. Solution channels and sinkholes that penetrate the island’s rock topography offer underground shelters that are used by both male and female iguanas, and retreats attractive to females are vigorously defended by males. Some males hold territories year-round, while others defend them only during the brief June mating season.<br/><br/>Because more than 95% of Mona’s surface is rock, females must migrate to scarce soil patches for nesting during a two-week, mid-summer season that appears to be cued by photoperiod. Most egg laying (74%) occurs communally in sandy clearings on the island’s southern coastal terraces, with the remaining 26% in sinkhole depressions (Haneke 1995). Mean clutch size is 12 eggs. Surviving eggs hatch approximately 83 days after laying, during the latter half of October. Newly emerged young are large (11.3 cm snout-to-vent length, 74 g) and only the smallest juveniles are susceptible to native predators. Coloration and behaviour of hatchlings suggests that aerial predators have long been a threat to hatchlings (Wiewandt 1977). Males can reach 53 cm in snout-to-vent length (Powell and Glor 2000).<br/><br/>Females are physically able to reproduce at 3.5 years (headstarted), but are more likely to become sexually mature in their fifth to sixth year in the wild. Although longevity records are not available, Mona Rhinoceros Iguanas, like all large rock iguanas, are probably among the longest-lived lizards in the world (&gt;40 years). Generation length is estimated to be 20 years but could be longer. Consequently, populations are slow to recover from losses over time. Mona iguanas are primarily herbivorous, with a strong preference for fruits that fall from native trees. Some animal matter is eagerly eaten, especially caterpillars when available. Trees reach their greatest size and diversity around the edges of scattered sinkhole depressions, areas that are of particular importance to the welfare of the iguana population.</p>","The most pressing threat to Mona Rhinoceros Iguanas today is the persistence of invasive alien species introduced to the island much longer ago than three generation lengths of the iguana. Feral pigs (<em>Sus domesticus</em>) target nest areas and were noted to consume nearly 100% of the eggs (Wiewandt 1977). Presently, camera traps in unfenced nesting sites also show nearly 100% loss (Figuerola-Hernández <em>et al</em>. 2015b). Feral cats (<em>Felis catus</em>) are a known and serious predator of hatchlings on Mona as has been observed for other <em>Cyclura</em>. Iverson (1978) documented the devastating impact of cats on a Turks and Caicos Rock Iguana (<em>Cyclura carinata</em>) subpopulation, and there no doubt that the scarcity of juveniles on Mona observed in previous surveys is due almost entirely to the combined impacts of pigs consuming eggs and cats preying on young. Feral goats (<em>Capra hircus</em>) have influenced the structure and composition of Mona’s vegetation (Rojas-Sandoval <em>et al</em>. 2016), particularly in the recovery period after hurricanes, and may threaten iguanas through competition. Goat have also been observed on camera traps trampling communal nest areas. Invasive Black Rats (<em>Rattus rattus</em>) and House Mice (<em>Mus musculus</em>) are also established on Mona, although their impact on the iguanas is less well understood.<br/><br/>Most recently, a few invasive Common Green Iguanas (<em>Iguana iguana</em>), which have been established on mainland Puerto Rico in very large numbers, have been detected on Mona Island. Although these have been removed (M. Garcia pers. comm. 2019), this represents a new threat for Mona’s iguanas through resource competition, habitat degradation, and possibly hybridization that has been documented between Sister Island Rock Iguanas (<em>Cyclura nubila caymanensis</em>) and invasive Common Green Iguanas on Little Cayman, Cayman Islands (Moss <em>et al</em>. 2018).<br/><br/>In the 1930–40s, large areas in the principal iguana nesting grounds along the southwestern terrace were planted with exotic Acajou Mahogany (<em>Swietenia mahagoni</em>) and Australian Pine (<em>Casuarina equisetifolia</em>). These plantations drastically altered the native plant communities, reduced understory vegetation, promotes erosion, and the closed canopy prevents adequate sunlight for iguana egg incubation. Fallen <em>Casuarina</em> needles create a thick five-cm layer over the sand and have eliminated the availability of these areas for nesting (Haneke 1995, Figuerola <em>et al</em>. 2018).<br/><br/>A significant portion of nesting areas for the Mona Rhinoceros Iguana occur near the coast and in soil depressions. Such areas are particularly prone to flooding during tropical storms and hurricanes, which destroys iguana nests. The Caribbean is predicted to experience significant changes in temperature, precipitation, tropical cyclone activity, and sea level rises due to global climate change (Biasutti <em>et al</em>. 2012).<br/><br/>Although lacking permanent settlements today, Mona is a haven for recreational activities, including camping, fishing, swimming, scuba diving, beach-combing, exploring, and hunting. Most of these activities are concentrated along the island’s sandy coastal terraces and within sinkhole depressions, areas that are of critical importance for iguana nesting. Mona iguanas are wary and easily disturbed while nesting, and visitors can unintentionally disrupt the egg-laying process. People and feral animals walking through nest site clearings during incubation may cause nest chambers to collapse and destroy developing eggs. These and other conflicts between iguanas and visitors are expected to continue as recreational use of the island remains. Mona may have already exceeded its carrying capacity for low-impact tourist visitation. Better supervision over visitors, particularly by strengthening educational programs, will become increasingly important as the number of visitors coming to Mona continues.","The Mona Rhinoceros Iguana population was estimated to be between 2,000 and 4,000 individuals by Wiewandt (1977). Later, Pérez-Buitrago and Sabat (2000) estimated the population at approximately 5,000 total individuals and inferred a relatively stable population from the differences in survey method. However, both surveys noted a particularly low abundance of juveniles (only 5–10% of the population, Weiwandt 1977), as did Moreno who observed only two juveniles among 118 iguanas (1995). This contrasts sharply with unpublished data for the closely related Hispaniolan Rhinoceros Iguanas (<em>Cyclura cornuta</em>) on Isla Beata in the Dominican Republic, where all age classes are similarly abundant and juveniles comprise approximately one-third of the population (Grupo Jaragua 1994). Further, the density of iguanas on Petite Gonâve Island (Haiti) was 26 times greater than observed for iguanas on Mona (0.3–1.4 iguanas/ha, Pérez-Buitrago <em>et al</em>. 2008). Thus, low iguana densities and the scarcity of juveniles on Mona suggested an ageing and slowly declining population. This is considered to be the result of years of predation on hatchlings and eggs by feral cats (<em>Felis catus</em>) and pigs (<em>Sus domesticus</em>) and was later confirmed by research documenting a 22% survival rate for hatchling iguanas during their first five months (Pérez-Buitrago and Sabat 2007).<br/><br/>Small, short-term improvements to the population were achieved in the early 2000s since a headstart program was initiated that has released 263 iguanas to date, at a size safe from cat predation (Figuerola-Hernández <em>et al</em>. 2015a). Survival of headstarted iguanas was at least 40% initially and were later observed breeding (García and Gerber 2016). Although, no current population estimate is available, it is believed the population has slightly increased from surveys in 2000, due to headstarting and other conservation measures. However, today's population size is estimated to be many-fold smaller than that of the 1800s and prior to the introduction of invasive alien species and periods of settlement for mining, agriculture, and fishing (Wiewandt 1977). A systematic population survey was completed in November 2019, that is planned to be repeated in 2020, and again every three to five years thereafter.",Increasing,"<p>The Mona Rhinoceros Iguana is found only on the remote island of Mona (53 km<sup>2</sup>), a protected area administered by the Puerto Rico Department of Natural and Environmental Resources. It is located approximately midway between the islands of Puerto Rico and Hispaniola but it is not part of the Puerto Rican or Hispaniolan Bank. Iguanas can be found throughout the island, but predominantly (95%) on the major escarpments up to the plateau at 80 m asl (Wiewandt 1977). The species has an area of occupancy (AOO) of 80 km<sup>2</sup>, using a 2x2 km grid overlaid across the entire island. The estimated extent of occurrence by minimum convex polygon surrounding Mona is 61.1 km<sup>2</sup>, and adjusted to 80 km<sup>2</sup> to align with the definition of AOO.</p>",All <em>Cyclura</em> species are listed in Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) and protected by the United States Endangered Species Act. The Mona Rhinoceros Iguanas is also classified as Endangered by the Regulation to Govern the Endangered and Threatened Species in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico (DNER 2004).,Terrestrial,"The first planned conservation action aimed to increase the survival of Mona Rhinoceros Iguanas was the installation in 1984 of an exclusion fence on the southwestern coastal plain to protect prime nesting areas from egg predation by feral pigs. This structure was in poor condition for over a decade until it was replaced in 2005 by a fence of much higher quality and with a mesh size that excluded pigs yet allowed iguanas to pass through and nest in historic areas. Similar exclusion fences are needed to protect inland forest nesting areas from pigs as well as goats. Fortunately, a well-attended hunting season has kept the feral goat population from expanding and the timing has been moved outside the iguana nesting and incubation seasons (Joglar <em>et al</em>. 2007, M. García pers. comm.).<br/><br/>An <em>in situ</em> headstart program was initiated in 2000 that boosted recruitment of juvenile iguanas for several years and increased the adult population (García and Gerber 2016). Despite the success of the headstart program, it was expensive and only meant to serve as a stopgap measure. Since the primary threats to Mona Rhinoceros Iguanas are invasive mammals, the focus is now on planning for their eradication. The first step toward this goal was the completion of a feasibility study to eradicate feral pigs, cats, and rats from Mona Island (Island Conservation 2013). In addition to ecological and logistical challenges, a major hurdle will be securing the estimated 8.2 million US dollars required for this necessary eradication.<br/><br/>Recent efforts to remove Australian Pine and restore iguana nesting habitat have met with initial success (Figuerola <em>et al</em>. 2018). Using chainsaws and rakes to remove all pine needle debris, six areas were cleared providing <em>ca</em> one km<sup>2</sup> of new nesting habitat for iguanas. Ten iguana nests with hatched eggshells were observed in these restored plots from the 2017 nesting season. Additional pine removals and monitoring to ensure against regrowth are planned.<br/><br/>Additional training of law enforcement personnel is needed to ensure protection of the Mona Rhinoceros Iguana. Some education and outreach materials targeting visitors are in place on the island but needs improvement. A focus in the schools on differentiating native iguanas with invasive Common Green Iguanas, and their roles in the ecosystem, would also benefit this species.",Neotropical,,false,false,Global
2791124,19243030,Brachylophus fasciatus,Endangered,A2abce+4abce,2012,2012-06-21 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"Lau Banded Iguanas have experienced significant declines of well over 50% in the last few decades and is currently not secure on any island where it occurs. During recent surveys of more than 50 islands where they should have been present, iguanas were detected on approximately 20% and several local extirpations were confirmed. On all but three islands, occurrence was extremely rare. There is a continuing loss and degradation of remaining habitat from deforestation, expansion of human development, and cat predation. Without conservation intervention, the degradation observed during the last 20 years is predicted to cause further declines over the next 20 years that approaches 80% and potentially will be found to be even higher with further population analysis.<br/><br/>The concept of this taxon has changed from what was previously assessed on the IUCN Red List. The previous concept of <em>B. fasciatus</em> has now been split into three separate species, hence the historic listings of <em>B. fasciatus sensu lato</em> are no longer included here.","<p>The Lau Banded Iguana occurs in a range of habitat types on differing island formations.&#160; In the north, islands are volcanic in origin and contain wet forest, whereas in the south the islands are raised limestone and contain dry forest, often with very little open soil. The lack of soil and dry nature of the limestone islands potentially restricts where nesting can occur, but since Harlow (2003) reported finding many eggshells on Aiwa during their surveys, it may not be a limiting factor for iguana reproduction.</p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p>Iguanas are primarily found in remnant stands of native forests on the islands they occupy, but are sometimes found in marginal habitats of non-native plants, native hibiscus, and degraded forest around villages and also along ocean margins, but always where trees are at least six metres in height. The highest densities of this iguana were found on Aiwa and Vuaqava, both of which are lacking understory due to overgrazing by goats. As was seen on Yadua Taba for Fiji Crested Iguanas (<em>Brachylophus vitiensis)</em>, the removal of goats has a big impact on restoration of dry forest habitat and can allow the iguana population to expand greatly.</p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p>As with most iguanas, this species is herbivorous, although a comprehensive study of its diet in the wild has never been studied as it is so rare. They are assumed to prefer the same food plants as the better studied <em>Brachylophus vitiensis</em>, as many or most of these same plants occur on the islands occupied by <em>B. fasciatus</em>. All the <em>Brachylophus</em> iguanas are very difficult to observe during the day and occupy the highest levels of the tree canopy on the islands.</p>  <p>&#160;</p>  A combination of data for the genus and specific to <em>B.</em> <em>fasciatus</em> indicate that wild Lau Banded Iguanas are not reproductive until age four and the mean generation length is likely to be 10-15 years. They lay an average of five eggs per clutch. This lizard is the smallest South Pacific iguana species with a maximum snout-to-vent length of 18 cm. This species is differentiated from the other two <em>Brachylophus</em> iguanas both genetically and by several morphological characters including body size, the diminutive size and higher number of dorsal crest spines, the low number of femoral pores, nostril colour and shape, and overall colour pattern.","<p>Black Rats (<em>Rattus rattus</em>) and feral cats (<em>Felis catus</em>) are the main mammalian predators threatening the persistence of iguanas and are capable of causing local extinctions in a relatively short time period. Fortunately, mongoose has not been introduced to the Lau Group yet, and maintaining it free of them is an important biosecurity issue. On a few islands, free-roaming domestic&#160;<a style=""mso-comment-reference:TG_1;mso-comment-date:20120623T1638"">pigs (<em>Sus scrofa</em>)&#160;</a>were observed to cause major disturbance in small forest patches, turning large areas to bare mud that is no longer suitable for iguana nesting. Free-ranging domestic goats (<em>Capra aegagrus</em>) are an important concern on many of the smaller islands as they also browse the plants most important to iguanas, and effectively remove these plants from the habitat. Also, intentionally-set fires are used to round up the goats, further enhancing the transition to grassland and inhibiting native forest regeneration.</p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p>Even in the absence of goat herding, forest burning is widespread and is increasingly one of the biggest threats to iguana habitat and their persistence. Continued deforestation on the small islands where Lau Banded Iguanas remain is predicted to cause additional local extinctions over the next 40 years. In particular, on the large islands of Lakeba and Vanua Balavu where iguanas should have been numerous, there has been significant forest loss through deforestation, burning, and fragmentation (R. Fisher pers. obs. and Google Earth).</p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p>Additional threats to the native forests include further development of urban and village areas, plantation agriculture, and logging. In particular, harvesting Vesi Tree (<em>Intsia bijuga</em>) for use in traditional carving on several islands (for example, Kabara) has significantly reduced the native forest. Forest conversion to Caribbean Pine plantations is also significant, especially on Lakeba. Proposed development of tourism resorts, on the smaller islands in particular, has significant impacts on these habitats, possibly leading to losses of entire iguana populations as has been observed elsewhere in Fiji. Finally, proposed new cruise ship routes to the remote Lau islands will require construction of new infrastructure and is likely to be a source of invasive species from Viti Levu unless strict biosecurity measures are enforced.</p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p>The impact of the recent introduction and spread of the invasive alien Common Green Iguana (<em>Iguana iguana</em>) in Fiji are not yet known for this species but have been shown to have significant detrimental effects everywhere they have been introduced (Thomas <em>et al</em>. 2011). Eradication for this invasive now appears unlikely, and it is possible the Green Iguana will continue to spread to other well-forested islands despite eradication efforts. Green Iguanas are vastly more fecund and aggressive than native iguanas and may have significant effects on remnant small island populations. At minimum, this introduction has caused considerable confusion in the local education programmes aimed at protection of Banded Iguanas versus eradication of the Green Iguanas, since juveniles of the latter appear superficially similar.&#160; The northern Lau Islands are very close to Qamea where the Green Iguana was first introduced and are at high risk of invasion.</p>  <p>&#160;</p>  Irruptions of invasive alien Yellow Crazy Ants (<em>Anoplolepis gracilipes</em>) are known to occur on many of the southern Lau islands. Even though these ants were introduced to Fiji over 100 years ago, it is not understood what causes populations to periodically irrupt in huge numbers on some islands. When Crazy Ants irrupt, the entire ground surface, shrubs, and trees are entirely covered with ants and it has been observed that native skink and gecko abundance drops greatly during this time (R. Fisher unpublished data). The impact of aggressive ant irruptions on iguana reproduction and recruitment is not known, but is likely to suffer similarly to other lizards (Holway <em>et al</em>. 2002).<br/>        <br/><br/>                  Lau Banded Iguanas are sometimes locally kept as pets, and this was observed on three different islands during surveys in 2011. Historically, these iguanas would have been a local food source, similar to the larger extinct species (<em>Lapitaiguana</em> and <em>B. gibbonsi</em>) in the region, but there are no recent records of human consumption. The black market trade in <em>Brachylophus</em> does not include this species and is unlikely to be a threat in the future as its remaining localities are very remote.","<p>                 </p><p>Among all the islands surveyed for the presence of Lau Banded Iguana, only on the two Aiwa Islands were enough lizards found to estimate a population size, this was estimated to number less than 8,000 total (Harlow 2003). More recent surveys in July 2011 also determined that, where present, iguanas were very few in number except on the uninhabited 8.1 km²<sup></sup> island of Vuaqava (R. Fisher unpublished data 2011). Although there is no historic population size data available, the Lau Banded Iguana is believed to have declined by at least 50% in the last 30-45 years based on their fossil distribution, an estimated abundance based on the size of their range islands, the area of former forest and known iguana abundance in intact forests, and the known impacts of humans and their associated goats, cats, and rats. Discussions with island residents indicate that on most islands the iguanas are now more rare than they had been in the recent past. Most islands in the region are now inhabited and iguanas were generally found in degraded forests or remnant forest patches, but not in proximity to villages or gardens. Surprisingly, among the uninhabited islands surveyed only one was found to have iguanas present, but this is likely due to the abundance of cats present on the iguana-free islands. It is known that local residents intentionally translocate kittens to these uninhabited islands for rat control.</p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p>The two largest islands in the Lau Group would have once supported very large numbers of Lau Banded Iguanas. Lakeba is the largest (55.9 km²) although the majority of the island has now been deforested and planted with Caribbean Pine (<em>Pinus caribea</em>) which is unsuitable for iguanas. According to Franklin <em>et al</em>. (2008), Lakeba has less than 9% of native forest remaining. At least one small subpopulation of iguana might remain, as one captive individual was seen in a village in 2011 that had been captured from one of the remaining forest patches. This is the first time an iguana was documented on Lakeba since the 1940s. The inhabited island of Vanua Balavu is the next largest island (53.2 km²) and has also experienced severe deforestation, although it was one of only two islands where <em>B. fasciatus</em> was detected during surveys of Northern Lau in 2007 (M. Tuiwawa pers. comm.). All other islands in the Lau Group are much smaller and vary in the amount of forest remaining, from those that completely lack native forests to uninhabited islands such as Aiwa and Vuaqava where native forests are largely intact.</p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p>The Lau Banded Iguana was not found in recent surveys on the inhabited Yasayasa Islands of Moala, Totoya, and Matuku (R. Fisher pers. comm. 2011) where they were reported to occur by Gibbons and Watkins (1982). Interviews with local residents indicate iguanas are likely to have been extirpated from these islands. Field surveys in July 2011 of the southern Lau Group and Yasayasa Islands included 25 islands, and night surveys were conducted on 15. Lau Banded Iguanas were confirmed on only six of these islands; in some cases only a few individuals were detected. Historically, iguanas were probably abundant throughout most of these islands. In 2007, islands in the northern Lau Group were surveyed and iguanas were found on only two of the 15 islands visited (M. Tuiwawa, pers. comm.). Although night surveys were not conducted on every island, presence or absence of iguanas was confirmed by interviews with residents during these visits that are highly knowledgeable of local fauna and flora. In 2008, 12 islands in the central Lau Group were surveyed and iguanas were found only on the two Aiwa Islands as was previously known (M. Tuiwawa pers. comm., Harlow 2003). An additional uninhabited island (16.2 hectare Olorua, Kabara) was reported to have iguanas by the residents of Komo, but unfortunately this island was inaccessible during the survey. Iguanas were not detected on Lakeba in 2008 and it is believed they are extremely rare.</p>  <p>&#160;</p>  In summary, a total of 52 islands in the Lau Group and Yasayasa Islands were visited between 2007 and 2011 and iguanas were detected or reported from only 11 islands, with an additional report from one island that was not visited. Iguanas were abundant on only three islands, the two neighbouring Aiwa Islands and Vuaqava, all of which are uninhabited. Goats have recently populated all three of these islands and Vuaqava has a seemingly large cat population. Most of these 53 islands should have had resident iguana populations. For example, two islands with historic populations, Moce and Oneata, were described by the Whitney Expedition (Burt and Burt 1932) and have since been extirpated. Given these results, it appears that iguanas could be remaining on about 20% of the islands in the region and are abundant on only 5%.&#160;    <p></p>",Decreasing,"<p>The Lau Banded Iguana is native only to the islands in the Lau Group of eastern Fiji and it was introduced to Tonga. Because there is widespread sub-fossil evidence of <em>B. fasciatu</em>s from the Lau Group but these fossils are absent from Tonga, it is believed that Lau Banded Iguanas were introduced from the Lau Group to Tonga in historic times, possibly as an alternative food source after <em>Brachylophus gibbonsi</em> was hunted to extinction soon after human colonization of the area, approximately 2,800 years ago (Pregill and Dye 1989, Pregill and Steadman 2004). Molecular data also supports this theory of introduction since the Tongan iguanas are nearly genetically identical to those from the Lau Group, while subpopulations of other <em>Brachylophus</em> species show sizeable genetic differentiation among them (Keogh <em>et al.</em> 2008).</p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p>Within the Lau Group, the iguana has been confirmed recently from only 11 islands ranging from Vanua Balavu in the north to Fulaga and Ogea in the south (R. Fisher pers. comm. 2011). Previously, iguanas had been known from Moce and Oneata, for example, and probably occurred on most islands throughout the Lau Group. The iguanas from Yacata and Vatu Vara, to the west of Vanua Balavu, were not designated as <em>B. fasciatus</em> by Keogh <em>et al</em>. (2008) due to lack of genetic samples and some morphological discrepancies observed in specimens collected in the 1920s. Preliminary analysis of iguanas from Taveuni and Qamea Islands to the north of Vanua Balavu indicate that these are most similar to <em>B. fasciatus</em>, but genetically different from all of the other animals sampled from the Lau Group (R. Fisher pers. comm. 2011).</p>  <p>&#160;</p>  Iguanas are probably found up to 200 metres above sea level, although most islands they occur on are lower than 100 metres.","Lau Banded Iguanas are sometimes locally kept as pets, and this was observed on three different islands during surveys in 2011. Historically, these iguanas would have been a local food source, similar to the larger extinct species (<em>Lapitaiguana</em> and <em>B. gibbonsi</em>) in the region, but there are no recent records of human consumption.

The smaller <a style=""mso-comment-reference:TG_1;mso-comment-date:20120624T0903"">islands</a><span class=""MsoCommentReference"">&#160;with recently confirmed iguana populations need to be resurveyed quantitatively to develop population estimates and map the remaining habitat on each island. Island assessments for feral cats and Black Rats in the region are needed also, as these appear to be the most important predator for <em>Brachylophus</em> iguanas. Further research on the role of invasive ants in possible iguana declines is also needed.</p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p>Genetic confirmation is needed for iguanas that were recently sampled and appear to be <em>B.</em> <em>fasciatus</em>, particularly from the newly surveyed areas of southern Lau and Vanua Balavu. The iguanas of Yacata and Vatu Vara, which were identified in Keogh <em>et al</em>. (2008) as possibly belonging to this species, need to be assessed systematically, as do the other islands in the northern Lau Group lacking recent survey information.</p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p>Education programmes for the local community need to continue to stress the importance of the role of iguanas in the ecosystem, its value for protection, and the differences between native and invasive Green Iguanas. Within the conservation community, education and awareness are needed to better inform people about the differences between this species and the recently separated Fiji Banded Iguana, <em>Brachylophus bulabula</em>, as much of the literature regarding banded iguanas in Fiji still refers to <em>B. fasciatus</em> in name, regardless of which species the information actually pertains to.</p>  <p>&#160;</p>  A Conservation Action Plan is badly needed for this species as no specific conservation actions have been designed or implemented to ensure its survival. The confusion with <em>Brachylophus bulabula</em>, and the assumption that they occur on many islands, significantly under-represents the threats to this species. Based on the rate of habitat degradation over the last 20 years, the number of Lau Banded Iguanas and the persistence of their remaining subpopulations will have declined by at least 70% by the end of the next 20 years without intervention.

2952954,41305,Lepus corsicanus,Vulnerable,A2bcde,2019,2018-06-01 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"This assessment is based on field surveys (spotlight censuses, hunting  bag, captures, etc.) and on molecular analyses of specimens collected by  a network of helpers (hunters, park rangers, etc.). This species has  been monitored since 1997 in continental Italy and Sicily. The Corsican  Hare shows a variable conservation status across its distribution range.  Due to the fragmentation and scarcity of Corsican Hare populations in  continental Italy, its mainland status is classified as nationally  endangered (following Angelici and Luiselli 2001). However, the creation  of several protected areas in southern and central Italy should help  the populations to recover. In Sicily, the Corsican Hare is widespread  and the populations are locally abundant, although in this restricted  area. Furthermore, since its official recognition as true species  (1998), the local government has forbidden hare hunting on the island.  However, hunting of this species was permitted during the 2004-2005  hunting season in Sicily. Therefore, in Sicily the Corsican Hare does  not appear to be threatened.<br/><br/>The species was introduced to  Corsica, probably in the first half of the 14th century, then the  species was wrongly deemed extinct in Corsica in 1984 (Dubray and Roux  1984) and then rediscovered on the island by Scalera and Angelici  (2002). The populations are increasing in the northern region of the  island, but are found in a more precarious status in the south (Pietri  2015).<br/><br/>Globally, this species is classified as Vulnerable due to  its variable conservation status across its geographic range. Utilizing  information currently available regarding the historical range on  continental Italy, we replicated this portion of the range using GIS to  calculate the total area (Pierpaoli <em>et al.</em> 1999). The result  showed that the historical range on continental Italy was approximately  79,700 km². Online sources gave an area of approximately 25,700 km² for  Sicily. This provides a total area of 105,400 km² as the historical  range for the Corsican Hare. We infer an approximate decline of 91% for  the actual continental occupancy areas of populations in 2015 from the  map provided in Pierpaoli (1999). From this we derived an overall  decrease in occupied area of 69.2% for the species as a whole. Over the  past decade Corsican Hares have declined 50% for continental  populations, and thus an estimated 38% for the species as a whole  (Schai-Braun and Hackländer 2018). These declines have resulted from a  variety of causes. Although the species is protected from hunting in  continental Italy and Sicily, it remains difficult to distinguish the  species from the European Hare and there may be significant collateral  deaths due to hunting and illegal poaching. Additionally, increasing  habitat degradation and predation by foxes and feral dogs negatively  impact Corsican Hare populations. The species has undergone significant  fragmentation of populations which reduces gene flow and may lead to  inbreeding depression. Corsican Hares are susceptible to EHBS and RHDV2  viruses (Camarda <em>et al.</em> 2014), which can lead to severe local declines in numbers. The species is confirmed as Vulnerable under criterion A2bcde.","Information about the ecology of this species is still limited. However,  it seems well adapted to the Mediterranean environment, although it has  been recorded from sea level to 2,400 m asl on Mount Etna (Sicily).  The preferred habitats are the Mediterranean maquis and the mosaic of  clearings (also cultivated), bushy areas, and broad-leaved woods.  Furthermore the Corsican Hare inhabits also coastal dune habitat. When  it is in sympatry with the European Hare, the latter species tends to be  more a habitat generalist, while the Corsican Hare seems to inhabit  almost only pastures and grasslands. In Sicily, the species inhabits a  variety of natural and artificial habitats: open grassland, bushy  pastures, cultivated areas, etc.<br/><br/>In terms of elevation, the  European Hare and Corsican Hare do not differ significantly when they  live allopatrically. According to Angelici and Luiselli (2001), when the  two species coexist in sympatry, the Corsican Hare occurs at elevations  significantly higher than the European Hare. The Corsican Hare inhabits  significantly higher elevations when it lives allopatrically than when  it lives sympatrically, and the Corsican Hare inhabits significantly  higher elevations when it lives sympatrically than when it lives  allopatrically. However, this ecological allocation is not shared by  Trocchi and Riga (2005) who always directly observed, in sympatric  condition, the European Hare occupying the mountain grassland and the  Corsican Hare inhabiting the lower and warmer areas with thermophilous  oak woods.<br/><br/>The diet of the Corsican Hare, studied in Sicily,  varies seasonally as the available vegetation changes. Monocotyledones,  Cyperaceae and Juncaceae, are ingested year round, while Gramineae and  Labiatae are consumed during spring and summer, respectively (De  Battisti <em>et al.</em> 2004). Dicotyledones ingested year round by the Corsican Hare are Leguminosae and Compositae (De Battisti <em>et al.</em>  2004). In southern Italy the Corsican Hare is known to consume over 70  different species of plants, primarily grasses and herbs (Freschi <em>et al.</em> 2014, 2015, 2016).<br/><br/>The Corsican Hare may serve as a prey item for native carnivores and endangered raptors.","The main threats to the Corsican Hare have been identified in the following aspects: fragmentation of the range, low or absent genetic flow between populations, low population density, habitat loss, introduction of the European Hare in central and southern Italy (with interspecific competition); competition with European Rabbits (<em>Oryctolagus cuniculus</em>) - mainly in Sicily (where this species is widely distributed), disease spread – the Corsican Hare is fully susceptible to EBHS and RHDV2 (see Camarda <em>et al.</em> 2014), over-hunting, poaching, and predation by foxes and feral dogs (both abundant and largely distributed in southern Italy). The Corsican Hare is susceptible to accidental mortality due to difficulties distinguishing it from the European Hare by hunters (Angelici and Luiselli 2001). Potential hybridization between the European Hare and Corsican Hare could constitute a future threat to the species in continental Italy (Pierpaoli <em>et al.</em> 2003, Mengoni <em>et al. </em>2014); however hybridization with the Iberian Hare and the European Hare has been assessed in Corsica (Pietri <em>et al.</em> 2011). On the major threat list ""other"" has been checked and identified as intraspecific genetic pollution.","Populations of the Corsican Hare in the Italian peninsula have a fragmented distribution and are sometimes in sympatry and syntopy with the European Hare. Density estimates highlight low values in hunting areas (0.5 hares/km²) and higher in protected areas (11 hares/km²). In mainland Italy the Corsican Hare is decreasing because of habitat degradation, hunting pressure, and probably from competition with introduced European Hares. However, in Sicily, where there are not populations of the European Hare, the Corsican Hare is continuously distributed and locally abundant (protected areas: 10 hares/km²; hunting areas: 2 hares/km²). In Corsica’s main range, namely Haute-Corse, the species appears to demonstrate a population increase. In the other two parts of the island (Cap Corse and Sagone) the status of the species has proven to be much more precarious, the small population size or the hybridization with the Iberian Hare and European Hare being major threats to the species (Pietri 2015).",Decreasing,"Until the 1930s, the Corsican Hare was distributed in south-central  Italy (the northern limit being marked by Elba Island on the Tyrrhenian  coast and the province of Foggia on the Adriatic coast) and Sicily. It  was also present in Corsica, where it was introduced by man in  historical times (maybe between the 14th and 17th centuries). The  current distribution of the Corsican Hare is still poorly known. In  Sicily, the distribution seems to be continuous, whereas in the Italian  Peninsula, populations are known only in Tuscany (in Grosseto province),  Latium, Abruzzo, Molise, Apulia (Gargano), Campania, Basilicata and  Calabria. It has been recorded from sea level to 2,400 m a.s.l. on Mount  Etna. Recently the presence of the Corsican Hare has been rediscovered  in Corsica, too (Scalera and Angelici 2002). The distribution of Italian  Hare covers three distinct parts on the island, for a total surface  area of close to 2,900 km², 97% of which is situated in a single region,  namely Haute-Corse, the other two areas are Cap Corse and Sagone.  Habitat suitability models for central Italy suggest high suitability of  the internal mountain ranges as well as the Mediterranian maquis along  the coast (Angelici <em><em><em><em><em>et al.</em></em></em></em></em> 2011).","Today the Corsican Hare is legally protected in continental Italy because of the poor conservation status of its populations. However, the problematic discrimination in the field between the Corsican Hare and the European Hare (a game species) produces remarkable problems for effective protection. Since the Corsican Hare was recognized as a true species (1998), hare hunting has been banned in Sicily. During the 2004-2005 hunting season, this ban was lifted allowing the hunting of all hares in Sicily. In Corsica it is a game species, since it is not distinguished from the European Hare in the French hunting act.",Terrestrial,"<p>The Corsican Hare is legally protected in continental Italy because of its poor conservation status (primarily low population size).

Research indicates that an invariably fatal infectious cancer, Devil Facial Tumour Disease (DFTD), is responsible for the decline. DFTD currently occurs across the majority (estimated 60%) of the geographic range of the devil and continues to spread at variable rates (depending on location) in the range of 7-50 km/y (McCallum <em>et al</em>. 2007). Mark-recapture data from the most intensively studied population at Freycinet National Park estimated a decline in total population size of 30% in the first 3 years after disease arrival, with an annual decline in the adult (2+) population of 50% (Lachish <em>et al</em>. 2007). Both projections from these observed results and an epidemiological model predict local extinction at this site within 10 years of disease arrival (McCallum <em>et al</em>. 2007). At a second site, Mt William, where DFTD signs were first reported 10 years ago, mark-recapture methods estimate a decline of 90% over 10 years. There is no evidence either of a reduction in disease prevalence or of the rate of population decline as devil abundance reduces. On current information, we therefore project at least 90% population decline over the next 10 years across the 60% of the devil's distribution currently occupied by disease, with at least a 100 km extension of the disease distribution. Together, this would amount to a further decline (in excess of the 50% already observed) of at least 70% in the next 10 years, with widespread local extinctions. Whilst the cause of decline (DFTD) is understood, it has not ceased and its effects are not reversible with current knowledge.","Tasmanian Devils are found throughout Tasmania, in all native terrestrial habitats, as well as in forestry plantations and pasture, from sea level to all but the highest peaks of Tasmania (Jones and Rose 1996, Jones and Barmuta 2000). Densities are lowest in the buttongrass plains of the south-west and, prior to Devil Facial Tumour Disease (DFTD) emergence, highest in the dry and mixed sclerophyll forests and coastal heath of Tasmania's eastern half and north-west coast (Jones and Rose 1996). Open forests and woodlands are preferred, while tall or dense wet forests are avoided (Jones and Rose 1996; Jones and Barmuta 2000). The highest population densities are found in mixed patches of grazing land and forest or woodland. Relative trapping success and spool-and-line tracking indicate that Tasmanian Devils travel through lowlands, saddles and along creeks, avoiding steep slopes and rocky areas, and favouring predictably rich sources of food such as bush/pasture mosaics on farms, carcass and rubbish dumps, and roads (Jones and Barmuta 2000, Pukk 2005; N. Mooney and D. Pemberton pers. comm.).  Tasmanian Devils are able to reach very high densities, even in suboptimal habitat, if sufficient food and den sites are available. The 14 km² Badger Island at one time supported 120 Tasmanian Devils.<br/><br/>Seabird colonies, such as Short-tailed Shearwaters (or muttonbirds, <em>Puffinus tenuirostris</em>), are thought to have traditionally been a preferred habitat for Tasmanian Devils, providing an important food source. These are now much reduced along the east coast, but some sites remain along the west coast (D. Pemberton pers. comm.).<br/><br/>Dens are typically underground burrows (such as old wombat burrows), dense riparian vegetation, thick grass tussocks and caves. Adults are thought to remain faithful to their dens for life so den disturbance is destabilizing to populations (Owen and Pemberton 2005). In settled areas, dens are often under buildings which may be occupied by people.<br/><br/>Tasmanian Devils are the sole host to the only threatened invertebrate parasite, a tapeworm, <em>Dasyurotaenia robusta</em>, which is currently listed as Rare under the Tasmanian Threatened Species Protection Act 1995. <br/><br/><strong>Feeding</strong><br/>Tasmanian Devils are considered to be generalist predators and specialized scavengers; prey comprise primarily medium- to large-sized mammals, although they will eat large invertebrates such as bogong moths (<em>Agrotis infusa</em>) and the carcasses of any dead vertebrates, leading them to focus on areas where lambing, calving or wallaby shooting are in progress (Guiler 1970a, Jones and Barmuta 2000, Jones 2003, Owen and Pemberton 2005). Tasmanian Devils solitarily and actively hunt prey up to about 20 kg in size (including Bennett's Wallabies, <em>Macropus rufogriseus rufogriseus</em>, and Common Wombats, <em>Vombattus ursinus</em>) using a combination of ambush and short, moderate-speed pursuits (Jones 1998, 2003; Owen and Pemberton 2005).<br/><br/><strong>Movement patterns</strong><br/>Devils are usually nocturnal. There are no data to suggest seasonal changes in pattern of movement, apart from reduced activity of females with young in their dens (Pemberton 1990), although longer range movements (see below) are observed more frequently in winter. Tasmanian Devils occupy several different dens, changing dens every 1-3 days, and travelling a mean nightly distance of 8.6 km (Pemberton 1990). However, individuals have occasionally been observed to move up to 50 km in a single night (M. Jones pers. comm.). <br/><br/>Home ranges are found to overlap considerably. A typical home range across a two to four week period is estimated to be 13 km², ranging from 4-27 km² (Pemberton 1990). Different breeding females may be caught outside the same den site (Badger Island, N. Mooney unpubl.).<br/><br/><strong>Life-cycle</strong><br/>The Tasmanian Devil is promiscuous and breeds once a year during February to June (Hesterman <em>et al.</em> 2008; M. Jones pers. comm., Save the Tasmanian Devil Program unpubl.). In earlier studies the mating season was found to occur over a much shorter period, primarily during February-March (Guiler 1970b; D. Pemberton pers. comm.). <br/><br/>The majority of individuals mature at two years old; in DFTD-free areas, 5-10% of females typically mature at one year (Guiler 1970b; Hughes 1982; Pemberton 1990; Jones <em>et al</em>. in review; Hesterman <em>et al.</em>, in prep.). <br/><br/>Reproductive success is high in wild, non-diseased populations, with nearly all females of breeding age (2-4) bringing the full complement (n = 4) of pouched young through to weaning (Pemberton 1990; H. Hesterman unpubl.). Success to maturity of post-weaning individuals is unknown. <br/><br/>Tasmanian Devils are thought to breed and raise their young in traditional dens (Owen and Pemberton 2005), but new sites (e.g. under buildings) are also used. <br/><br/>Longevity in the wild is 5-6 years (Guiler 1978; Jones 2001; Jones <em>et al</em>. in press). The sum effect of mortality and emigration at Mount William (pre-disease) was estimated as 80% between the first and second year, followed by 20% in subsequent years (Pemberton 1990). <br/><br/>Increased contact between individuals in breeding season results in higher injury rates as a result of intra/inter-sexual aggression. DFTD is thought most likely to be most easily transmitted between Tasmanian Devils through biting (AUSVET 2005; Pearse and Swift 2006; Hamede 2007), therefore this is a time of higher potential for disease spread.","The major threat to this species at present is Devil Facial Tumour Disease (DFTD), compounded by roadkills, dog kills and persecution.<br/><br/><strong>Devil Facial Tumour Disease (DFTD)</strong><br/>Current evidence suggests that DFTD is an infectious, widespread disease (McCallum <em>et al.</em> 2007), so that any attempt to delineate boundaries between affected and unaffected locations is likely to be outdated swiftly. DFTD has been associated with local population declines of up to 89% since first reported (Hawkins <em>et al</em>. 2006, McCallum <em>et al</em>. 2007), indicated by long-term spotlighting data, widespread trapping and laboratory results. The declines, and the prevalence of the disease, have not eased off in any monitoring sites, and DFTD is present even in very low density areas. It is estimated that the adult population is approximately halving annually on the Freycinet peninsula (Lachish <em>et al</em>. 2007) with extinction predicted at this site 10-15 years after disease arrival (McCallum <em>et al</em>. 2007). Declines were most marked in areas where the disease had been reported earliest, in north-eastern and central eastern Tasmania.<br/><br/>Mean spotlighting sightings of Tasmanian Devils per 10 km route, obtained from across the core Tasmanian Devil range (eastern and north-western Tasmania), have declined by 53% since the first report of DFTD-like symptoms in 1996 (McCallum <em>et al</em>. 2007). The most immediately threatened location is thought to be the region where DFTD was reported prior to 2003: across 15,000 km² of eastern Tasmania. By 2005, the Devil Disease Project Team had confirmed DFTD in individuals found across 36,000 km² of eastern and central Tasmania (Hawkins <em>et al</em>. 2006). DFTD is now confirmed across more than 60% of the devil's overall distribution (C. Hawkins unpubl.), and there is evidence for continued geographical spread of the disease (Hawkins <em>et al</em>. 2006), so that Tasmanian Devils across between 51% and 100% of Tasmania may be, or have already been, subject to &gt;90% declines in a ten-year period. The currently affected region covers the majority of the formerly high-density eastern management unit, involving what was perhaps around 80% of the total population.<br/><br/>DTFD has resulted in the progressive loss of first the older adults from the population and then the younger adults (Lachish <em>et al</em>. 2007) so that populations are comprised of one and two year olds (Jones <em>et al</em>. in press, Lachish <em>et al</em>. submitted). As female devils usually breed for the first time at age two, they may not successfully raise a litter before they die of DFTD (Lachish <em>et al</em>. submitted). An increase in precocial breeding indicates some compensatory response, but as yet this appears to have been insufficient to counter mortality (Jones <em>et al</em>. in press, Lachish <em>et al</em>. submitted).<br/><br/>DFTD behaves like a frequency-dependent disease, probably because the majority of the injurious biting, which is the type of contact most likely to lead to disease transmission, occurs between adults during the mating season (Hamede <em>et al</em>. in press). Frequency-dependent diseases, which are typically sexually transmitted, can lead to extinction (McCallum and Jones 2006). Because transmission occurs between the sexes at mating irrespective of population density, these types of diseases lack a threshold density below which they become extinct.<br/><br/>Cannibalism is considered fairly common in Tasmanian Devils and renders the species particularly vulnerable to disease transmission (Pfennig <em>et al</em>. 1998; Jones <em>et al</em>. 2007). However, modes of transmission of DFTD are not as yet known.<br/><br/><strong>Road-kills</strong><br/>A recent three-year study of roadkill frequency on the main roads of Tasmania estimated 2,205 Tasmanian Devils are killed on roads annually (Hobday and Minstrell submitted). This suggests that 2-3.% of the total Tasmanian Devil population are killed on roads (based on an estimated population of 60,000–90,000 individuals at the time of the survey). The roaded parts of Tasmania closely match the core distribution area for Tasmanian Devils.<br/><br/>Roadkill was attributed as the cause of up to 50% and 20% of Tasmanian Devil death during a recording period of 17 months at Cradle Mountain and 12 months at Freycinet National Parks, respectively (Jones 2000; M. Jones pers. comm.). Local extinction and a similar rate of population decline at Cradle Mountain indicates that roadkill can cause local extinction, in which the road becomes a local sink (Jones 2000). Future impact is likely to remain at the same level.<br/><br/><strong>Dog kills</strong><br/>Reports of about 50 devils killed per year by poorly controlled dogs are served from about 20 dog owners. There is no obligation or incentive for such reports, and generally some hesitance even among those providing them, so the real figures are more likely of the order of several hundred devils killed by dogs each year.<br/><br/><strong>Foxes</strong><br/>There have been spasmodic, small-scale introductions of the Red Fox (<em>Vulpes vulpes</em>) into Tasmania since early European colonisation. Early incursions were sometimes efforts at acclimatisation and others for short-term hunting. More recently, there has been at least one accidental incursion (from a container ship in 1998) and credible reports of a concerted, malicious campaign of introduction. Hard evidence (confirmed scats, carcasses) of foxes has been found in the north-west and northern and southern midlands. Credible sighting reports have come from most of the eastern half of the State including the central highlands and the far north-west (Fox Free Tasmania 2006), mostly areas where Tasmanian Devil populations are suppressed by DFTD.<br/><br/>A commonly held view has been that the abundance of Tasmanian Devils has prevented fox establishment through interference competition, either aggressive exclusion or predation on denned juveniles (Jones <em>et al</em>. 2007). Red Foxes and Tasmanian Devils share preferences for den sites and habitat, and are of a similar size. Tasmanian Devils abundance is likely to slow, if not prevent, fox establishment. It is possible that foxes have been present in Tasmania for many decades at sub-detectable levels, and that a degree of ecological release has occurred due to DFTD, with foxes increasing to detectable numbers. The current impact of the Red Fox has been quantified (N. Mooney pers. comm.), and it is unlikely that fox numbers are currently at a level to impose a measurable impact.<br/><br/>A decline in Tasmanian Devils number may create a short to medium-term surplus of food, for example carrion; ideal for fox establishment. Fox establishment may cause both direct and indirect effects on Tasmanian Devils. Direct effects include (reciprocal) killing by then abundant foxes of then rare juvenile devils at dens while the female forages (Jones <em>et al</em>. 2007). Fox establishment may also cause ecosystem disruptions through changes in other species (Jones <em>et al</em>. 2007) - a feature of foxes on mainland Australia (e.g. Saunders <em>et al</em>. 1995) and something that might then also indirectly affect Tasmanian Devils. Tasmania has the potential to hold up to 250,000 foxes (based on modelling of habitat preferences and densities in south-east mainland Australian) which could replace most medium- to large-sized marsupial carnivores (N. Mooney unpubl.).<br/><br/><strong>Persecution</strong><br/>In the past, persecution of the Tasmanian Devil has been very high throughout settled parts of Tasmania, and is thought to have brought about very low numbers at times. Through the 1980s and 1990s, systematic poisoning in many sheep-growing areas (particularly fine-wool with its reliance on merinos) was widespread and probably killed in excess of 5000 devils per year (N. Mooney unpubl., from interviews with landowners). In the 1990s, control permits were occasionally issued to individuals who were able to argue that Tasmanian Devils were pests (e.g. killing valuable lambs).<br/><br/>Current persecution is much reduced, but can still be locally intense with in excess of 500 devils thought to be killed per year (N. Mooney pers. comm.). However, this is reducing since devil numbers have declined. While the small amount of current persecution is likely to persist it is unlikely to constitute a major threat unless the Tasmanian Devil population becomes extremely small and fragmented.<br/><br/><strong>Low genetic diversity</strong><br/>Jones <em>et al</em>. (2004) found the genetic diversity of Tasmanian Devils to be low relative to many Australian marsupials as well as placental carnivores. This was consistent with an island founder effect, but previous marked reductions in population size may also have played a role. Low genetic diversity can reduce population viability (Eldridge <em>et al</em>. 1999) and resistance to disease (Acevedo-Whitehouse <em>et al</em>. 2005).","In the early to mid-1990s, the total population estimate was 130,000–150,000 individuals (M. Jones pers. comm.; N. Mooney pers. comm.; DPIW unpubl.), based on extrapolations of population density estimates according to habitat. Systematic statewide spotlighting surveys have been carried out since 1985. Spotlighting sightings of Tasmanian Devils across the state have declined significantly since emergence of Devil Facial Tumour Disease (DFTD) in the mid-1990s: by 27% by early 2004, by 41% by early 2006, by 53% by early 2007 (Hawkins <em>et al.</em> 2006; McCallum <em>et al.</em> 2007), and by 64% by early 2008 (C. Hawkins <em>et al</em>. unpubl.). The decline was significantly sharper in regions where DFTD had been reported earliest, such that in north-east Tasmania, mean sightings have declined by 95% from 1992-1995 to 2005-2007, with no indication of recovery or plateau in decline. Comparison of mark-recapture results in the same area from the mid-1980s and 2007 supports this finding (McCallum <em>et al</em>. 2007). At the Freycinet peninsula, on the east coast of Tasmania, where the population has been monitored through trapping from 1999 to the present, the population has declined by at least 60% since the disease was first detected in 2001 and the adult population still appears to be halving annually (Lachish <em>et al</em>. 2007). Other indicators of devil abundance, such as roadkills, predation on stock, and carrion removal, also support this conclusion of a substantial decline.<br/><br/>If a 64% decline based on spotlighting surveys is applied to the population estimates from the mid-1990s, the 2007 population size would have been an estimated 25,000 mature individuals (50,000 individuals total). Another method generated an estimated total population size in 2004 of approximately 21,000 mature individuals (C. Hawkins, unpubl.). This estimate was derived from mark-recapture density estimates from ten sites (four disease-free sites, six diseased sites) in the highest density areas (north-east and south-east Tasmania) and from one disease free site outside the high density area. The population estimate at each trapping site incorporated 95% confidence intervals of +/-c. 25%. A standard buffer was placed around each trap site to calculate the area from which Tasmanian Devils are trapped during a survey, and this area varies between sites, affecting density calculations. If this estimate is of a population that had declined by 27% of the pre-disease population size, then the 2007 population (estimated to have declined by 64%) would be 10,000 mature individuals.<br/><br/>For both estimates, the potential error is high and still under discussion. The estimation of mature individuals is particularly subject to error since the disease has so reduced the proportion of older individuals: in disease-free sites, half of all individuals trapped are typically mature, but this proportion is much less in diseased sites (varying locally according to time since disease emergence). Acknowledging these provisos, the best estimate of total population size based on current evidence thus lies within the range of 10,000-25,000 mature individuals.<br/><br/>While Tasmanian Devil distribution across the state appears to be continuous, two management units have been identified, with devils in north-western Tasmania being genetically distinct from those found across the rest of the State (Jones <em>et al</em>. 2004; Farmer 2006).<br/><br/><strong>North-western</strong>. Jones <em>et al</em>. (2004) identified a genetically distinct management unit in northwestern Tasmania, across approximately 13,400 km², west of the Forth river and south to Macquarie Heads (Farmer 2006). This region encompasses four sites intensively surveyed by the Devil Disease Team since 2004, and one surveyed by C. Hawkins (unpubl.) in 2003. One of the Devil Disease Team sites, Woolnorth, holds the highest population density of Tasmanian Devils found in any of the Team's surveys, which is more than double that at the other sites. Extrapolating from the resulting density estimates, this management unit may currently consist of between 3,000 and 12,500 mature individuals. This management unit is not currently declining, but DFTD is expected to continue to spread into it.<br/><br/><strong>Eastern/South-western</strong>. The remaining 50,630 km² area covers nine sites surveyed by the Save the Tasmanian Devil Program since 2004. The mean of the density estimates for each of these sites applied to this area (separating formerly high eastern areas and from long term low density southeastern areas as described above) indicates an approximate population size of 7,000 - 12,500 mature individuals. <br/><br/>Jones and Rose (1996) related statewide survey results to environmental and climatic features, generating a CORTEX spatial model predicting distribution and relative densities across the state (Figure 1). Findings from mark-recapture trapping surveys and other trapping work by the Department of Primary Industry and Water (DPIW) Save the Tasmanian Devil Program broadly support these predictions for DFTD-free regions. However, in central and eastern regions, marked population declines have been detected, in association with the earlier reports of Devil Facial Tumour Disease (DFTD) (Hawkins <em>et al</em>. 2006; McCallum <em>et al</em>. 2007), subsequent to the time of the Jones and Rose survey. The north-west region is thus now thought to support the highest population densities.<br/><br/>The general population trend for the entire species is a decline (McCallum <em>et al</em>. 2007; Hawkins <em>et al</em>. 2006; DPIWE, 2005).",Decreasing,"The Tasmanian Devil is found throughout mainland Tasmania, Australia, an area of 64,030 km<sup>2</sup>. The species disappeared from the Australian mainland 430 +/-160 years ago (Archer and Baynes 1972), possibly through competition with dingos (Guiler 1982) and Aboriginals (Johnson and Wroe 2003). Tasmanian Devils were introduced to the small offshore Badger Island in the mid-1990s, but as of August 2007 all Tasmanian Devils were thought to have been removed from this island (N.Mooney unpubl.).<br/><br/>Tasmanian Devils were present on Bruny Island (a large inshore island off south-eastern Tasmania) in the early 1800s, but there are no confirmed records from after 1900. Tasmanian Devils also occur on Robbins Island, a large inshore island to the north-west, semi-connected to mainland Tasmania.",,Terrestrial,"As of May 2008, the Tasmanian Devil is listed as Endangered under the Tasmanian Government's <em>Threatened Species Protection Act 1995</em>. It is also listed as Vulnerable under the Australian Government <em>Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999</em>. <br/><br/>At the end of 2003, the Tasmanian State Government's Department of Primary Industries, Water and Environment (now Department of Primary Industries and Water) launched the Tasmanian Devil Disease Program to investigate and respond to the threat of Devil Facial Tumour Disease. This program, now called the <em>Save the Tasmanian Devil Program</em>, has attracted many collaborative researchers. A forum exclusive to those directly involved in DFTD research in February 2007 was attended by approximately 80 people. The mission of the Save the Tasmanian Devil Program is ""to maintain the Tasmanian Devil as an ecologically functional species in the wild"" (AUSVET 2005). Conservation actions, including research directed towards improving conservation management, are driven by three future scenarios that have the potential to turn the epidemic around and bring devils back into the landscape as an ecologically functional species (Jones <em>et al.</em> 2007). These are extinction in the wild and reintroduction, the evolution of resistance, and the broad-scale application of a vaccine. Four management actions can therefore potentially be employed: establishing insurance populations; disease suppression in wild populations; selection for disease resistance; and development of a vaccine (McCallum and Jones 2006). Each of these is included in the current Strategic Plan of the Save the Tasmanian Devil Program.<br/><br/><strong>Insurance strategy</strong><br/>The highest priority is to establish insurance populations of healthy devils in places isolated from the disease, firstly to avoid total extinction and, secondly, as a source for reintroduction to the wild if devils, and therefore also the disease, become extinct. Because these populations will possibly carry the species for 25-50 years and because devils already have low genetic diversity, a conservative retention of genetic diversity of 95% is recommended (Jones et  al. 2007; Save the Tasmanian Devil Program Insurance Population Strategy 2007). A large founder base of 150 individuals is recommended, to be built up to an effective population size of 500 individuals. This would mean maintaining an actual population size of about 1700 individuals, if they were all maintained in captivity where breeding is closely managed, or 5,000 individuals if they were all wild-living (Jones et  al. 2007; Save the Tasmanian Devil Program Insurance Population Strategy 2007). <br/><br/>Insurance populations would ideally be managed as a metapopulation of multiple captive and wild populations with managed migration between populations to maintain genetic diversity (Jones <em>et al</em>. 2007). Maintenance of wild as well as captive insurance populations is important because wild-living animals retain natural behaviours and natural suites of parasites, pathogens and commensals, all of which are progressively lost in captive animals (Jones <em>et al</em>. 2007). The options for wild insurance populations are offshore islands, and fenced enclosures on mainland Australia and disease free areas on mainland Tasmania. There are a number of issues to be considered with these possible types of insurance populations, including the number of potential sites, the number of devils that could be held, balancing the conservation value of the sites for other purposes, ecological functionality, biosecurity risk, whether the site is currently disease-free or whether disease eradication would be required (see disease suppression below), cost of establishment and maintenance, stakeholders and timescale. <br/><br/>To date, there have been three intakes of founders for captive insurance populations from the wild: 26 devils from eastern (n=13) and north-western (n=12) genetic provenances in 2005, 25 north-western founders in 2007, and 63 north-western founders in 2008. Founders were collected from as wide a geographic area as assurity of disease-free status permitted at the time (established though intensive and extensive surveys and including a buffer zone). This intake area gets smaller each year as DFTD spreads, and is currently the north-west corner and a strip down the west coast. Founder devils were accepted for collection according to a strict set of protocols: recently weaned and likely to be pre-dispersal, no biting injuries and no signs of sexual maturity / oestrus in females. The first two intakes were maintained in quarantine in Tasmania for 20 months and 8 months, respectively, in facilities where there are no wild devils on the outside (e.g. suburban, island). The current intake will be maintained in quarantine for a shorter period. These founder devils are transferred to mainland zoos where they are managed by the Australasian Regional Association of Zoological Parks and Aquariums (ARAZPA).<br/><br/>A risk reduction document has been distributed to wildlife park operators and the zoological industry (DPIW 2005; Tasmanian Devil Facial Tumour Disease Management Strategy) outlining biosecurity measures to maintain the health of current captive populations. These measures include adaptation of husbandry protocols to include use of footbaths, employ appropriate waste disposal principles or secure enclosures to prevent contact between wild and captive Tasmanian Devils. Actions have been moderately successful in terms of increasing biosecurity at existing wildlife parks. An intra-state movement guideline was established requiring special permits to transfer Tasmanian Devils between parks.<br/><br/>Updates on the disease and quarantine protocols are regularly disseminated to all stakeholders. <br/><br/><strong>Disease suppression adaptive management trial</strong><br/>The only technique currently available to manage or even eradicate the disease in wild populations is detection and removal (euthanasia) of infected individuals. This comes lower in the decision tree than establishment of insurance populations (McCallum and Jones 2006), but is also part of an insurance strategy (McCallum and Jones submitted). If this technique works, it is a means of eradicating the disease in isolatable areas. If eradication is not achievable, disease suppression is still potentially a cost-effective way of protecting wild devil populations (per devil cost per annum of A$1,000 cf. A$12,000 to maintain a devil in captivity). Disease suppression has other uses as well, such as maintaining buffer zones around fenced enclosures and eradicating incursions (McCallum and Jones submitted).<br/><br/>An adaptive management trial in disease suppression commenced in January 2006 (after an 18-month pilot study) on the Forestier peninsula, where the disease has newly arrived and prevalence was low, and where movement of diseased Tasmanian Devils across a bridge and canal can be restricted. Work is underway with the state road authority and an engineering consulting firm to construct a barrier to devils on the bridge. Diseased Tasmanian Devils are being removed from the peninsula population through intensive trapping, in the hope of reducing or extirpating the disease there and to learn more about possibilities of controlling DFTD elsewhere. If it is not possible to eradicate or even control the disease in this isolated site, it is probably not possible to do so elsewhere. The suppression has succeeded in limiting the extent of the population decline, age structure changes and geographic spread and the size of the tumours now being detected is smaller (Jones <em>et al</em>. 2007, unpubl.).

Jones unpubl.).<br/><br/><strong>Selection for resistance </strong><br/>Research is in progress to identify resistant genotypes, in the MHC gene complex associated with tumour recognition (Siddle <em>et al</em>. 2007), and in the peri-centric inversion in chromosome 5 (Pearse and Swift 2006). If resistant individuals are found, management could be directed towards artificial selection in captive or wild populations, or in translocating resistant individuals to depleted parts of the devil's range.<br/><br/>Current evidence suggests that lack of diversity at the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) is responsible for the disease being able to transmit between devils (Siddle <em>et al</em>. 2007). There is evidence that some individuals from the as yet uninfected West Coast have MHC profiles that differ from those found in the infected Eastern populations (Belov pers. comm).

To be effective for disease control in wild populations in Tasmania, much of which is rugged and inaccessible by vehicle, a vaccine would need to be orally delivered, preferably by aerial baiting.<br/><br/>Research into treatment using cytotoxic drugs is underway.

It also inhabits dry equatorial forests. It thrives in degraded habitats and man-made environments, and is occasionally found in pristine lowland and montane rainforests, but generally prefers open or disturbed habitat such as tracks, roads, low grassland and areas that are near human settlement, e.g. grazing land, suburban parks and gardens. It tends to avoid more densely vegetated areas (eg. wet sclerophyll and rainforest), which can then act as a barrier to their dispersal. It can be found by day beneath fallen trees, loose boards, matted coconut leaves, and similar cover (Lynn 1940). It feeds on arthropods (especially ants and termites) and small vertebrates. It is flexible regards breeding site (Evans <em>et al.</em> 1996); eggs and larvae develop in slow or still shallow waters of ponds, ditches, temporary pools, reservoirs, canals, and streams. Clutch size is between 8,000 and 17,000. Eggs and tadpoles are poisonous and displace native tadpoles. It may sometimes breed in slightly brackish water in Hawaii.

13482515,40795,Nactus coindemirensis,Vulnerable,D2,2021,2020-05-08 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"Listed as Vulnerable on the basis that this species is known to survive on four small islets following severe historical declines and local extinctions, most recently the loss of the Flat Island subpopulation in 2011. The population is presently stable following the removal of invasive mammalian predators from the largest subpopulation on Gunner's Quoin and the species is subject to ongoing monitoring. The population is exposed to predation by exotic ants and reintroduced native predators; it is not thought to be at immediate risk of extinction so long as ongoing conservation management continues. This situation will rapidly change should Gunner's Quoin be invaded by invasive predators/competitors, such as House Geckos, rats, shrews or wolf snakes, which have so far been prevented by conservation actions, but remains a plausible future threat, potentially facilitated by illegal visits to the islands where the species survives. The restricted range of the Lesser Night Gecko on the four small islets makes the species potentially highly susceptible to stochastic events including fire and storms.","The Lesser Night Gecko is nocturnal and insectivorous (Arnold and Jones 1994, Cole 2005, Cole <em>et al.</em> 2009), although animals also consume nectar. The species is mostly found in coastal habitats on cliffs and in areas of large rock piles and bedrock with multiple deep crevices and cavities. Geckos also occupy dense mats of the native grass, <em>Zoysia tenuifolia</em> and areas of deep leaf litter and root systems of native and non-native vegetation. They will climb native and non-native trees and palms, taking refuge under loose bark and within palm crowns. They are highly cryptic and their base colour varies to match the colour of their habitat (Cole 2009). The average total body length and weight of adult geckos is 6 cm and 0.77 g, respectively, and their tail makes up half of the body length (Cole 2005, Cole <em>et al. </em>2009). Female geckos are generally larger and bulkier than males. Larger reptilian predators, such as the endemic Keel-scaled Boa <em>Casarea dussumieri </em>and Telfair’s Skink<em> Leiolopisma telfairii</em>, which have been reintroduced to Gunner’s Quoin, predate the gecko and they are occasionally taken by the native land crab <em>Geograpsus grayi</em> (N. Cole pers. obs.). The geckos are highly vocal, producing a loud repeated metallic ‘tchick’ sound, from which they can be easily identified from all other non-<em>Nactus</em> gecko species in Mauritius (Arnold and Jones 1994, Cole 2009). The geckos call mostly at dusk and dawn, which has been used in combination with visual searches to survey the Mascarenes and outer islands for night gecko populations (Cole 2005, N. Cole unpublished data). The geckos can reproduce throughout the year, but gravid geckos are mostly encountered between June and February, with most hatchlings found from January to April (N. Cole unpublished data). Females lay one egg at a time and as often as every 25 days (Goble and Goetz 2011). At a temperature of 24/27 ºC (Night/Day) eggs hatched between 102–106 days and at 25/29ºC (Night/Day) eggs hatched between 82–95 days (Goble and Goetz 2011). Geckos reach maturity at eight months (Goble and Goetz 2011). Longevity is thought to be approximately four years (Goble and Goetz 2011), but individuals on Ile Marianne, in the absence of predators, have been repeatedly detected for up to seven years (MRRP unpublished data).","Historically, the Lesser Night Gecko has undergone a catastrophic decline, following the arrival of humans and the resulting loss of habitat and introduction of numerous non-native species from the 1500s (Cheke and Hume 2008). The introduced House Gecko <em>Hemidactylus frenatus</em> has been shown to predate and exclude Lesser Night Geckos from shared refuges, potentially exposing them to higher levels of predation and severe weather (Cole 2005, Cole <em>et al.</em> 2005). The House Gecko also has the potential to outcompete Lesser Night Geckos for shared food resources (Cole 2005). The Lesser Night Gecko does not persist in the presence of the House Gecko (Arnold and Jones 1994), but previously survived on Flat Island, where House Geckos were present but excluded from the powdery rock which the night geckos occupied (Cole <em>et al</em>. 2005). The invasive Big-headed Ant <em>Pheidole megacephala</em>&#160;predates and injures Lesser Night Geckos, although the extent of their impact is currently unknown. There are risks of further ant species invasions, such as Tropical Fire Ants <em>Solenopsis geminata</em>, which are known to predate the Lesser Night Geckos (Cole 2005). The invasion of Flat Island by the Musk Shrew in 2010 and the rapid extinction of the islet’s Lesser Night Gecko population, demonstrates the threat posed by this invasive predatory mammal. Not all invasive predatory mammals pose the same threat, as the Lesser Night Geckos survived on Gunner’s Quoin in the presence of Norway Rats for approximately 150 years, prior to rat eradication in 1995 (Cheke and Hume 2008). Both the Lesser Night Gecko and Durrell’s Night Gecko <em>Nactus durrellorum</em>, which had been experimentally released on Ilot Chat (0.029 ha) in 2006 to test the co-existence of the two species, did not survive the invasion of a single Ship Rat <em>Rattus rattus</em> in 2007 (Cole <em>et al</em>., 2009). Other potential invasive alien species in Mauritius that are a threat to the Lesser Night Gecko and known to cause rapid declines and the extirpation of small endemic terrestrial reptiles include the Indian Wolf Snake <em>Lycodon aulicus </em>and Tailless Tenrec <em>Tenrec ecaudatus </em>(Cole 2005, Cole <em>et al. </em>2009, Goder <em>et al</em>. 2015, MRRP unpublished data). The rate of offshore island invasion events is approximately three non-native fauna incursions per year, several of which have posed a significant threat to terrestrial biodiversity (Cole and Payne 2015). In most cases, staff of the Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust, Mauritian Wildlife Foundation and National Parks and Conservation Service through the Mauritius Reptile Recovery Programme have prevented non-native species incursions from establishing, although the risk of species arriving, for which there are no current methods for removal (such as house geckos or musk shrews) is high. All of the islets where the Lesser Night Gecko survives are closed to public access, but trespassers frequently access Gunner’s Quoin, Ile Marianne and Ilot Vacoas. Illegal access to the islets poses a risk of species introduction, but also from trampling, where crevices in which the geckos take refuge and deposit their eggs are crushed under foot. On Ilot Vacoas, the small area of rock occupied by the geckos is often covered in discarded charcoal or hot cooking oil from trespassers barbequing on the islet. Given the restricted range of the species, invasive predators and competitors, extreme weather, intense cyclones and fire all represent a significant threat to the survival of the species.","The global population of Lesser Night Gecko is estimated at approximately 18,000 individuals and currently considered stable. The largest subpopulation is found on Gunner’s Quoin, where in 2018, 37 line transects walked at night using distance sampling methodology estimated the population size at 16,753 (95% CI, range 11,861–23,663) adults (MRRP, unpublished data). Annual surveys of the subpopulation on Gunner’s Quoin since 2006 shows some fluctuation between 12,000 and 18,000 individuals, but overall the population is stable. Pigeon House Rock was last surveyed in 2004 (Cole 2005), where the population size has been extrapolated from encounter rate survey data to be approximately 200 individuals. The Pigeon House Rock subpopulation is considered to be stable, due to the remoteness and isolation of the islet from human disturbance. The gecko population size on Ilot Vacoas was estimated, through capture mark recapture method, at 237 (95% CI, range 136–413) adults in 2018 (MRRP, unpublished data). Annual surveys of the population on Ilot Vacoas since 2006, shows some fluctuation between 200 and 400 individuals, but overall the population is stable. The translocated subpopulation on Ile Marianne was estimated, through the capture mark recapture method, at 528 (95% CI, range 373–747) adults in 2019 (MRRP, unpublished data), following the release of 75 captive bred and wild caught individuals, originating from Ilot Vacoas in 2011 (MRRP 2011).",Stable,"This species is endemic to Mauritius and once thought to have been found throughout much of Mauritius and its surrounding islets. The introduction of non-native predators and competitors from the 16th century (Cheke and Hume 2008) has led to a catastrophic reduction in the gecko’s geographic range (Arnold and Jones 1994, Cole 2005, Cole <em>et al</em>. 2005, MRRP (Mauritius Reptile Recovery Programme)&#160; 2011a). The species was discovered in 1982 on Gunner’s Quoin (0.70 km<sup>2</sup>; Bullock <em>et al. </em>1985), but had a severely restricted range here due to the presence of introduced Norway Rats <em>Rattus norvegicus.</em> By 1993, the species was considered extinct (Arnold and Jones 1994) and was erroneously (as no captive population existed) listed in a 1996 Red List assessment as ‘Extinct in the Wild’. In 1996, one year post rat eradication, the gecko population was rediscovered within restricted coastal rocky areas on Gunner’s Quoin (Dulloo <em>et al.</em> 1996) and by 2003, geckos were abundant around all coastal areas of the island (Cole 2005). Additional small subpopulations were discovered on Ilot Vacoas in 1993 (0.01 km<sup>2</sup>; Arnold and Jones 1994), Pigeon House Rock in 1998 (0.01 km<sup>2</sup>; Probst and Tézier 1998), and a small isolated rocky area on Flat Island in 2003 (2.53 km<sup>2</sup>; Cole 2005, Cole <em>et al.</em> 2005). The Flat Island subpopulation was estimated at 61 (95% confidence interval,&#160; range 44–85) adult geckos in 2010, but following the invasion of the island by Musk Shrews <em>Suncus murinus</em> in the same year, the Flat Island subpopulation became extinct in 2011 (Cole 2011). In 2011, 75 wild caught and captive-bred geckos from Ilot Vacoas were translocated to Ile Marianne (0.02 km<sup>2</sup>; MRRP 2011), where the subpopulation has now become established (MRRP unpublished data).The Lesser Night Gecko has restricted ranges on each of the four islets, occupying 0.33 km<sup>2</sup> on Gunner’s Quoin, 0.001 km<sup>2</sup> on Ile Marianne, 0.001 km<sup>2</sup> on Ilot Vacoas and 0.005 km<sup>2</sup> on Pigeon House Rock. However, using the Geospatial Conservation Assessment Tool (GeoCat) the area of occupancy is 20 km<sup>2 </sup>and the extent of occurrence is 251.2 km<sup>2</sup>. The elevation range of the species is from 0 to 125 m above sea level.","Whilst there may be demand for the species within the pet trade, there are currently no individuals known to exist in captivity, legally or otherwise. The capture of endemic reptile in Mauritius is not permitted without the authorization of the National Parks and Conservation Service, Ministry of Agro-Industry and Food Security, Government of Mauritius.",Terrestrial,"The conservation of the Lesser Night Gecko is part of an ongoing conservation programme by the Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust, Mauritian Wildlife Foundation and National Parks and Conservation Service to restore the reptile communities on the offshore islets of Mauritius (Cole <em>et al.</em> 2009). All four islets that support Lesser Night Gecko populations are closed to public access, with Gunner’s Quoin and Ile Marianne designated as Closed Islet Nature Reserves and Ilot Vacoas and Pigeon House Rock designated as Closed Islet National Parks. The removal of rats from Gunner’s Quoin and ensuring, where possible, that the islets remain free from invasive competitors and predators has permitted the survival of the species. Whilst the loss of the Flat Island subpopulation to the invasion of the Musk Shrew in 2011 caused a decline in the extent of occurrence, the establishment of the population on Ile Marianne from the conservation introduction in 2011 led to an overall increase in the species abundance and range. Plans to translocate lesser night geckos to the Closed Nature Reserve Round Island (2.19 km<sup>2</sup>) from 2020 are underway. Round Island is a key restoration site where public access is prohibited and protected by the permanent presence of staff and wardens, jointly managed by the Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust, Mauritian Wildlife Foundation, and National Parks and Conservation Service (Jones 2008). Ongoing activities to restore the plant community on Round Island, particularly the reintroduction of native hardwoods (Jones 2008), is likely to improve habitat and food resources for the night gecko. The Mauritian Wildlife Foundation has been running educational workshops and site visits with government departments, tour operators, private boat owners and fishermen that use the southeast and northern islets to work towards reducing associated threats, which will benefit the lesser night gecko populations.

Eighteen of the 30 subpopulations occur in small isolated patches of exotic vegetation, which predominantly consists of <em>Eucalyptus tereticornis</em>, <em>Haematoxylum campechianum</em>, <em>Mangifera indica</em> and/or <em>Terminalia arjuna</em> trees, which are generally scattered and probably act as ecological traps (Buckland e<em>t al.</em> 2014b). In some of these 18 subpopulations, geckos persist on one or a few trees, where their long-term persistence is not viable. The 18 subpopulations are isolated from one another by urban and agricultural areas where geckos do not survive. The other 12 subpopulations that survive in pockets of native forest are surrounded by highly degraded habitat consisting of dense stands of non-native invasive guava <em>Psidium cattleianum</em>, where migration between subpopulations is thought to be minimal (Buckland <em>et al</em>. 2014c). Mature trees supply cavities, which are essential for geckos to take refuge and lay their eggs. The reproductive season is usually between July and April, with females depositing two eggs per clutch. The mean home range size of adult males is 77.0 (range: 31.6–158.3) m<sup>2</sup> and 26.6 (range: 1.9–67.6) m<sup>2</sup> for females (Buckland <em>et al.</em> 2014b).","Historically, the Lowland Forest Day gecko population has declined as a result of human occupation of Mauritius from the 1500s that led to the introduction of non-native species and widespread habitat destruction. Introduced predators, such as rats (<em>Rattus rattus</em>), cats (<em>Felis catus</em>), myna birds (<em>Acridotheres tristis</em>), Indian house crows (<em>Corvus splendens</em>), red-whiskered bulbul (<em>Pycnonotus jocosus</em>), the agamid lizard <em>Calotes versicolor</em> and the Indian Wolf Snake (<em>Lycodon aulicus</em>) that are known predators of Mauritian <em>Phelsuma</em> on the mainland are thought to have contributed to declines. The Common House Gecko (<em>Hemidactylus frenatus</em>), which is a known competitor of the Ornate Day Gecko<em> Phelsuma ornata</em> (Cole 2005, Cole and Harris 2011) is also a likely competitor of the Lowland Forest Day Gecko. The Big-headed Ant (<em>Pheidole megacephala</em>) and Tropical Fire Ant (<em>Solenopsis geminata</em>) predate juvenile and adult geckos, although the extent of their impact is currently unknown (Cole 2005). The Madagascar Giant Day Gecko (<em>Phelsuma grandis</em>) is a recently-introduced threat that arrived in Mauritius through the pet trade in the 1990s. Research has shown that the abundance of Mauritian <em>Phelsuma</em> is 89% lower than expected, and in some cases the natives are completely absent, in the presence of the Madagascar Giant Day Gecko (Buckland <em>et al.</em> 2014a). The Madagascar Giant Day Gecko is a known predator and suspected competitor of Mauritian <em>Phelsuma</em>. Currently one of the extant subpopulations of the Lowland Forest Day Gecko is invaded by the Madagascar Giant Day Gecko and its predicted suitable range is likely to threaten a further 11 subpopulations (Buckland <em>et al</em>. 2014a). Several subpopulations of Lowland Forest Day Geckos recorded in the 1970s close to the capital Port Louis (Vinson 1976) no longer exist, in areas which have now been invaded by the Madagascar Giant Day Gecko. Given the restricted range of the lowland forest day gecko, habitat disturbance, invasive predators, extreme weather, intense cyclones and fire represent significant threats to the survival of the species.G","Based upon genetic research within ten of the 30 subpopulations the effective population size of each ranged between 44 and 167 (Buckland <em>et al</em>. 2014c). Based on the available habitat area for the other 20 subpopulations they are likely to have similar effective population sizes (Buckland <em>et al</em>. 2014b). The native population size is therefore considered to be below 40,000 adult geckos. Over the last 30 years documented losses of other subpopulations have occurred.

It has nonetheless experienced severe declines on the Mauritian mainland as a result of the introduction of the exotic giant day gecko. Should this species become established on any of this species' offshore island strongholds, it is likely to warrant immediate reassessment as at least Near Threatened.","The Ornate Day Gecko has a strong association with native dry habitat, particularly palm trees, although they will also occupy structurally diverse, non-native vegetation (Vinson 1976, Cole 2005, Harmon <em>et al</em>. 2007, Bungard <em>et al.</em> 2014). Agricultural land and areas that include monotypic stands of non-native vegetation, such as the false acacia (<em>Leucaena leucocephala</em>), represent poor habitat for the species, where gecko abundance is extremely low (Cole 2005, 2009; Cartwright <em>et al.</em> 2014). The gecko is arboreal and saxicolous and can survive in open rocky areas with crevices, cavities and boulder piles (Vinson and Vinson 1969; Cole 2005, 2009; Cole <em>et al.</em> 2018), which may explain its persistence in urbanized areas. The presence of tree and rock cavities and crevices is important for the presence of the species (Cole 2005, Bungard <em>et al.</em> 2014), as these are essential for geckos to take refuge and lay their eggs. The reproductive season is usually between July and April, with females depositing two eggs per clutch, often in communal sites. They are predominantly diurnal, although animals can also be found foraging on moonlit nights and around electric light sources (Cole 2009, Cole and Harris 2011). The total average length of adult geckos is 10 cm and they feed mostly upon invertebrates, but will also consume fruit, nectar, tree resin and small geckos, and are occasionally cannibalistic (Vinson and Vinson 1969, Nyhagen <em>et al.</em> 2001, Cole 2009, Cole and Harris 2011). Ornate Day Geckos are important pollinators of threatened Mauritian endemic plants (Nyhagen <em>et al.</em> 2001, Olesen <em>et al.</em> 2002, Hanson<em> et al.</em> 2006) and prey items of the threatened Mauritius Kestrel (<em>Falco punctatus</em>), Mauritius Bulbul (<em>Hypsipetes olivaceus</em>), Mauritius Fody (<em>Foudia rubra</em>), Keel-scaled Boa (<em>Casarea dussumieri</em>), Telfair’s Skink (<em>Leiolopisma telfairi</em>i) and Günther’s Gecko (<em>Phelsuma guentheri</em>) (Cheke 1987, Jones 1987, Garrett<em> et al</em>. 2007, Cole <em>et al</em>. 2009, Zuël 2009).","Introduced predators, such as cats (<em>Felis catus</em>), Musk Shrews (<em>Suncus murinu<sub>s</sub></em>), rats (<em>Rattus rattu</em>s), Indian House Crows (<em>Corvus splendens</em>), myna birds (<em>Acridotheres tristis</em>), Red-whiskered Bulbuls (<em>Pycnonotus jocosus</em>), the agamid lizard <em>Calotes versicolor</em>, Indian Wolf Snakes (<em>Lycodon aulicus</em>), Madagascar Giant Day Geckos (<em>Phelsuma grandis</em>), Panther Chameleons (<em>Furcifer pardalis</em>), Big-headed Ants (<em>Pheidole megacephala</em>), Tropical Fire Ants (<em>Solenopsis geminata</em>) and Yellow Crazy Ants (<em>Anoplolepis gracilipes</em>) are known predators of the Ornate Day Gecko (Cole 2005, 2009, N. Cole unpublished data). The common house gecko (<em>Hemidactylus frenatus</em>) is a known competitor of the ornate day gecko causing a decline in abundance (Cole 2005, Cole and Harris 2011). Habitat loss, encroaching industrial areas and agriculture, extreme weather, intense cyclones and fire represent general threats. The introduction of the Madagascar giant day gecko through the pet trade in the 1990s potentially represents the greatest threat to the persistence of the ornate day gecko. Research has shown that the abundance Mauritian <em>Phelsuma</em> is 89% lower than expected, and in some cases the native species are completely absent, in the presence of the Madagascar Giant Day Gecko (Buckland <em>et al</em>. 2014). The predicted range of the Madagascar giant day gecko overlaps with the Ornate Day Gecko by 37%, but this is likely to be an underestimate as novel environments are likely to be invaded (Buckland <em>et al</em>. 2014). No terrestrial invasive vertebrate predators or competitors are present on two closed island nature reserves (Gunner’s Quoin with an area of 0.70 km<sup>2</sup> and Round Island with an area of 2.19 km<sup>2</sup>) where the combine adult population size is approximately 70,000 geckos (Cole <em>et al</em>. 2018, N. Cole unpublished data).","The population size is likely to be in the hundreds of thousands, if not more. Density estimates of adult geckos obtained through line transect distance sampling on island nature reserves have been shown to vary by habitat type (Cole <em>et al</em>. 2018). Average (95% confidence intervals) number of adult geckos per hectare for open rocky habitats are up to 20 (3–136) geckos ha-1 , up to 59 (24–143) in rocky habitats with palms and shrubs, from 215 (195–235) to 566 (489–643)&#160; in hardwood forests and 774 (616–973) in palm-rich habitats (Cole and Harris 2011, Cole <em>et al</em>. 2018). The gecko is common in lowland and coastal areas, including urban areas, but extremely scarce in agricultural land and monotypic invaded habitats (Cole 2005, 2009, Cartwright<em> et al.</em> 2014). Some island subpopulations appear to be stable or increasing in size as a result of habitat restoration (Cole <em>et al.</em> 2018). On the mainland subpopulations are in decline, particularly in areas where the introduced Madagascar Giant Day Gecko has established (Buckland<em> et al</em>. 2014).",Stable,"This species is found in most coastal and lowland areas of Mauritius, except the central south coast.

In coastal areas it occurs in remnant native vegetation, including&#160;<em>Pandanus</em> thickets. It also inhabits semi-dry tropical forests (west coast 200–750 m asl), low and medium altitude humid tropical forests (west coast 750–1000 m; east coast 0-900 m asl), and in the lower part of tropical moist montane forests (1,000–1,200 m asl). Above 1,500 m, it only inhabits specific areas well-exposed to the sun, such as streambeds, steep vegetated cliffs, cliffs and rocky ridges. Two high-elevation subpopulations (&gt; 2,000 m asl) are known, in which geckos exhibit saxicolous behaviour, living in cliffs and/or rocky ridges (Sanchez and Probst 2017a). On the Agalela islands it occurs on coconut palms, dead casuarina trees, on banana palms and in buildings, and occurs in vegetated areas down to the strandline (Cheke 1975, Webster and Cardinouche 2013). The availability of egg laying sites (e.g. trunk and rock crevices, cavities), also used as retreat sites, could be a factor limiting populations dynamics of this gecko, but this remains to be tested experimentally (Sanchez and Probst, 2017b). The availability of thermoregulation sites could also be a significant limiting factor (Augros<em> et al.</em> 2017).<br/><br/>A study of reproduction conducted in one subpopulation located on the east coast of Réunion&#160; (800 m asl) reveals that the reproductive season is usually between June to January, with females depositing one or two eggs per clutch, which take a maximum of approximately 140–195 days to incubate. Reunion Day Gecko glue their eggs to the substrate. Approximately 90% of eggs that are deposited on <em>Pandanus</em> trunks hatch. In artificial eggs-laying sites, hatching rates ranged from 54% to 92% on metal supports (metal tubes and poles), and are evaluated at 90% on wooden supports (kiosks, information boards, etc.) (Sanchez and Gérard 2017). In captivity, geckos reach maturity within two years, and it could be similar in natural condition (Sanchez and Caceres 2019). The gecko’s diet includes insects, fruit pulp and nectar. The Reunion Day Gecko is probably a pollinator of several native plant species (Sanchez and Probst 2017b).","Eggs scars, bone deposits and historical testimonies all suggest that this species was more widespread on Réunion at least until shortly after human colonization in the 17th century. It is likely that a large population decline has taken place since, probably due to habitat modification and predation pressures by introduced alien animals. The expansion of sugarcane plantations on both the west and east coasts, have probably destroyed a large part of the former distribution area. Although much of this land clearance is historical, ongoing habitat modification and increasingly dense urbanization remain threats to this species on Réunion. Remaining natural habitats are under pressure from both deliberate and accidental fire, but the primary threat to this species in natural habitats is invasive plants, which close suitable open habitats and increase homogenization of the vegetation communities, as well as increasing the susceptibility of these habitats to fire, although the species can maintain subpopulations in certain invasive plant formations at relatively low levels of invasion (Sanchez and Probst 2017a,b). High-elevation subpopulations are at risk from illegal fires, which are followed by plant invasion. Subpopulations at lower elevations are threatened by clearing for cultivation and urbanization (Sanchez and Caceres 2019). Other threats include predation by and competition with several introduced mammals, reptiles and birds. Black Rats eat geckos’ eggs laid inside tree trunks (Sanchez and Gérard 2017) and Wolf Snakes (<em>Lycodon aulicus</em>) consume adult geckos. Predation by several other invasive species of mammals and birds, and the invasive Giant Day Gecko <em>Phelsuma grandis</em>, is suspected (Sanchez and Caceres 2019), although sympatry between the latter species and <em>P. borbonica </em>has not yet been confirmed (M. Sanchez pers. comm. 2019).. Competition with invasive day geckos (<em>Phelsuma laticauda</em> and<em> P. grandis</em>) could become a major threat in future (Buckland <em>et al</em>. 2014, Sanchez and Probst 2014). Levels of exploitation for the global pet trade are unknown, and are not thought to represent a threat to this species, but some poaching of wild animals is likely to be ongoing. Nothing is known of any threats on the Agalela islands; based on satellite imagery these islands are heavily developed and cultivated with native vegetation surviving only on slopes, but the species appears to be common on exotic palms and around buildings on these islands.","This species was described as being ""numerous"" on&#160;both Agalega islands (Webster and Cardinouche 2013), but population trends here are unknown. Based on the number of geckos observed in each coconut palm tree and the number of coconut palms on islands (in the order of 400,000), Cheke (1975) gave an estimation of the population size run into several hundred thousand.&#160;Where the species survives on Réunion it can be locally common in well-preserved humid forest but is thought to have become rarer since human settlement, because of land conversion for agriculture, native habitats replacement by invasive vegetation and introduction of invasive animals, including invasive reptiles. Subpopulations in the west, centre and north of the island exhibit a high degree of fragmentation, while those in the east and south exhibit a more continuous distribution. Based on several transect counts, the size of the high-elevation subpopulation of Maïdo (2,200–2,350 m asl) has been estimated between 200 and 600 geckos (Probst and Abhaya 2004). In 2018, 50 geckos were translocated by the National Park, from Plaine Affouches (650–1,000 m asl) to Cap Francis (500 m asl), in the north of the island (Sanchez <em>et al</em>. 2016, Sanchez 2018). Prior to translocation a feasibility study was carried out in 2017 on the source population, which found that it contained several hundred of mature geckos, and that the species was more abundant in native than disturbed vegetation (Bonanno 2016). Additionally, the observed sex ratio differed between habitats, being 50:50 in native vegetation but male-biased in disturbed habitat (Bonanno <em>et al.</em> 2017).",Decreasing,"This gecko inhabits Réunion, where it is found mainly in the north, east, southeast and south of the island (but with some subpopulations in the west and centre), and both of the Agalega islands (part of Mauritius, and about 1,000 km north of the main island). It has an estimated extent of occurrence of 42,000 km<sup>2</sup>, although this is strongly inflated by the wide separation between the two island groups. On Réunion it has an area of occupancy of around 250 km<sup>2</sup> based on 2x2 km grid cells; its area of occupancy on the Agalega islands is unknown, but the islands have a combined area of 2,600 ha. It occurs between sea level and 2,800 m asl, but not continuously along an elevational gradient: there are subpopulations on Réunion both on the coast and elevations above 2,000 m asl. The distribution on Réunion is likely to be relictual, as subfossils (eggs and bones) suggest that before human settlement (and associated mammal invasions) in the 17th century the gecko may have been present throughout the island (Sanchez and Probst 2017a).","This is a very colourful gecko, and there is some trade in this species within Europe and the US. It is likely that some animals are collected from the wild presumably from Réunion (any exploitation of the Agalela subspecies is unknown) to support this activity, but there is no way to quantify harvest levels (M. Sanchez pers. comm. 2019).",Terrestrial,"A National Recovery Plan has been proposed to restore subpopulations of this species (Sanchez and Caceres 2019). Artificial egg laying site/shelter devices (AELS) have been tested to assist in the recolonization of a site destroyed by the construction of a water storage tank, but monitoring (2010–2014) demonstrated a very low recolonization of the area (&lt;4%) after the works, mainly as a result of a lack of wooded vegetation on the site. Geckos used 25% of the AELS for reproduction, mostly those located at the edge of the native forest, with at least 400 eggs laid during the monitoring period (Sanchez 2012, 2014). Preliminary results have shown that rats do not detect the eggs when they are deposited in these artificial devices hatch, but further research is needed to clarify whether these are effective at restoring natural subpopulations (Sanchez and Vingadachetty 2016, Sanchez and Gérard 2017).<br/><br/>As part of a European nature conservation project led by the National Park (LIFE +Forêt Sèche), aimed at preserving the semi-dry tropical forests a reintroduction has been conducted in 2018, notably with the aim of restoring the role of the gecko as a plant pollinator in this threatened habitat. Geckos were translocated from Plaine Affouches (650–1,000 m asl) to Cap Francis (500 m asl), located in the north of the island (Sanchez <em>et al.</em> 2016, Sanchez 2018). The release site was previously restored and rats were controlled since December 2017. The released subpopulation is monitored by the National Park using several methods (e.g, foot print, AELS control, visual search/baiting, photo-identification and photographic traps) (Couturier <em>et al. </em>2019, Piteau <em>et al. </em>2019). During the monitoring period (April 2018– April 2019), 11 different geckos were detected. One year after release, the probability of apparent survival (being alive and still at the site to release) is 0.02 [95% CI: 0.0002–0.10] and the probable number of remaining geckos on the site would therefore be estimated at 1 [95% CI: 0–5], a rate too low for the establishment of a viable population (Couturier <em>et al.</em> 2019).<br/><br/>Due to high level of genetic differentiation between subpopulations in Réunion Island (Thébaud 2013), more research is needed into the taxonomic status of this species.

Reproduction may take place throughout the year, but in two subpopulations subject to ongoing monitoring females seem to lay only one or two clutches of two eggs a year, laid in September with eggs taking 62–104 days to hatch. Survival rates of juveniles are probably low, particularly during the first year (Sanchez and Choeur 2019, A. Choeur and M. Sanchez unpubl. data).","Subfossil egg remains and historical testimonies are suggestive of a large population decline since human settlement, probably due to habitat modification and predation pressures from invasive animals. Habitat modification of native coastal vegetation, much of which has been lost, and urban expansion and intensification are threats to the surviving population. Remaining coastal vegetation is subject to degradation and replacement by invasive plants, and recruitment of new plants is low as a result of seed predation by rats (M. Sanchez pers. comm. 2019). As a result, the area of remaining suitable coastal vegetation is in slow decline even in the absence of direct land conversion (M. Sanchez pers. comm. 2019). These pressure contribute to population fragmentation. Other threats to the gecko included predation and competition by invasive mammals, reptiles and birds. Invasive Wolf Snakes (<em>Lycodon aulicus</em>) eat adult geckos. Predation is suspected or confirmed for several other invasive species (birds:&#160;<em>Pycnonotus jocosus</em>, <em>Acridotheres tristis</em>;&#160;mammals: <em>Mus musculus</em>, <em>Rattus rattus</em>, <em>Suncus murinus</em>;&#160;day geckos<em> Phelsuma grandis</em>; ants<em> Solenopsis geminata</em>) (Sanchez and Caceres 2019). Competition with invasive day geckos (<em>Phelsuma laticauda</em> and <em>P. grandis</em>) could become a major threat in the near future (Buckland <em>et al</em>. 2014). Levels of exploitation for the international pet trade are unknown, and unlikely to represent a major threat, but some collection of wild animals may be ongoing. This species could be strongly affected by climate change over the long term: projections for the end of the century suggest a rise in temperatures between 1.7 and 2.6 °C and an overall decrease in rainfall over the southwestern parts of the island in winter, encompassing the range of this gecko. The rise of temperatures and a strong dry season could respectively affect the population's sex-ratio and availability of food resources, and consequently increasing extinction risk (Sanchez and Caceres 2019).","This species is rare, which is presumed to be a consequence of historical land conversion for agriculture, replacement of native with invasive vegetation and the introduction of invasive animals. Bour <em>et al.</em> (1995) estimated the global population to be between 5,000 and 10,000 individuals, based on estimates derived from counts in multiple subpopulations. A subsequent intensive field study reported by Sanchez and Prost (2011) produced an estimate of 3,000–5,000 individuals, corresponding to 2,000 to 3,300 mature individuals based on observed ratios of juveniles to adults. These authors attempted to replicate the 1995 survey's methodology using transect surveys of the same localities, and estimated trends within each subpopulation based on these results, but Bour <em>et al. </em>(1995) did not report the amount of survey effort and the degree to which the results are comparable is consequently unclear (M. Sanchez pers. comm. 2019).<br/><br/>According to data collected over the last ten years (2008–2018), 52 fragmented subpopulations have been identified, within which, at least one is introduced. The status of many subpopulations is currently uncertain and several are probably extinct (M. Sanchez pers. comm. 2019). Manapany-les-Bains represents the largest population, in both size and area occupied; M. Sanchez (pers. comm. 2019) estimates that this contains 400–800 mature individuals, and fragmentation within this subpopulation has been observed as a result of roads, unsuitable areas of disturbed vegetation, and urban areas without suitable gardens. Monitoring of two subpopulations 60 m apart using photo-identification in natural cliff habitat subject to habitat management has been ongoing since 2015 (Sanchez and Choeur unpubl. data). These found that there is no exchange of adults between these subpopulations, which are separated by invasive shrubs, suggesting very low mobility (estimated below 40 m) in non-suitable vegetation. Adult recruitment between 2016 and 2018 was found to decrease in monitored subpopulations, hypothesized to be a consequence of low annual survival of juveniles (estimated at below 30%) and females (estimated at 52–66%) in both subpopulations during this period, compared with 74% for adult males. Between 2016 and 2018 mature population size at these localities declined by 44 and 38%. Modelling in VORTEX suggests that these subpopulations have a greater than 30% chance to become extinct within 15 years. The global population is considered to be severely fragmented.",Decreasing,"This species is endemic to Réunion, but its original natural distribution on this island is unclear due to the long history of human disturbance and its presumed extinction from much of its original range. It presently has a fragmentary and highly restricted distribution in the south, mostly within 100 m of the coast where it occurs in vegetation on coastal cliffs, but based on the known ecology of its Mauritian sister species&#160;<em>Phelsuma ornata&#160;</em>it may once have occurred throughout the west coast where semi-xerophilic vegetation historically occurred. Fossil bones and eggs of <em>Phelsuma </em>from elsewhere on Réunion's west coast may support this hypothesis, but have not been specifically identified. It is however possible that its distribution was always confined to the south of the island, perhaps as a result of competition with <em>Phelsuma borbonica </em>(Sanchez <em>et al.</em> 2009). Within the current distribution, there is some confusion surrounding which of the known subpopulations are native and which introduced as the species can persist in private gardens and at least one subpopulation is known to be introduced. Some, notably those in the township of Petite Ile and Saint Joseph, these may represent remnant subpopulations or unintentional reintroductions within the species' native range (M. Sanchez pers. comm. 2019). Overall the distribution is probably contracting, as a number of subpopulations were found to be close to extinction between 2008 and 2010 (Sanchez and Probst 2011) and many are likely to be extinct (M. Sanchez pers. comm. 2019). Within its presumed natural range it reaches elevations as high as 200 m asl (Sanchez and Probst 2011).","There is some trade in Réunion day geckos, including <em>Phelsuma inexpectata</em>, within Europe and US. It is likely that some animals are collected from the wild to support this activity (M. Sanchez pers. comm. 2019).",Terrestrial,"The Manapany Day Gecko benefits from a national recovery plan (Sanchez and Caceres 2019), and is part of a current conservation programme by the Nature Océan Indien NGO. Since 2012, restoration of native vegetation has been ongoing in two gecko subpopulations in native cliff habitats and monitoring of these subpopulations has been ongoing since 2015. Invasive shrub vegetation is gradually being replaced by native palm species. These populations have annually monitored since 2015 and evidence so far suggests that they are declining towards extinction despite management. The lack of monitoring of control subpopulations in areas not subject to management makes it impossible to determine whether these management actions have benefitted this species.<br/><br/>Predator control programme must be urgently carried out in an effort to slow observed rates of decline.<br/><br/>Since 2013 an NGO drive, called the “gardens and geckos” initiative, has promoted the conservation of subpopulations located in private, garden and urbanized environments. This participatory approach involves 150 inhabitants who committed to keep suitable vegetation in the gardens, avoid destruction of geckos and eggs, and avoid the use of chemical pesticides. Approximately 50% of the area occupied by the gecko in urban areas is now managed this way (Sanchez and Caceres 2019).<br/>In Manapany-les-Bains village, control of invasive populations of <em>Phelsuma laticauda</em>&#160;has been underway since 2018, and expansion of this and another invasive day gecko, <em>P. grandis</em>, are tracked as these species may represent a significant threat (Buckland <em>et al</em>. 2014, Lund 2016, Sanchez and Probst 2016). Research is needed to investigate the effects of threatening processes on this gecko, including this invasive species, and into the structure and genetic diversity within subpopulations. As the most recent population data available for this gecko dates to 2011, a re-evaluation of the species' distribution and the sizes of surviving subpopulations is urgently required (M. Sanchez pers. comm. 2019).<br/><br/>The species is listed in CITES Appendix II.",Afrotropical,,false,false,Global

It appears only to avoid the island's drier savanna and woodland habitats, clove plantations, and mangroves, and few individuals have been found in forest (Rödder&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2010). Animals have been recorded from 1.5 to 12 m above ground (Rödder&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2010), and appear to be most active in the afternoon between 15:00 and 18:00 (Rödder <em>et al</em>. 2010).","This species appears highly tolerant of anthropogenic disturbance, and from its rarity in natural forest it appears that it may have benefited from the expansion of plantations across much of Pemba (Rödder&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2010). It may be at some risk if unsuitable anthropogenic habitats, such as clove plantations and rice paddies expand, or if use of pesticides increases, but there is currently no indication that this is likely (Rödder&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2010). The introduction of <em>Phelsuma dubia</em>, which is ecologically similar to <em>P. parkeri </em>and is found on the nearby island of Zanzibar, is plausible due to regular boat traffic between these islands (Spawls<em> et al. </em>2002), and may be a possible future threat (Rödder&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2010). The likely impact of this species on <em>P. parkeri,&#160;</em>should it become established on Pemba is, however, unknown (Rödder&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2010). Pemba has one of the wettest climates in East Africa and may be affected by climate change in the long term, but<em> P. parkeri</em> is thought likely to be able to adapt to at least moderate climate impacts (Rödder&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2010). Recent export levels for the international pet trade are thought likely to be sustainable (Rödder&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2010), and demand is currently limited or nonexistent.","This species is considered to be widespread and abundant, being found in most habitats on Pemba with suitable trees, and at its most abundant in coconut and banana plantations (Rödder&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2010). It is, however, shy and difficult to spot (Rödder&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2010). These authors infer from the occurrence of geckos on seemingly suboptimal small banana plants and palms that all suitable trees may be colonized in areas where the gecko occurs; if this is the case, the gecko will be ""extremely abundant"" across much of Pemba (Rödder&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2010).",Unknown,"This species is endemic to Pemba Island, off the coast of Tanzania (Spawls <em>et al.</em> 2002).

It is possible that it occurs on Zanzibar but has been overlooked due to the presence of the Zanzibar Day Gecko <em>Phelsuma dubia</em>; alternatively as boat traffic between the two islands is common, it might be introduced to Zanzibar in future (Spawls <em>et al</em>. 2002). Pemba has a maximum elevation of less than 100 m asl.

On the Andaman Islands large  colonies have been primarily roosting in the mangrove trees of the  islands’ interior and in <em>Ficus </em>spp. within Evergreen forest habitats  (Aul 2007). On the Nicobar Islands, large colonies primarily occur among  wetland habitats in both mangrove trees and <em>Nypa fruticans </em>(Aul 2007).  Many of the roost sites throughout the Nicobar Islands were destroyed  following a tsunami in 2004, while the Andaman Islands were only  minimally affected (Aul 2007, Aul <em>et al.</em> 2014). In January 2005 only a small colony (10 -15 individuals) was observed roosting on  Casurina sp. in the littoral forest of Kamorta Island (Aul 2007). On  Great Nicobar and Tillangchong Islands, colonies moved to inland forest  areas. In April 2006 a colony (&gt; 500 individuals) re-established  following the recovery of <em>Nypa fruticans</em> (Aul <em>et al.</em> 2014).<br/><br/><strong>Ecology</strong>.—On  islands throughout the Andaman and Nicobar Archipelagos, where multiple  fruit eating bat species are present, competition for forage resources  has resulted in niche separation among the species (Aul 2007). <em>Pteropus  melanotus melanotus</em> is reported to forage on fruits of 21 species and  the pollen/nectar of one species (Aul 2007). Although there is some  overlap in foraging habitats and in the plant species consumed among the  bat species, <em>P. m. melanotus</em> forages later in the evening than other  bat species, starting at 2,300 h with a peak in foraging activity around 0200 h (Aul 2007). <em>Pteropus melanotus melanotus</em> prefers to forage in the  primary inland forest as compared to the agro forests preferred by  other species and will exploit foraging resources among the tree  canopies at heights &gt; 20 meters (Aul 2007).<br/><br/>Information on the  life-histories of <em>P. m. melanotus </em>is limited to the timing of birth and  mating, Females give birth to pups between the months of December and  April (Aul 2007). The mating season for <em>P. m. melanotus</em> is suggested to  occur in the months of May and June at the onset of the Monsoon (Aul  2007).<br/><br/><em>Pteropus melanotus natalis:</em><em><br/></em><strong>Habitat</strong>.—On Christmas Island,  <em>P. m. natalis</em> aggregates seasonally in response to reproduction (i.e.,  mating and birth), available food resources and weather (i.e., changes  in wind direction). In general, colonial roosts are primarily occupied  during the dry season for the purpose of mating, with regular movements  of juvenile, sub-adult and competing adult male bats between roosts  (Tidemann 1985, C. M. Todd and A. Dorrestein pers. comm.). During the  wet season a large portion of the population abandons the main colonial  sites, roosting singularly or in small groups across the island  (Tidemann 1985, C. M. Todd and A. Dorrestein pers. comm.). However,  during any time of the year small groups or single individuals can be  found scattered across the island (C. M. Todd and A. Dorrestein pers.  comm.). Some colonies have been used repeatedly for over 30 years and  are suggested to date back to 1908, before human settlement, while  others are abandoned for unknown reasons. In 1984, the first surveys  identified the location of five colonies. Three colonies were located  along the east coast of the island, one colony was located to the west  on the northwest point of the island, and one colony was located in the  middle of the southern coast. A sixth colony was later located along the  east coast in 1988 (Tidemann 1985). Several surveys conducted between  1997 and 2006 were only able to confirm the continued use of three  historical colony locations (Corbett <em>et al.</em> 2003, James <em>et al.</em>  2007). Recent surveys conducted between 2015 and 2020 confirm the  continued use of the two historical colony sites identified in 1984 as  well as an additional five new colony sites. All colonies were located  on the coastal terrace or close to the first inland cliff in  semi-deciduous forest with varying structural features. One common  feature among these locations is their proximity to the coast, which is  suggested to be advantageous as it allows <em>P. m. natalis</em> to take  advantage of on-shore winds, facilitating take-off (Tidemann 1985). The  average number of individuals occupying these established colonies in a  given month fluctuates between 119 and 762 individuals (C. M. Todd and  A. Dorrestein unpub.). Site fidelity at the colony fluctuates greatly  over the year, with a peak in adult roost fidelity during mating season  (A. Dorrestein unpub.). Generally, low roost fidelity coincides with  observations of multiple roosts, comprised of a single or few  individuals, scattered across the island. Eighteen plant species have  been identified as roost trees used by <em>P. m. natalis </em>(Tidemann 1985,  James <em>et al.</em> 2007, C. M. Todd pers. obs.). To date there does not  seem to be any information regarding the relevance of these particular  roost tree species.<br/><br/><strong>Ecology</strong>.—On Christmas Island, there is no  competition for foraging resources as <em>P. m. natalis</em> is the only bat  species present and the largest of two species that function as both a  pollinator and seed disperser, the other being the Christmas Island  white-eye (<em>Zosterops natalis</em>) weighing 12 g. <em>Pteropus melanotus natalis</em>  is relatively diurnal, emerging from camps as early as 1,300h to forage,  although the bulk of the population will emerge from the roost at dusk  between and 1,500 and 1,830 h (Tidemann 1985, C. M. Todd and A. Dorrestein  pers. obs.). <em>Pteropus melanotus natalis</em> forages on the fruits of 33  plants, the flowers of 33 plant species, the leaves of four plant  species and the stem of one plant species, representing a total of 56  plant species from 34 families (C. M. Todd unpub). The mean foraging  range for <em>P. m. natalis</em> was 237 ± 115 ha with some individuals traveling  up to 14 km between their roost and foraging sites (C. M. Todd unpub.).  These foraging movements by <em>P. m.natalis </em>indicate that they are capable  of foraging across the entirety of the island but prefer to forage in  perennial wetland, Evergreen and Semi-deciduous forest habitats (C. M.  Todd and A. Dorrestein pers. coms.).<br/>Recent studies on the  life-history of <em>P. m. natalis</em> have examined rates of growth, maturation  and the timing of reproduction events. Females give birth to pups  between the months of December and April (Todd <em>et al.</em> 2018). The  peak of the birthing period occurs in the months of February and March,  with newborn pups reaching volancy between the months of June and  November (Todd <em>et al.</em> 2018). The mating season for <em>P. m. natalis </em>occurs between the months of June and August (Todd <em>et al.</em>  2018), prior to the monsoon season in November. Although a majority of  the <em>P. m. natalis </em>population follows an annual cycle of reproduction,  mating, parturition, and volancy were not limited to the peak periods  and occurred with appreciable frequencies throughout much of the year  (Todd <em>et al.</em> 2018). Using estimates of growth and maturation  rates, juvenile males begin to mature at 15 months after birth and reach  maturity at 27 months, while females reach maturity at 24 months after  birth (Todd <em>et al.</em> 2018). However, adult male <em>P. m. natalis</em> reach  sexual majority at lower average body mass than a fully mature adult.  Mating success is suggested to be constrained until their fourth year  when males attain adequate body mass and are able to defend mating  territories (Todd <em>et al.</em> 2018).<br/><br/><em>Pteropus melanotus modiglianii</em>: <br/><strong>Habitat</strong>.—Suggested  to be similar to other subspecies, however no information is available  for either sub population the Mentawai Islands or Enggano.<br/><br/><strong>Ecology</strong>.—Suggested  to be similar to other subspecies, however no information is available  for either sub population the Mentawai Islands or Enggano.","<em>Pteropus melanotus melanotus.</em>—In the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, <em>P. m.  melanotus</em> is primarily threatened by hunting and habitat loss. Hunting  for sport appears to be the prime threat to the two species of fruit  bats on the Nicobar and Andaman Islands (Molur <em>et al.</em> 2002, Aul and Vijayakumar 2003, Aul 2007, Aul <em>et al.</em>  2014). Hunting seasonally occurs at foraging sites coinciding with the  Ceiba pentandra blossums and at roosts close to human settlements (Aul  and Vijayakumar 2003, Aul 2007, Aul <em>et al.</em> 2014). There is an  increasing trend of using air-guns and catapults to hunt which allows  for a quicker and more effective way to hunt bats (Aul 2007). Hunters  are known to shoot adult bats and adopt the orphaned babies.  Additionally, it is thought that bats, particularly the bones, have  medicinal properties and can be used to cure asthma (Aul 2007). No  hunting is carried out by the Onge’s who inhabit Little Andaman or  Tillangchong which is considered a sacred island (Aul 2007). Habitat  loss resulting from urbanization, in particular tourism related  commercial development programs, and conversion of land for agricultural  purposes is the second most common threat to <em>P. m. melanotus</em> on the  Nicobar and Andaman Islands (Molur <em>et al.</em> 2002, Aul 2007).  Anti-encroachment drives successfully stopped extensive logging  activities on the Andaman Islands, however logging still occurs on  Nicobar Island and has resulted in significant habitat loss across the  island (Aul 2007). In December 2004 a tsunami hit the Nicobar Islands  resulting in the destruction of major <em>Pteropus</em> mangrove habitat (Aul <em>et al.</em>  2014), however, further research is needed to confirm that the species  has declined because of this event. The tsunami also resulted in  clearing of forest land which has been made available for settlements.  Invasive species including spotted deer (<em>Axis axis</em>), African giant snail  (<em>Achatina fulica</em>) and elephants (<em>Elaphas maximus</em>) have also been  introduced to Interview Island and North Andaman but the threat to the  population remains unknown (Aul 2007). While threats to the species on  Nias are not known, they presumably include general habitat loss.<br/><br/><em>Pteropus  melanotus natalis.</em>—Threats to <em>P. m. natalis </em>have proven difficult to  identify, and are likely a combination of factors (Orchard 2006). James <em>et al.</em>  (2007), provide a detailed account of possible threats to the species  including, predation or disturbance by both, or either, introduced and  native species, predation and/or persecution by humans (mostly  formerly), storm events, loss of habitat, accidental poisoning or  intoxication from heavy metals, and disease and parasites. James <em>et al.</em>  (2007), also give a 'threat assessment matrix' indicating the  likelihood of each potential threat. <em>P. m. natalis</em> is preyed on by feral  cats on Christmas Island (Tidemann <em>et al.</em> 1994), and there has  also been some hunting, including large numbers (up to 200) in the past  (D. J. James pers. comm.). However, there is no recent evidence of  hunting in this part of the species range (C. M. Todd and A. Dorrestein  pers. comm.). Additionally, the introduced Yellow Crazy Ant (<em>Anoplolepis  gracilipes</em>) has caused general ecological breakdown on Christmas Island  since the late 1990s (O'Dowd <em>et al.</em> 2003), and is shown to disturb the species’ roosting behaviour (Dorrestein <em>et al.</em> 2019). Corbett <em>et al.</em>  (2003) hypothesized that a severe cyclone in 1988 initiated the decline  in the Christmas Island population. However, other anecdotal evidence  indicates that the decline began in the mid 1990s (Orchard 2006). Loss  of habitat and health related threats have also been suggested as  threatening processes to the population. Christmas Island houses the  second largest phosphate mine in Australia and approximately 25% (3,375  ha) of the island has been cleared for mining and settlement. A portion  of clear land (325 ha) has been revegetated with introduced/domesticated  plant species which might impact the diet of <em>P. m. natalis</em>. Nutritional  analysis of native and introduced plant species commonly consumed by <em>P.  m. natalis</em> found that alien fruits had significantly lower essential  mineral concentrations compared to native fruits (Pulscher <em>et al.</em>  2021). Therefore, preferential foraging, even seasonally, on alien food  plants could result in nutritional imbalances in <em>P. m. natalis</em>, however  further studies are required to understand the electivity of alien food  plants in the diet of <em>P. m. natalis </em>(Pulscher <em>et al.</em> 2021a).  Intoxication with the heavy metal cadmium (Cd) has also been suggested  as a threatening process in <em>P. m. natalis</em>. Increased cadmium  concentrations have been reported in fur, tissues, and urine of <em>P. m.  natalis</em> (Pulscher <em>et al.</em> 2021b). Furthermore, a small subset of  <em>P. m. natalis </em>individuals assessed had glucosuria and proteinuria that  were suggestive of renal dysfunction and bone lesions were reported in  one <em>P. m. natalis</em> individual suggesting that <em>P. m. natalis</em> is  chronically exposed to cadmium and this may be impacting the health of  the population (Pulscher <em>et al.</em> 2021). Disease (speculative) may  be a factor but little is known about infectious pathogens or parasites  in the population apart from two reports on baseline health parameters  and the identification of an unknown paramyxovirus (Hall <em>et al.</em> 2011, Hall <em>et al.</em> 2014, Vidgen <em>et al.</em> 2015). <br/><br/><em>Pteropus melanotus modiglianii.</em>—No information is available on the threats to this subspecies.","While data are limited within much of the species’ range, the number of  mature individuals is estimated to range from 5,00 to 7,000 bats. The  overall population and number of mature individuals has experienced a  decline in the past and there is a projected decline of at least 10%  over the next three generations (16.5 to 24 years, GL = 5.5 to 8 yrs,  Todd 2020).<br/><br/>The subspecies <em>P. m. melatonus</em> may consist of two  subpopulations, one subpopulation in the Andaman Island group and a  second subpopulation in the Nicobar Island group, as these island groups  with known populations are separated by 250 km. Surveys of <em>P. m.  melanotus</em> within each island group identify the presence of <em>P. m.  melanotus</em> on a number of islands within each island group but do not  provide estimates of population size for <em>P. m. melanotus</em> on each of the  islands in which it was present. No estimates of population size are  provided for the subpopulation of the subspecies <em>P. m. modiglianii</em> on the  island of Nias and the current status for the subpopulation of <em>P. m.  modiglianii </em>is believed to be extinct, however this requires  confirmation. Currently, detailed estimates of population size only  exist for the subspecies <em>P. m. natalis </em>on Christmas Island.<br/><br/>Surveys  of <em>P. m. melanotus </em>conducted between 2003 and 2006 identified colonies  ranging between 200 to &gt;1,500 individuals on the islands of North  Reef, Point, Paget and Landfall within in the North Andaman Island  Group, Interview in the Middle Andaman Island Group, and Havelock,  Outram, and Little Andaman Island in the South Andaman Island Group (Aul  <em>et al.</em> 2014). Throughout the Nicobar Islands two colonies were  observed, one containing 50 to &lt;600 individuals on Tillangchong  Island in the Central Nicobar Island Group, and one with 50 to &lt;200  individuals on Great Nicobar Island (Aul <em>et al.</em> 2014). In  addition to these colonies, individuals (population size unknown) were  observed on the islands of Kwagtung and West in the North Andaman Island  Group, Baratang and Long in the Middle Andaman Island Group, Neil,  Boat, and Rutland in the South Andaman Island Group, Tressa, Bompuka,  Katchal, Nancowrie, and Kamorta in the Central Nicobar Island group, and  Little Nicobar in the Southern Nicobar Island Group (Aul <em>et al.</em> 2014).<br/><br/>On  Christmas Island, the first surveys of <em>P. m. natalis</em> were conducted in  1984 which estimated a population size of 6,000 individuals (Tidemann  1985). This estimate was based on approximately 3,500 bats occupying the  five roosts, and 2,500 bats roosting singly or in small groups  throughout the island (Tidemann 1985). Tidemann (1985) also reported a  male to female ratio of 1:3 indicating a female biased sex ratio in the  population. In 2003 surveys indicated a dramatic decline in the  population, estimated between 500 – 1,000 individuals (Corbett <em>et al.</em>  2003). However, whether sufficient effort was invested during this  survey is questionable as the estimate is based on 17 sightings totalling  30 individuals, and it is not evident if counts were made at roosts  (James <em>et al.</em> 2007). In September 2006, the population size  was estimated to be between 1,500 and 2,000, but closer to 1,500. This  estimate was based on a count of 1,381 individuals (James <em>et al.</em>  2007). Density sampling methods conducted in 2012 reported a 39% decline  in the incidence measures between 2006 and 2012 and estimated a  population size between 900 – 1,300 individuals (Woinarski <em>et al.</em> 2012, Woinarski <em>et al.</em>  2014). Subsequent results from surveys conducted in 2013 (1,735 ± 602),  2014 (1,512 ± 503), 2015 (1,369 ± 534), and 2016 (2,100 ± 563) indicate  that the population has remained relatively stable (Parks 2016). In  September 2018 capture-mark-recapture/resight surveys estimated a  population of 3,846 individuals (Todd 2020). Surveys conducted between  2015 and 2018 indicate a juvenile to adult age class ratio of 1.43:1 and  a male to female sex ratio of 1.6:1 (Todd 2020). Density sampling also  indicated a 15% increase in the incidence measure between 2012 and 2019  (Parks 2019). Although recent estimates indicate a more recent increase  in the population size from 2012, there has been a relative decline of  36% in the population size from 1984 to 2018 (Todd 2020) and a decrease  of 28% in the incidence measure from 2006 to 2019 (Parks 2019), <em>P. m.  natalis</em> is projected to experience a 41% over the next 20 years (Geyle <em>et al.</em> 2018).<br/><br/>There  is no information available on the current population size for the  subpopulation of the subspecies <em>P. m. modiglianii</em> in the Mentawi  Islands. The current status of the subpopulation of <em>P. m. modiglianii</em> on  Enggano is suggested to be extinct.",Decreasing,"Currently there are three subspecies recognized within the <em>Pteropus  melanotus</em> group. <em>Pteropus melanotus melanotus </em>(synm: <em>Pteropus melanotus  tytleri</em>) may consist of two subpopulations with one subpopulation  limited to the islands of Kwagtung, Landfall, North Reef, Smith, West,  Interview, Baratang, Long, Outram, Neil, Havelock, Boat, Rutland, Little  Andaman, Paget, East Twin, Port Blair and South Sentinel Islands in the  Andaman Island group (Hill 1967, Aul <em>et al.</em> 2014, Srinivasulu <em>et al.</em>  2017). The other subpopulation of the subspecies <em>Pteropus melanotus  melanotus</em> is limited to the islands of Tressa, Bompuka, Tilangchong,  Katchal, Nancowrie, Kamorta, Little Nicobar, Great Nicobar (including  Campbell Bay), Car Nicobar, and Trinket Islands in the Nicobar Island  group (Saha 1980, Aul and Vijayakumar 2003, Aul <em>et al.</em> 2014). The  subspecies <em>Pteropus melanotus natalis</em> is limited to Christmas Island of  Australia. In the Mentawi Islands of Indonesia, the subspecies <em>Pteropus  melanotus modiglianii</em> has been reported to occur on Nias Island (Hill  1971, Molur <em>et al.</em> 2002), although the current status is unknown.  The subpopulation of <em>Pteropus melanotus modiglianii</em> on Enggano Island,  Indonesia was previously reported as extirpated following a severe  typhoon, however this requires verification. The species occurs from sea  level to 1,000 m asl.",,Terrestrial,"<p>Currently <em>P. m. melanotus</em> is categorized as vermin under the Indian  Wildlife (Protection) Act 1972, and special hunting rights are given to  the indigenous tribes in the Nicobar Islands. This, together with an  unsustainable use of the forest and wildlife are the greatest threats to  <em>P. m. melanotus</em>. Whilst, several protected areas, encompassing many  islands, have been created throughout the Andaman and Nicobar Islands,  in the Nicobar Archipelago, only four islands (Battimalv, Tillangchong,  Megapode and Great Nicobar) are protected (Aul <em>et al.</em> 2014).  However, no protection is provided to the species that inhabit these  areas. Furthermore, a number of islands which are home to endemic birds  and a variety of other fauna are currently not in the protected area  network. It is essential that a network of protected areas are  established on each island across the Andman and Nicobar islands to  ensure protected corridors enabling the safe movement of fauna across  the islands (Aul 2007).<br/><br/>On Kamorta, strides have been made  educating hunters and village leaders. Education and awareness programs  conducted in 2002 -2003 were successful in creating a network of bat  observers and roost protectors, dramatically reducing hunting in five  villages on the Nicobar Island of Kamorta (Aul 2007).<br/><br/>On  Christmas Island, National Park covers 63% of the island. A detailed  assessment of conservation status and threats is provided for the P. m.  natalis by James <em>et al.</em> (2007).<br/><br/>More extensive  field surveys across all of the Indonesian and Indian archipelagos are  needed to obtain a better understanding of the species’ distribution.  Currently estimates of population size are only available for <em>P. m.  natalis</em>. Further population assessments and monitoring are needed.  Genetic studies are urgently needed to better understand and clarify the  taxonomy of this species group. All future survey efforts should strive  to obtain necessary information (i.e., estimates of population size,  genetic samples, morphometrics) whenever possible in order to help to  facilitate proper monitoring of the populations.<br/><br/></p>",Indomalayan,,false,false,Global
22085511,18751,Pteropus poliocephalus,Vulnerable,A2ace+4ac,2021,2021-08-27 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"Grey-headed Flying Fox is assessed as Vulnerable under criteria A2ace and A4ac because, although the  population is relatively large (exceeding 10,000  mature individuals) and it has a large extent of occurrence (&gt;  20,000 km²), a continuing population decline is inferred to be  more than 30–35% over the last three generations (21 years, GL = 7  years; Pacifici <em>et al.</em> 2013). A decline is also expected to  exceed 30% over the period encompassing the past 1 and at least two future generations (2014–2035).<br/><br/>The decline in population is inferred from  substantial loss and degradation of foraging habitat due to fire and  clearing, mass mortalities associated with extreme heat and food  shortages, and mortality from electrocution on power lines, and  entanglement in barbed wire and fruit tree netting. In particular,  extreme weather conditions in 2019-20 saw tens of thousands of  individuals die from food shortages and extreme heat events, and  unprecedented megafires affected 33.7% of the species’ total habitat  whereby 41.7% of the species' critical ‘winter’ foraging resources were  lost to high severity fires.<br/>The rate of decline is expected to  increase over at least the future two generations due to the increasing  frequency and intensity of extreme weather and climate events such as  heat events, droughts, floods and fires, along with changes in the  production of nectar, pollen and fleshy fruits in native vegetation,  largely unregulated land clearing associated with urban expansion,  agriculture intensification and human population growth, and increased  exposure of the species to anthropogenic threats in urban environments.  The capacity of the species to recover from increased mortality caused  by frequent or persistent threats is hampered by their low reproductive  rate, and low population growth rate even under optimal conditions.","The Grey-Headed Flying Fox is found in subtropical moist forest, open  forest, closed and open woodlands, Melaleuca swamps, Banksia woodlands,  mangroves, commercial fruit plantations (Hall and Richards 2000), and  increasingly in urban landscapes (e.g., Williams <em>et al.</em> 2006, Plowright <em>et al.</em> 2011, Boardman <em>et al.</em> 2021, Meade <em>et al.</em> 2021).<br/><br/>The  diet consists of nectar, pollen and fruits of a wide range of species,  most commonly native trees in the families Myrtaceae, Moraceae,  Proteaceae and a small number of species from other families. (Eby 1998,  Hall and Richards 2000, Eby and Law 2008, Schmelitschek <em>et al.</em>  2009). The primary native food sources are the nectar and pollen of  <em>Eucalyptus</em>, <em>Corymbia</em>, <em>Angophora</em>, <em>Banksia</em>, <em>Melaleuca</em> species, and fleshy  rainforest fruits (Eby and Law 2008, Eby 1991); and they are known to  consume leaves, bark, and invertebrates (Clulow and Blundell 2011, Smith  <em>et al.</em> 2020, Schmelitschek <em>et al.</em> 2009). They also forage  in agricultural areas, including orchards, and in introduced vegetation  in urban areas (McDonald-Madden <em>et al.</em> 2005, Boardman <em>et al.</em> 2021).<br/><br/>The  majority of native diet plants have regular seasonal flowering  phenologies, but do not flower every year (Eby and Law 2008).  Grey-headed flying foxes experience seasonal food bottlenecks during  winter and spring when few diet plants are productive and the  distribution of native foraging habitat is limited (Eby and Law 2008).  Vegetation communities that contain plants that flower in winter and  early spring are of particular importance to the species during critical  periods in the reproductive cycle and have been identified as habitat  critical to survival (Eby <em>et al.</em> 1999, Eby and Law 2008, DAWE 2021).<br/><br/>The Grey-Headed Flying Fox lacks biological adaptations such as torpor to  withstand food shortages, instead individuals are thought to move in  response to changes in local food abundance (DAWE 2021). It is a highly  mobile species with individuals estimated to travel up to  2,500 km annually within a network of roosts located across southeastern  Australia (Eby 1991, Tidemann and Nelson 2004, Roberts <em>et al.</em> 2012a, Welbergen <em>et al.</em>  2020). On a nightly basis, individual bats may forage as far as 50 km  from their roost. However, mean foraging distances are between 6 and 11  km, with foraging distances shorter in urban than in non-urban areas  (Meade <em>et al.</em> 2021). There are few areas within the range where  nectar and other food sources are available continuously, except perhaps  in urban areas. While many flying-foxes feed in urban areas and urban  roosts may be permanently occupied, a proportion of the individuals  within these roosts move regularly between urban and other more natural  settings (Meade <em>et al.</em> 2021).<br/><br/>It roosts by day colonially in  canopy vegetation and many roosts have a long history of use (Lunney and  Moon 1997). Individuals move nomadically throughout the species' range  within a network of roosts, and change roosts frequently (Roberts <em>et al.</em> 2012a, Welbergen <em>et al.</em>  2020). Some roosts may temporarily contain &gt;100,000 individuals,  often coinciding with periodic flowering of preferred tree species (Eby  1991, Eby <em>et al.</em> 1999).<br/><br/>The Grey-Headed Flying Fox&#160;regularly  cohabits roosts with the black flying fox (<em>P. alecto</em>) and Little Red Flying Fox (<em>P. scapulatus</em>) with which it is partially sympatric (Timmiss  <em>et al.</em> 2021), and rarely with the Spectacled Flying Fox (<em>P. conspicillatus</em>) in the north of its range (Parsons <em>et al.</em>  2010). Of the 310 known camps in regular use, almost 75% are shared  with other species and only 25% are occupied exclusively by the Grey-Headed Flying Fox&#160;(Timmiss <em>et al.</em> 2021).<br/><br/>The majority of camps (58.7%) are located in urban areas (Timmiss <em>et al.</em>  2021). From 1998 to 2019, the number of active roost sites increased by  approximately 120% and average population size at camps declined, with  94% of new roosts formed in urban areas (Eby <em>et al.</em> submitted).  The pattern of increase in roost numbers has been stepped rather than  continuous, in association with periods of food shortage (Eby <em>et al.</em>  submitted). The drivers of increasing urbanisation of the species are  unclear. Increased temporal stability (Markus and Hall 2004,  McDonald‐Madden <em>et al.</em> 2005, Parry‐Jones and Augee 2001, Plowright <em>et al.</em> 2011, Williams <em>et al.</em> 2006) and availability (Markus and Hall 2004, Plowright <em>et al.</em> 2011, Williams <em>et al.</em>  2006) of food resources from urban plantings may be responsible for the  recently observed increased presence of flying-foxes of urban areas  (Meade <em>et al.</em> 2021), however, broadscale reductions in feeding  opportunities in native habitats may also play a role (Parry-Jones and  Augee 2001, van der Ree <em>et al.</em> 2006, Williams <em>et al.</em> 2006, Tait <em>et al.</em> 2014, P. Eby unpublished data).<br/><br/>In  the roosts, males establish ‘mating territories’ that are actively  maintained by aggression, which is especially evident during the mating  season (March-May, Martin <em>et al.</em> 1993; Martin <em>et al.</em> 1995; Eby 1995; Nelson 1965; Welbergen 2010, 2011). Males mate repeatedly  with the same female during a mating session and can have multiple  mating sessions with the same female over the course of several days  (Welbergen 2005). Males, but not females, accumulate body mass prior to  establishing their territories and can lose more than 20 percent of  their mass during the mating season (Welbergen 2011).&#160;&#160; <br/>The most likely time of conception is April (Martin <em>et al.</em> 1993, Martin <em>et al.</em> 1995). Pregnancy in <em>P. poliocephalus</em> is seasonal, lasts for approximately 27 weeks (Martin <em>et al.</em>  1987) and the majority of females give birth to a single young annually  between late September and early November, although small numbers of  females give birth outside this time (Justin Welbergen pers. comm.).  Lactation lasts approximately 5–6 months (Martin <em>et al.</em> 1996), with the majority of young being weaned by the start of the mating season in March (Welbergen 2011).<br/><br/>Twins  are rare and there are no observations of twins surviving to weaning  (Peggy Eby pers. comm.). Sexual maturity is reached in the second year  (females) or third year (males) after birth (Welbergen 2010), and  generation length is estimated to be between 6 and 8 years (Woinarski <em>et al.</em> 2014, A. Divljan pers. comm).","Grey-Headed Flying Foxes are exposed to significant threats from  increasingly rapid human-induced environmental change, particularly loss  of foraging habitat and climate change impacts (DAWE 2021). They are  also impacted by increasing levels of conflict with humans at urban  roosts (Roberts <em>et al.</em> 2021). Key threats often act concurrently  and their impacts on population size are exacerbated by the species’ low  reproductive output, limiting its capacity to recover from impacts  (McIlwee and Martin 2002). Threats are predicted to increase in  frequency and severity in coming decades and, as a result, rates of  decline are expected to increase (Woinarski <em>et al.</em> 2014).<br/><br/>The  species is dependent on continuous access to flowering and fruiting food  plants sourced from widespread areas of native vegetation. Reduction in  food availability from loss and degradation of native habitat and  impacts of climate change, particularly drought and fires, is a key  threat (Woinarski <em>et al.</em> 2014, DAWE 2021). Incremental clearing  of critical winter/spring foraging habitat for urban expansion and  agriculture intensification is largely unregulated and is ongoing in  many regions. For example, loss of critical winter habitat was  associated with a collapse in winter influxes of nomadic animals into  far southeast Queensland from 1996 to 2018 (Eby <em>et al.</em> submitted).<br/><br/>Climate-driven  food shortages affect the species throughout its range and are  associated with population-wide increases in mortality (assessed from  rates of intake by wildlife rehabilitation organizations) and reductions  in pre-weaning reproductive success (DAWE 2021, Eby <em>et al.</em> submitted, Mo <em>et al.</em>  2021). Food shortages were recorded every 3 years on average from 1998  to 2020 (range 1-4 years) and were associated with absence or very low  intensity of flowering in native forests (Eby <em>et al.</em> submitted).  Food shortage impacts are generally global across the range of the  species and pre-weaning reproductive success assessed over 23 years  (1998 to 2021) and averaged across roosts in New South Wales was 56% in  food shortage years relative to 89% in non-food shortage years (P. Eby  unpublished data). This represents only a partial assessment of impact,  as adult female mortality was not considered in the denominators. Roosts  affected by the impact of extreme heat were not included in the data.  Repeated reductions in reproduction may reduce the capacity of the  species to recover from decline.<br/><br/>Extreme heat events, whereby  ambient temperatures exceed 42°, are known to cause mass mortality of  flying-foxes at landscape scales, and this has become a prominent  conservation management issue in Australia. Welbergen <em>et al.</em>  (2008) reported that between 1994 and 2008, &gt;30,000 Australian  flying-foxes, of which 24,500 were <em>P. poliocephalus</em>, had died during 19  separate extreme heat events. Between 2008 and 2019 a further 131.00  flying foxes died in several such events, including &gt;40,000 <em>P.  poliocephalus</em> individuals (Welbergen 2021, Welbergen <em>et al.</em>  unpublished). During the 2019-20 summer, 72,000 flying foxes died from  hyperthermia during eight separate extreme heat events, with <em>P.  poliocephalus</em> individuals comprising the majority of the mortality  estimate (Mo <em>et al.</em> 2021). The recorded deaths are likely  substantial underestimates of the true mortality as many roosts are not  inspected following events and where inspected mortality is often  underreported (Mo <em>et al.</em> 2021, Welbergen, pers. comm.). Adult  females and dependent young are disproportionately susceptible to  hyperthermia, which negatively affects recruitment and the effective  breeding population limiting the species’ capacity for recovery  (Welbergen <em>et al.</em> 2008).<br/><br/>Wildfires have also recently gained  significance as threats to the Grey-Headed Flying Fox. During the  extreme Austral 2019–20 summer, unprecedented bushfires affected an  estimated 5.8 Mha of temperate broadleaf forest within <em>P. poliocephalus</em>&#160;range, burning 33.7% of the species’ total habitat. This included 41.7%  critical ‘winter’ habitat which burnt in high severity fires  (Baranowski <em>et al.</em> 2021). It is likely that significant impacts  of the 2019-2020 bushfires on the species will be associated with both  the short-term effective loss of foraging habitat and the longer-term  reduction in nectar production, particularly in areas affected by  high-severity fire. At present, there are insufficient data available to  estimate the impact on the <em>P. poliocephalus </em>population or predict its  trajectory of post-fire recovery.<br/><br/>Anthropogenic changes in extreme  heat events and associated droughts and wildfires are already readily  observable in southeastern Australia and are expected to continue to  escalate in frequency and intensity in the coming decades (IPCC 2021,  Herold <em>et al.</em> 2021). As such, the already substantial die-offs  from food shortages and extreme heat, and habitat loss from wildfires  are anticipated to continue to gain significance as threats to the  species.<br/><br/>The recent urbanisation of roosts exposes the species to  several threats. Conflict between people and Grey-Headed Flying Foxes&#160;is  an ongoing problem that may cause loss or degradation of roosting  habitat and reduce community support for conservation initiatives (DAWE  2021). Flying-foxes are commonly perceived to be an annoyance, or  disease risk due to the noise and smell they emit and camps close to  human settlements are regularly subject to attempts to exclude the bats,  or clear vegetation in or around roosts to manipulate fine-scale  roosting positions (DAWE 2021, Roberts <em>et al.</em> 2021, Welbergen <em>et al.</em>  2020). Other threats include entanglement in fruit tree netting or  barbed wire fencing, electrocution on power lines, and vehicle  collisions. In a study of 532 Grey-Headed Flying Foxes&#160;admitted to  emergency care in Victoria, Scheelings and Frith (2015) found  anthropogenic factors caused the majority (63.7%) of admissions, with  entanglement in fruit tree netting the most common cause (36.8%)  followed by entanglement in barbed wire fencing (12.4%). Roosts once  isolated from humans have become embedded in urban areas due to  increasing urban expansion in coastal New South Wales and Queensland  (DAWE 2021).<br/><br/>Grey-Headed Flying Foxes may cause damage to fruit  crops in both commercial and backyard orchards, and lethal control  methods were commonly used in the past, including electrocution and  shooting (DAWE 2021). Historically culling was a major cause of  mortality (Woinarski <em>et al.</em> 2014). However, there have been  efforts to reduce the number of flying-foxes killed by orchardists  through Government subsidised netting programs, and overall, the impact  of this threat has declined. Queensland still issues permits to cull up  to 1,280 individuals per year (DAWE 2021).<br/><br/>Interspecific competition  with the black flying fox (<em>Pteropus alecto</em>) may also be a threat to the Grey-Headed Flying Fox&#160;(Woinarski <em>et al.</em> 2014, Roberts <em>et al.</em>  2012b). Although there is no evidence of interspecific competition, the  black flying fox has been expanding both in range and abundance in the  northern parts of the Grey-Headed Flying Fox’s range (Woinarski <em>et al.</em> 2014, Roberts <em>et al.</em> 2012a).<br/>Apart from culling by orchardists, all other threats are likely to continue or increase in severity and impact into the future.","This species forms a single, extremely mobile, interbreeding population distributed over a vast area (DAWE 2021, Welbergen <em>et al.</em> 2020).&#160;The Grey-Headed Flying Fox&#160;was considered abundant and estimated to number  in the many millions in the early 20th century (Ratcliffe 1931).  However, distribution-wide autumn population counts, based on counts of  individuals at known camps across the species range, varied between  320,000 and 674,000 (mean of 450,714) between 1989 and 2005 (Woinarski <em>et al.</em>  2014). Subsequently a national program of largely synchronous quarterly  population estimates was established in November 2012 (Westcott <em>et al.</em>  2015), and its autumn population counts varied between 522,000 and  663,000 (mean 570.900) over the period 2013-2019 (NFFMP, 2021). However,  counts from the periods 1989-2005 and 2013-2019 are not directly  comparable because of the differences in the methods used and  uncertainty about the survey coverage of the extent of the population  (Westcott <em>et al.</em> 2015). In addition, distribution-wide counts  lack precision due to the unknown proportion of individuals at unsampled  camps, and inconsistencies in sampling effort and counting methods used  among individual roost sites (DAWE 2021, Woinarski <em>et al.</em> 2014, Westcott <em>et al.</em>  2015). Due to limited precision, the time taken to reach 80%  statistical power in detecting trends in the recent distribution-wide  counts has been modelled to be ~13.5 years, or until 2027 (Westcott <em>et al.</em>  2012). However, recent work suggests that the main method used for  counting individuals in roosts is much less precise than was assumed in  the modelling (McCarty <em>et al.</em> submitted). While efforts are currently underway to improve the reliability of count estimates (McCarthy <em>et al.&#160;</em>2021, McCarthy <em>et al.</em>  submitted), until precision of the distribution-wide counts is improved  and better defined, it is not possible to establish meaningful trends  using current timeframes of population monitoring.<br/><br/>During the austral  spring and summer of 2019–2020, <em>P. poliocephalus </em>was exposed to a  sequence of circumstances associated with prolonged drought and extreme  heat, which resulted in tens of thousands of deaths (Mo <em>et al.</em> 2021), near reproductive failure and the burning of over a third of its habitat (Baranowski <em>et al.</em> 2021).<br/> <br/>At  this time, the species experienced an extended and intense food  shortage across a broad area of northern New South Wales and  southeastern Queensland, resulting in a large but unquantified number of  flying-fox deaths, possibly in the tens of thousands based on anecdotal  reports from wildlife carers (Mo <em>et al.</em> 2021). Pre-weaning reproduction at that time fell to 6% from a 21-year average of 74% (P. Eby unpublished data).<br/><br/>In  addition, in the summer of 2019–2020, 72,000 flying-foxes died from  hyperthermia during eight separate extreme heat events throughout  eastern and southeastern Australia, with <em>P. poliocephalus</em> comprising the  majority of the mortality estimate (Mo <em>et al.</em> 2021). The  recorded deaths are likely substantial underestimates of the true  mortality as many roosts are not inspected following events and where  inspected mortality is often underreported (Mo <em>et al.</em> 2021, Welbergen, pers. comm.).<br/><br/>Furthermore,  in the summer of 2019–20, unprecedented bushfires affected an estimated  5.8 million hectares of forest within <em>P. poliocephalus</em>&#160;range, burning  33.7% of the species’ total habitat. This included 41.7% of the species'  critical ‘winter’ habitat which burnt in high severity fires (Baranowski  <em>et al.</em> 2021). It is likely that significant impacts of the  2019–2020 bushfires on the species will be associated with both the  short-term effective loss of foraging habitat and the longer-term  reduction in nectar production, particularly in areas affected by  high-severity fire.<br/><br/>Anthropogenic changes in extreme heat events and  associated droughts and wildfires are already readily observable in  southeastern Australia and are expected to continue to escalate in  frequency and intensity in the coming decades (IPCC 2021, Herold <em>et al.</em>  2021). In conjunction with other ongoing causes of decline that  contributed to the species’ previous listing as Vulnerable under  criteria A2ace, these extreme events are anticipated to amount to a  decline in mature individuals exceeding 30% over the period <em>ca</em> 2014–2035, equivalent to the previous one and future two generations under criteria  A4.",Decreasing,"The geographic range of the species has altered in the past 20 years as documented by range-wide monitoring (Westcott <em>et al.</em> 2012), satellite telemetry studies (Roberts <em>et al.</em> 2012a, Welbergen <em>et al.</em> 2020), a systematic search of field records (Roberts <em>et al.</em> 2012b) and public reporting. While latitudinal range boundaries have remained generally stable (Roberts <em>et al.</em>  2012b), there has been a distinct inland expansion. As of 2021 the  range spans the coastal lowlands, tablelands, and slopes of eastern  Australia, from Finch Hatton near Mackay (Queensland) in the north to  Melbourne, Geelong (Victoria) in the south (Roberts <em>et al.</em> 2012b, Woinarski <em>et al.</em>  2014) and inland to Port Augusta in South Australia, Cooma in the Snowy  Mountains of New South Wales (New South Wales), and areas of central  and southern New South Wales and Victoria including Dubbo, Wagga Wagga  and Albury (New South Wales), Numurkah and Bendigo (Victoria). There  have also been vagrant sightings outside of this range, including  occasional sightings in Tasmania and Bass Strait islands (Atlas of  Living Australia 2021, DAWE 2021). Sightings in Tasmania and islands in  Bass Strait are associated with periods of acute food shortage (Eby <em>et al.</em> 2021).<br/><br/>The  great majority of observations and camps of this species are from the  coastal lowlands and slopes of south eastern Australia below altitudes  of about 200 m (DAWE 2021, Welbergen <em>et al.</em> unpublished data).  However, known roosts vary in elevation from sea level to 800 m (Cooma),  and occasionally vagrant individuals have been reported from altitudes  up to 1,600 m in the New South Wales and Victorian high country (M.  Pennay pers. comm., Welbergen <em>et al.</em> unpublished data). Along the  southern periphery of its range, the species has increased in abundance  in urban areas including Canberra (Australian Capital Territory),  Melbourne, Geelong and Bendigo (Victoria), and Adelaide (South  Australia) (Woinarski <em>et al.</em> 2014).<br/><br/>The species is typically  found from sea level to 800 m asl, with vagrants being documented up to  1,600 m asl.","The species is not known to be hunted, used, or traded.",Terrestrial,"This species is known to use a broad range of areas reserved for  conservation, which make up 12.6% of the area surrounding known camps,  however, only 5.2% of the camps occur within conservation areas (Timmiss  <em>et al.</em> 2021). Given the species' reliance on dispersed food  resources, conservation areas are unlikely to protect sufficient habitat  for the species.<br/><br/>A range of management actions and research to  assist conservation of <em>P. poliocephalus</em> into the future has been  identified in the National Recovery Plan for the species (DAWE 2021).  They include: identify, protect and increase roosting habitat and native  foraging habitat that is critical to survival, define and improve  precision in current population monitoring to determine reliable trends  in population size, build community capacity to coexist with flying  foxes and improve management of conflict at roosts in urban areas,  reduce the impact of electrocution on power lines, and entanglement in  netting and on barbed wire, significantly reduce levels of harm in  commercial fruit crops, support research that will improve conservation  and management, develop and apply ameliorative care procedures to  minimise deaths during extreme heat days, and management of fire (DAWE  2021).<br/><br/>In recent years, governments have funded and administered a  number of programs of subsidies to improve conservation outcomes for <em>P.  poliocephalus</em>. Plans of Management for several roosts have been  developed by land managers in consultation with affected stakeholders  (Roberts <em>et al.</em> 2012). The plans set out programs for managing  contentious roosts under various conditions, and can serve as effective  mechanisms for both reducing conflict and educating the public about the  conservation and management challenges that face <em>P. poliocephalus</em>.  Government subsidies in New South Wales have enabled commercial  orchardists to install full exclusion netting to protect their crops  from flying fox damage in advance of a halt to licenced culling on  crops. The New South Wales government has also initiated a program that  funds restoration of both roosting and foraging habitat.",Australasian,,false,false,Global

But there are subspecies&#160;that are in danger of becoming extinct e.g.&#160;<em>Odocoileus hemionus cerrosensis</em>&#160;because on the island where it occurs, density is very low, because there are feral dogs and predation is high.<br/><br/>One obstacle involved in evaluating mule deer populations trend is inconsistent and incomplete data collections as stated by Carpenter <em>et al.</em> (2003). This problem results from the wide variety of methodologies and approaches used by states and provinces for Mule Deer management. There is a real need to standardize many of the methodologies to obtain data collections and establish protocols to obtain those measurements about Mule Deer populations.","Mule Deer are well adapted to a variety of habitats including temperate forest, desert and semidesert, open range, grassland, field and scrub habitats as well as Mountainous areas.","Today the most urgent threat to Mule Deer in the wild is the spread of Chronic Wasting Disease (CWD) a transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE). Currently CWD is more prominent at the local or regional level. CWD has currently been diagnosed in Mule Deer in the Rocky Mountains region of the United States and other mid-western states. Other threats include: high predator populations (including feral dogs), competition with livestock grazing, human habitat alterations and other anthropogenic forces. Although most of the subspecies are not threatened, the Cedro Island subspecies (<em>Odocoileus hemionus cerrocensis</em>) is considered to be Vulnerable (IUCN 1988) because of the low numbers and the high predation by feral dogs and poaching.","Where they occur Mule Deer populations are typically managed by federal, state and provincial agencies that monitor abundance and trends in order to set species management objectives. As a result Mule Deer remain abundant throughout much of their native range and are not currently in urgent need of further conservation action, but some evidence in the United State and Canada has shown declines in some populations (Bellard <em>et al</em>. 2001). Additionally in Mexico some data show local extinction of some populations in the Chihuahuan desert region of Coahuila and Nuevo León Mexico (Martínez-Muñoz <em>et al</em>. 2002), and in some populations we found evidence of metapopulation dynamics for this specie (Sanchez- Rojas and Gallina 2000).",Stable,"<em>Odocoileus hemionus</em> occurs throughout western North America from Alaska and Western Canada through the Rocky Mountains and Western Plains States of the United States south to the Peninsula of Baja California, Cedro Island, Tiburon Island and Northwestern Mexico.

In some portions of the range the species has been increasing for almost a century (especially where large predators have been extirpated) while in other areas populations are small and in decline.","White-tailed Deer inhabit a wide range of habitats from north temperate to subtropical and semi-arid environments in North America, and include rainforests and other equatorial associations, as deciduous forests and savannas of Central America and Northern South America (Brokx 1984, Danields 1991, Smith 1991). It is abundant in mixed pine-oak forests of Mexico (Ffolliott and Gallina 1981), and in second-growth forests and thickets and forest-savanna ecotones of Guatemala, Honduras, Belize, El Salvador, Costa Rica and Panama (Mendez 1984). Ecological limitations in northern or montane habitats are related to depth, quality and duration of snow (Blouch 1984) and in more southern latitudes and lower elevations, the amount and temporal distribution of precipitation (Ffolliott and Gallina 1981, Mendez 1984, Villarreal 1999). <em>O. virginianus</em> favour more mesic climates and vegetation within arid regions. In the Andes countries, distribution of the White-tailed Deer is not limited by elevation but rather by steep arid habitat and by rainforest on the mountain slopes (Brokx 1984). White-tailed Deer is an extremely adaptable species (see compilation of 500 deer studies in Mexico by Mandujano 2004). The species thrives in close association with man and his agricultural and industrial pursuits. Its requirements are met in practically every ecological type including grasslands, prairies and plains, mountains, hardwoods, coniferous and tropical forests, deserts, and even in woodlots associated with farmland. In the United States, it reaches its largest densities in hardwood forests and bushlands (Teer 1991).<br/><br/>White-tailed Deer occupy a well defined home range, but they are not territorial. Home range are influenced by age, sex, density, social interactions, latitude, season and habitat characteristics. Size of home ranges varies inversely with density and vegetative cover. Annual home range averages 59- 520 ha (Marchinton and Hirth 1984). In northeastern Mexico, <em>O. v. texanus</em> home range averages 193 ha for females, and 234 ha for males in a xerophyllous brushland (Bello <em><em>et al.&#160;</em></em>2004), and <em>O. v. sinaloae</em> in a tropical dry forest in the Pacific Coast of Mexico had a home range of 34 ha during the wet season (Sánchez Rojas <em><em>et al.</em></em>1994).<br/><br/>The White-tailed Deer is a polytypic species that has become well adapted to different environments. This diversity is reflected in body weight, external dimensions, coat coloration, antler growth and, no doubt assorted physiological, biochemical and behavioural distinctions. In general, the colour is darker in the humid, forested areas, and paler in the drier, more open brushland, reddish in subtropical and tropical environments (Backer 1984). In the northern hemisphere undergo two complete molts per year and exhibit seasonal variation in pelage. The summer coat consists of short, thin, wiry hairs and varies from red-brown to bright tan; the winter coat varies from blue-grey to grey-brown and has longer, thicker and more brittle hairs (Smith 1991). High Andean populations may retain a greyish pelage year-round, while tropical whitetails may keep the tawny, reddish phase (Baker 1984). Adults have a white nose band, orbital region and throat patch. All underparts including lower tail, insides of legs, venter, and chin are white. Fawns have a reddish-brown with white dorsal spots that disappear at 3-4 months of age (Hesselton and Hesselton 1982).",These threats are only considered for the subspecies of Central and South America: feral dogs may be a nuisance to deer in some areas (Causey and Cude 1980). Some populations in Venezuela are threatened by overhunting and habitat loss (Moscarella <em><em>et al.</em></em> 2003). Poaching is the other cause of local population extinction.,"Historically probably not as abundant as at the present time in northern populations. Range has expanded northward farther into Canada as a result of habitat changes caused by humans. White-tailed Deer population estimated in the United States must be over 11,000,000 of which a third will be in the State of Texas. In Canada the estimation is a half of million deer (Whitehead 1993). Deer herds in Canada and mainly in the United states are overabundant, but in Mexico, Central America and South America most of the populations are declining, and most of the subspecies status are unknown.",Stable,"This species occurs from southern Canada south through most of the U.S. and Mexico to South America (Peru, Ecuador, Bolivia, Colombia, northern Brazil, Venezuela, and the Guianas).

In some states this species is of conservation concern but in others it is quite secure.","This species has a strong affinity for tall grass and mid-grass prairies. It also uses riparian areas (marsh edges), forest-field edges, fields, hedgerows, and unmowed strips along railroad rights-of-way and roadsides. It generally avoids short grass habitats. Nests are in underground burrows. It is primarily diurnal, but less conspicuous than other ground squirrels. Less than 10% of its time is spent above ground (Sowls 1948). It begins hibernation by late September.<br/><br/>It is not colonial, but lives in loose colonies. Densities of 10-20/ha have been recorded (Banfield 1974). Populations appear cyclic and peak every 4-6 years. During peak years it may occur in densities of 30/acre (74/ha) (Schwartz and Schwartz 1981). In central South Dakota, the annual home range was 25 ha for males, 9 ha for females (Choromanski-Norris <em>et al.</em> 1989). <br/><br/>The breeding period is immediately after hibernation in early spring. Gestation lasts 28 days, with young being born in May or June. Litter size is 5-11 (average 7); with one litter per year. Young are weaned in 40 days.<br/><br/>Although prairie habitats may be stable or increasing, other Franklin’s Ground Squirrel habitats may be declining. The availability of suitable cover and soil structure for burrows contribute to limiting their distribution. Burrows must be deep to be insulated from heat and cold, and must be well drained. This species seems to prefer to burrow in embankments (river and ditch banks) (Kennicott 1855) or berms (highway and railroad rights-of-way) (Ellis 1982). This may be because: there is better drainage;&#160;embankments and berms often consist of less tightly packed soil, allowing easier digging; or&#160;tunnels need to be shorter. <br/><br/>Elevated railroad right-of-way beds seem to provide acceptable habitats, as well as dispersal corridors. In fact, in states for which data exist, populations of <em>S. franklinii</em> have become largely restricted to railroad rights-of-way, and to some lesser extent prairie fragments. Ellis (1982) points out that such rights-of-way usually have a diversity of dicotyledonous plants and a mixture of weedy and native species. Occasionally populations are also found in road rights-of-way, prairie cemeteries, forest/grassland edges, fencerows, and fallow fields and pastures. While prairies are no longer declining dramatically in acreage, railroad right-of-way habitats are being lost to changing management techniques and abandonment. Encroachment by woody vegetation on abandoned rights-of-way may provide less suitable conditions for <em>S. franklinii</em>. It requires adequate vegetative cover, and are not found in areas with short grasses resulting from frequent mowing (more than once a year) or herbicide treatments (Benjamin 1991, Lewis and Rongstad 1992, Hofmann 1999). It is possible that right-of-ways are more often mowed or treated with herbicide by railroad maintenance crews than in the past.","Threats in decreasing order of severity are: loss and fragmentation of primary habitat, all- and midgrass prairie; extermination by man as a supposed agricultural pest and acknowledged predator of duck eggs; frequent mowing and herbicide of railroad rights-of-way; loss of railroad rights-of-way to other uses.<br/><br/>The historical distribution of <em>S. franklinii</em> is from Kansas, Missouri, and Illinois northward to Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba, coinciding with former mid- and tallgrass prairie habitats. Such habitats have been greatly reduced, with 82.6–99.9% declines in the extent of tallgrass prairies in 12 states and one Canadian province since European settlement (Bowles <em>et al</em>. 1998). Prairie mammals, such as the Prairie Deer Mouse (<em>Peromyscus maniculatus bairdii</em>), Prairie Vole (<em>Microtus ochrogaster</em>), and Franklin’s Ground Squirrel have suffered as a result (Bowles <em>et al</em>. 1998, Pergams and Nyberg 2001).<br/><br/>In the eastern part of its range, <em>S. franklinii</em> is found primarily in small linear habitats. The continuing decline could be the result of the difficulty of dispersing individuals finding a suitable unoccupied habitat.  It is known that male juveniles disperse (Ellis 1982, Benjamin 1991), but it is unknown for what distance. Perhaps juvenile mortality has increased so much (automobiles and trains are obvious potential sources) that they rarely find suitable habitats during dispersal.<br/><br/>Population fragmentation and isolation may also have longer-term effects through declines in vigour due to loss of genetic variability. Occupation of small, isolated habitat patches, as is the case in the USA, may hamper successful dispersal and promote inbreeding. It seems to be faring appreciably better in Canada (perhaps suitable habitat patches are larger and less isolated), although Canadian populations are also apparently declining. Habitat changes in Canada may be less detrimental. For example, in Canada, fire suppression has resulted in the succession of prairie to aspen parkland, where <em>S. franklinii</em> continues to be found. Although the habitat has changed, large contiguous tracts have been preserved, whereas in the USA only smaller prairie fragments and rights-of-way continue to provide habitat for <em>S. franklinii</em>.<br/><br/>It opportunistically eats the seeds, fruits, and foliage of a great variety of plants, but vegetation probably does not comprise the majority of its diet. It has been thought to be an agricultural pest, and has at times been systematically exterminated. Millions of <em>S. franklinii</em> were killed for bounties ranging 1–10¢ per skin in the late 1800s (Bailey 1893). However, there is little evidence that they cause much crop damage. <em>Spermophilus franklinii</em> may be the least herbivorous of the ground squirrels, eating as much or more insect and other animal matter as vegetation (Bailey 1893, Ellis 1982, Hofmann 1999). There is, in fact, some evidence that they avoid row crops, and are only occasionally found in cover crops (Benjamin 1991). On the other hand, there is good evidence that <em>S. franklinii</em> opportunistically preys on waterfowl eggs, and there has been some extermination of the species for that reason (Sowls 1948, Balser <em>et al</em>.1968, Lynch 1972).<br/><br/>""Poison peanuts"" (pelleted peanuts and zinc phosphide) are often ploughed into the ground by highway departments to control plains pocket gophers (<em>Geomys bursarius</em>); this probably affects <em>S. franklinii</em> in areas with both species. Pesticide use has played, and may still play, a role in the decline of this species. Scott <em>et al</em>. (1959) describe ""virtually annihilative losses"" of <em>S. franklinii</em> in areas treated with dieldrin, a pesticide banned in 1974. Deleterious effects from other pesticides still in use are possible.<br/><br/>Internal parasites known to infest <em>S. franklinii</em> are the protozoans <em>Eimeria franklinii</em> and <em>Trypanosoma hixsoni</em>, the cestode <em>Hymenolepsis diminuta</em>, and the nematodes <em>Capillaria chandleri</em>, <em>Citellinema bifurcatum</em>, <em>Physaloptera masino</em>, <em>Rictularia citelli</em>, and <em>Weinlandia citelli</em> (Jackson 1961, p. 142).","It is thought to be very rare in Illinois, Indiana, Wisconsin, Ontario, Kansas, Iowa, and Missouri; scarce in Nebraska, Minnesota, South Dakota, and North Dakota; and relatively common in Alberta, Manitoba, and Saskatchewan. In most of the United States the <em>S. franklinii</em> population is highly fragmented into small, often linear habitats. In much of Canada, even though fire suppression has resulted in the succession of prairie to aspen parkland, large contiguous tracts have been preserved, and <em>S. franklinii</em> seems to be faring better.<br/><br/>However, in view of extensive loss of prairie habitats, together with available data that document declines in both area of occupancy and extent of occurrence, it is likely that <em>S. franklinii</em> has declined to the level of rarity in the USA. On the other hand, while there has been some additional loss of prairies in the last 10 years, it is probable that in recent years more acres of prairie have been restored than have been lost. In addition, <em>S. franklinii</em> is not exclusively associated with prairie vegetation. Under these circumstances, it is unclear why populations of <em>S. franklinii</em> are still declining.",Decreasing,"This species occurs in the United States and Canada: from Kansas, Missouri, and Illinois northward to Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba. This includes parts of North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, Indiana, Wisconsin, Minnesota, and Ontario; and all of Iowa. Eastern (Illinois, Indiana, Wisconsin, Ontario) and southern (Kansas, Missouri) parts of its range seem to be shrinking rapidly with few populations (often estimated to be less than 10 per state or province) known to remain extant.

However, many of the S4 (Apparently Secure) and S5 (Secure) rankings seem to be based on insubstantial data. Some exceptions are Alberta, Manitoba, and Saskatchewan, where populations still seem to be relatively common. <em>Spermophilus franklinii</em> is unranked in Minnesota and North Dakota. There are no individuals of <em>S. franklinii</em> in captivity listed in the International Species Information System database (ISIS 2003).<br/><br/>There have been at least two introductions of <em>S. franklinii</em>, both in Illinois and both were failures.

(2002), no squirrels were caught. The second attempt (Panzer and Schipp 1986) may have failed because of lack of dispersal possibilities from a small, urban site (Martin <em>et al</em>. 2002).<br/><br/>Recent literature and conversations indicate populations of <em>S. franklinii</em> exist in the following protected areas.

Litter size varies  regionally, with an annual mean of 2.87 in Oregon, 3.50 in north and  central California, and 4.00 in west-central California (Chapman 1974).  Fecundity of the Brush Rabbit is lower than other <em>Sylvilagus </em>species,  producing about 15 young annually (Chapman 1974). Gestation time is  approximately 27 days (Cervantes <em>et al.</em> 2005).<br/><br/>The  subspecies <em>S. b. riparius</em> occupies both old-growth riparian forest,  dominated by Valley Oak (<em>Quercus lobata</em>) and riparian communities  dominated by thickets of willows (<em>Salix </em>spp.), wild roses (<em>Rosa </em>spp.),  blackberries (<em>Rubus </em>spp.), and other successional trees and shrubs and  when available dense tall stands of herbaceous plants adjacent to  patches of riparian shrubs in the northern San Joaquin Valley,  California. <em>S. b. riparius</em> stays close to dense stands of vegetation  into which it retreats for escape, resting and nesting. They do not  normally burrow or use burrows (Williams and Basey 1986, Williams 1988,  Williams and Hamilton 2002). <em>S. b. riparius</em> eats a great variety of  woody and herbaceous plants, preferring green foliage of shrubs, grasses  and forbs. Much of its foraging is concentrated at the edge between  thickets of woody plants and more open ground with herbaceous plants. A  favored habitat is willow thickets along stream banks (Orr 1940, Chapman  1974, Kelt <em>et al.</em> 2014).<br/><br/>The area of highest abundance of  the Cedros Island Brush Rabbit, <em>S. b. cerrosensis</em> is characterized by  xeric scrubland vegetation with dominance of chamizo (<em>Atriplex </em>spp.), in  association with sacrocaule and coastal desert scrub in the southwest  part of the island composed by Limberbush (<em>Jatropha</em> <em>cuneata</em>), Oregano  (<em>Lippia palmeri</em>), Fourwing Saltbush (<em>Atriplex canescens</em>), agaves (<em>Agave  shawii</em>, <em>A. sebastiana</em>) and other shrubs (Lorenzo <em>et al.</em> 2014, Lorenzo-Monterrubio <em>et al.</em>  2018). <em>S. b. cerrosensis</em> shares its habitat with other endemic mammals,  such as the San Diego Pocket Mouse (<em>Chaetodipus</em> <em>fallax anthonyi</em>),  Bryant’s Woodrat (<em>Neotoma bryanti bryanti</em>), the Cedros Island Cactus  Mouse (<em>Peromyscus fraterculus cedrosensis</em>), and Cedros Island Mule Deer  (<em>Odocoileus hemionus cerrosensis</em>) (Lorenzo <em>et al.</em> 2014, Lorenzo-Monterrubio <em>et al.</em> 2018). <br/><br/>All  the records of <em>S. bachmani</em> south of 30°N, not including the insular  population (Cedros Island) are associated with mesic vegetation  habitats, some of which are oases (Cervantes <em>et al.</em> 1999, Lorenzo <em>et al.</em> 2013).","Hunting for food and the clearing of land for human settlements pose a  threat to Brush Rabbits, but the extent and severity are not quantified  (but see select Mexican subspecies below).<br/><br/>Decline in numbers and  threats of extinction of subspecies <em>S. b. riparius</em> stem principally  from actions involved in developments of irrigated agriculture in the  San Joaquin Valley of California. Foremost of these developments were  stream impoundment, channelization of streams on the valley floor and  the San Joaquin River Delta, and clearing and cultivation of natural  communities. Riparian communities in the San Joaquin Valley have been  reduced to about 1% of their historical extent, are found almost  entirely within the levees of channelized streams. Most existing patches  have been extensively degraded by wood cutting, livestock, invasion of  exotic species, greater levels of flooding within levees, and lack of  natural riverine processes (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 1998, U.S.  Fish and Wildlife Service 2000).<br/><br/>Principal existing threats to <em>S.  b. riparius</em> can be summarized in order of importance as: 1) stochastic  environmental processes, wildfire and flood; 2) additional habitat loss  and degradation due to urbanization and conversion to agriculture; 3)  increased predation from domestic and feral cats and dogs due to urban  development adjacent to existing inhabited sites; and 4) genetic and  demographic stochasticity in small populations. While all of these are  proximate threats, wildfire and flood are probably the most severe  threats to the population at Caswell MSP. A less imminent threat is  natural successional processes that are reducing habitat quality.  Because the park has multiuse objectives, and because up-stream  impoundments have greatly modified the natural flooding regime,  secondary successional patches, especially those caused by scouring  floods, are disappearing from the Park. The changes are noticeable and  may be associated with the decline in <em>S. b. riparius</em> within the park  (Williams and Hamilton 2002).<br/><br/>For the South Delta metapopulation  of <em>S. b. riparius</em>, wildfire is a serious threat to each subpopulation,  but would unlikely affect all subpopulations simultaneously. Flooding  poses a more immediate metapopulation threat, because the entire area is  approximately at sea level or below, rivers are channelized, and there  are few or no refugia above flood level. Over the past several decades  there have been numerous breaks in levees and widespread flooding. The  most recent were in 1997, 2006, and 2011. Typically, the only areas not  flooded are built-up areas for railroads, levee tops, multilane highways  and other developed sites. Likely these areas will be inundated at some  time in the future when flooding is greater than it has been in recent  decades. Urbanization also is viewed as an imminent threat because most  of the known populations are adjacent to areas undergoing development  planning, with construction slated to begin within 1-10 years. However,  this threat may be mitigated by appropriate design and management of  conservation lands set aside for Brush Rabbits and other organisms  (Williams and Hamilton 2002).<br/><br/>The re-introduced population on the  San Joaquin River NWR, like the populations at Caswell MSP and South  Delta, is threatened by wildfire and flood, but major conservation  actions to mitigate impacts of the flooding have been implemented at the  refuge. See below.<br/><br/><em>S. b. cerrosensis</em> from Cedros Island, off the  west coast of Baja California Sur is under intense pressure from  predation by feral dogs (Cortes-Calva <em>et al.</em> 2013,  Álvarez-Castañeda and Lorenzo 2016). On Cedros Island there is a  population of 2,696 inhabitants, whose main activity is obtaining salt  from the salt flats of Guerrero Negro (INEGI 2010). There are vast areas  covered with organic (lobster shells) and inorganic (glass bottles,  metal material) garbage. Additionally, feral cats (<em>Felis sylvestris</em>) and  feral dogs (<em>Canis lupus</em>) in large numbers occupy also the habitat where  <em>S. b. cerrosensis</em> occurs. <em>S. b. cerrosensis</em> was abundant about 20 years  ago, however poaching has been excessive and reduced the rabbit  population to a situation that is currently critical (Lorenzo <em>et al.</em> 2014).<br/><br/><em>S.  b. peninsularis</em> may be extinct or close to extinct due to anthropogenic  activities – the widespread building of infrastructure to support a  growing tourist industry, using all the water of the river for the urban  development, creating more desert areas in which the Desert Cottontail  (<em>Sylvilagus audubonii</em>) is more common (Lorenzo <em>et al.</em> 2013).<br/><br/><em>S.  b. exiguus</em> from the central desert of the Baja California peninsula has  always been rare and now may be declining due the process of  desertification in the peninsula, in which the mesic environment has  been more optimal for desert species such as the Desert Cottontail and  Black-tailed Jackrabbit (<em>Lepus californicus</em>).","Except for the Riparian Brush Rabbit (subspecies <em>riparius</em>) which is  state (California) and federally listed as endangered (Williams <em>et al.</em>  2004), and the forms <em>S. b. cerrosensis</em> on Cedros Island, and <em>S. b.  exiguus</em> and <em>S. b. peninsularis </em>on the Baja California peninsula, the  Brush Rabbit is considered common where it is known to exist, throughout  Oregon, California, and Baja California (Chapman and Ceballos 1990,  Kelly 2018a).<br/><br/>The <em>S. b. riparius</em> population at Caswell Memorial  State Park in San Joaquin County, California, USA, was statistically  estimated in 1993, when there were 241 rabbits (approximate 95%  confidence interval = 170-608) (Williams 1993). Similar censuses were  conducted in 1997-2004, resulting in capture of 0 (1997) to 16 (2002)  rabbits. Capture rates in the best year (2002) were only 27% of that of  1993, and captures and recaptures were too few in any one year since  1993 to use capture-recapture population models to meaningfully estimate  population size (Williams <em>et al.</em> 2004).<br/><br/>Population  censuses for the <em>S. b. riparius</em> South Delta metapopulation have not been  conducted because of restrictions on activities on private land.  However, capture rates for short-term assessments of presence and to  capture breeders for a controlled propagation program suggested that  this metapopulation have remained at fairly high densities since its  discovery in 1998. Capture rates for the South Delta metapopulation  varied from 127% to 626% of the capture rate of the Caswell MSP  population in 1993. The South Delta population probably consists of  about 300-600 rabbits at peaks in population cycles).<br/><br/>Censuses  have also not been conducted for the re-introduced population of <em>S. b.  riparius</em> on the San Joaquin River National Wildlife Refuge. However,  visual and camera surveys suggest that the population is quite robust  and now reaches into the thousands when conditions are optimal—due to  the quality and quantity of available habitat.<br/><br/>In 2012 the  population density of <em>S. b. cerrosensis</em> was estimated to be 1.21  individuals/km² and the number of individuals estimated as 145 in an  area of 120.7 km² (Lorenzo <em>et al.</em> 2014).",Stable,"The Brush Rabbit is distributed along the Pacific coast of North  America. It reaches the Columbia River in the north (Oregon-Washington  border) and in the south it extends to the southern tip of Baja  California. It extends east from the Pacific Ocean to the western Sierra  Nevada mountain range (Chapman 1974, Kelly 2018). It occupies an  elevational range of 0-2,070 m (Chapman 1974).<br/><br/>The subspecies <em>S.  b. riparius</em> occurs only in Caswell Memorial State Park (MSP) on the  Stanislaus River, and the South Delta area of the San Joaquin River,  including Paradise Cut and Tom Paine Slough. The park size is 253 acres,  and population on the South Delta occurs on privately owned land  (Williams and Hamilton 2002). Even though there is other ideal habitat  for <em>S. b. riparius</em> in MSP, they are unable to reach it because there is  no connecting habitat above flood level in MSP (Sandoval, Williams, and  Colliver 2006).<br/><br/>In Caswell Memorial State Park, Stanislaus River,  San Joaquin County, California, USA,<em> S. b. riparius</em> occurs in about 90%  of the park's 102 ha when populations are high, but about 20-40% of the  Park at other times (Williams 1988, 1993).<br/><br/>The South Delta  population of<em> S. b. riparius</em>, in the vicinity of Mossdale and Lathrop,  San Joaquin County, CA, USA, exists on about 122 ha of private land  within an area of about 2,927 ha. Populations are found along Paradise  Cut, Tom Paine Slough, Grantline Canal, and the San Joaquin River.  Rabbits also are found along the narrow right-of-ways of two railroads  running through the area. Habitat for <em>S. b. riparius</em> is distributed in  discontinuous, narrow strands of riparian vegetation along streams,  sloughs, and railroad beds adjacent to intensely cultivated fields. Most  land in this area is planned for urban and industrial development  within the next 1-10 years. Existing habitat is periodically cut or  burned for weed and flood control (Williams and Hamilton 2002).<br/><br/>The  re-introduced population of <em>S. b. riparius</em> is located in the San  Joaquin River National Wildlife Refuge in Stanislaus County, California.  This refuge has about 285 ha of habitat for Brush Rabbits. An  additional few hundred hectares have been restored from cropland to  natural, riparian vegetation. Refugia from flooding, vegetated mounds  and berms, have also been established throughout the refuge for rabbits  and other terrestrial wildlife (Kelly 2018a, b).<br/><br/>The former range  of <em>S. b. peninsularis</em> was from the Magdalena Bay region to the tip of  the Baja California peninsula, although specimens are known only from  two localities, Santa Anita and Cabo San Lucas separated by only 32 km.  Recent intensive field work failed to locate any of the rabbits, and the  area has been severely modified by tourist developments. The last known  specimens of this subspecies were obtained only in the first quarter of  the 20th century (Lorenzo <em>et al.</em> 2013).<br/><br/>The range of <em>S.  b. exiguus</em> is in the central desert of the Baja California peninsula,  where it is known from only eight localities. While recent intensive  surveys have found desert cottontail rabbits to be common, no Brush  Rabbits were observed at these sites. While the region only exhibits low  human impact, it nevertheless appears that the exiguus subspecies is of  conservation concern (Lorenzo <em>et al.</em> 2013).<br/><br/><em>S. b.  cerrosensis</em> is restricted to lowlands of Cedros Island, Baja California  on the Pacific-north coast of Mexico. Cedros Island is a “mountain in  the sea” so less than the 15% of the island is optimal habitat for <em>S. b.  cerrosensis</em>, in addition with the presence of packs of feral dogs that  in recent years have been controlled.","This species is hunted for food and sport. &lt;2-5% of the total  population is utilized, because their brushy preferred habitat is  unsuitable for hunting.",Terrestrial,"There are no known conservation measures in place for the species as a whole.<br/><br/>The  San Joaquin Valley population of subspecies <em>S. b. riparius </em>has been  listed by the state of California as an endangered species (U. S. Fish  and Wildlife Service 2000), and has been the subject of a recovery plan  involving habitat management and captive breeding (U.S. Fish and  Wildlife Service 1998, Kelly 2018b).<br/><br/>The following timeline includes recent conservation measures implemented for <em>S. b. riparius</em>:<br/>1) Distribution and status review in 1986 (Williams and Basey 1986).<br/>2) Listing as a California Species of Special Concern (Williams and Basey 1986).<br/>3) Ecology and habitat management plan for Caswell Memorial State Park developed (Williams 1988).<br/>4) Populations estimate made for Caswell MSP in 1993, the only known population at the time (Williams 1993).<br/>5) Listed as an endangered species by the State of California in 1994 (State of California 1994).<br/>6)  Featured species in the multi-species Recovery Plan for Upland Species  of the San Joaquin Valley, California (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service  1998).<br/>7) Habitat management plan focused on wildfire and flooding developed (Close and Williams 1998).<br/>8) Listed as a USA endangered species by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in 2002 (Williams <em>et al.</em> 2004).<br/>9)  Controlled Propagation and Reintroduction Plan for Riparian Brush  Rabbits developed for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Williams and  Hamilton 2002).<br/>10) Habitat acquisition and restoration begun by  multi-agency CalFed Program with U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service as the  land owner and manager, starting in 2000 and continuing to date  (Williams <em>et al.</em> 2004).<br/>11) Controlled propagation facility constructed beginning in 2001 and completed in 2002 by U.S. Bureau of Reclamation (Williams <em>et al.</em> 2004).<br/>12)  Controlled propagation of Riparian Brush Rabbits initiated in December  2001 with 3 males and 3 females in one large outdoor pen that contained  semi-natural habitat conditions (Williams <em>et al.</em> 2004).<br/>13)  The re-introduced population of Riparian Brush Rabbits on the San  Joaquin River NWR was started with the release of 49 young rabbits from  the controlled propagation facility between July and October 2002  (Williams <em>et al.</em> 2004).<br/>14) By the end of 2002, controlled  propagation expanded to three breeding pens resulting in larger numbers  of rabbits being released on the refuge, many fitted with radio-collars  to get detailed information on survivorship, dispersal, and habitat use  (Williams <em>et al.</em> 2008, Hamilton <em>et al.</em> 2010, Kelt <em>et al.</em> 2014).<br/>15)  Major spring flooding of the San Joaquin River in 2006 resulted in the  mortality of nearly all Brush Rabbits on the refuge. The extent and  severity of flooding was mapped so that locations could be chosen for  the placement of large mounds of dirt that would be vegetated with  brushy species and thereby serve as temporary refuges for rabbits during  floods. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service also vegetated miles of bare  river levees on the refuge with brushy species to provide additional  upland cover for the rabbits (Kelly 2018b).<br/>16) Major spring flooding  of the San Joaquin River occurred again in 2011 and 2017, but because  of the habitat management restoration measures taken following the 2006  flood, the population rebounded quickly in both years and despite high  levels of flood-related mortality (Kelly 2018b).<br/>17) In late 2005 and  early 2006, rabbits were also released on the privately owned Faith  Ranch, which is under conservation easement, and runs downriver along  the San Joaquin River from the refuge boundary towards Caswell MSP.  Later in 2006, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service acquired the  Buffington property, which connects the Faith Ranch to Caswell MSP,  thereby creating more than 20 continuous river-miles of riparian habitat  for the Brush Rabbit (Kelly 2018b).<br/>18) By the time the breeding and  reintroduction program was suspended in December 2013, a total of 1,496  Riparian Brush Rabbits had been released on the refuge, that includes  releases on the Faith Ranch and the Buffington property (Kelly 2018b).<br/>19) The rabbit populations at Caswell MSP and on the San Joaquin River NWR continue to be monitored (Kelly 2018b).<br/><br/>Although  <em>S. b. cerrosensis</em> is fully protected on Cedros Island, along with all  native wildlife (SEMARNAT 2010), there is an urgent need to assess the  pressures of habitat destruction and poaching on this subspecies. Cedros  Island needs to correct its management of open industrial garbage dumps  and to eradicate feral cats and dogs as soon as possible. The control  of feral dogs began at the end of 1980 by personnel of the National  Institute of Ecology in collaboration with local fishermen (McChesney  and Tershy 1998), but the dogs were not eradicated because the effort  was not constant. It is necessary to document the impact of exotic  species of native fauna of Cedros Island. It is necessary to develop  research projects to determine population dynamics, reproduction,  ethology and other aspects of the biology and ecology of this subspecies  (Lorenzo <em>et al.</em> 2014, Lorenzo-Monterrubio <em>et al.</em> 2018).<br/><br/><em>S.  b. cerrosensis</em> is an endangered subspecies according to the Official  Norm NOM-059 of Mexico (SEMARNAT 2010). This subspecies has drastically  declined because of habitat modification. The effort made to evaluate  the status of this subspecies has been sufficient to consider it  extinct.<br/><br/><em>S. b. exiguus</em> is threatened. All these subspecies should  be added to national and international lists of protected species  (Lorenzo <em>et al.</em> 2013).",Nearctic|Neotropical,,false,false,Global

Dogs and cats do not seem to bother this species due to its potential to excrete a nauseating chemical from its anal glands (Widmann and Widmann 2004). The diet comprises largely worms and soil arthropods, so this species is perhaps more common in areas with soft soil for foraging; grasslands typically have extensive root systems which make digging difficult, and it is seen along small streams during the dry season (Widmann and Widmann 2004).","Palawan Stink-badger is rarely hunted reflecting its ability to excrete a pungent smell when attacked; for this reason, most domestic dogs and cats give it a wide berth (Widmann and Widmann 2004). Some hunting by ethnic Pala'wan occurs, but not at levels threatening to the population.&#160;Although it probably has not suffered from conversion of primary forest&#160;to secondary forest or even to shrubland, intensification of grassland or permanent agriculture might perhaps pose a threat to this species perhaps particular where hedges&#160;and other uncultivated strips are lost (Widmann and Widmann 2004).&#160;Ongoing development of large-scale plantations (oil palm, rubber) on Palawan may increasingly cause habitat loss&#160;(P.

The species is found in a wide variety of open, edge, degraded and anthropogenic habitats; much of its range was until recently closed evergreen forest inimical to the species on the mainland, although occupied in Java. Records of the species from agricultural and peri-urban areas in Lao PDR, where hunting of wildlife has been very intense, indicate a high resilience to persecution, albeit probably at reduced density where such pressures are very high.","Javan Mongoose altitudinal distribution differs between mainland South-east Asia and Java; on Sumatra it is unknown. On Java the species has been camera-trapped from almost sea-level up to 1,800 m (A. Ario pers. comm. 2014). On the mainland the highest record traced comes from only 870 m, from Thailand, with two others over 700 m in that country (Chutipong <em>et al</em>.&#160;2014). In Vietnam, Roberton (2007) traced records only up to 400 m. In Lao PDR, most records are from below 250 m, with one area (of plateau topography) at 520-530 m also holding the species (Duckworth <em>et al</em>. 2010). In peninsular Malaysia, all records known to Wells (1989) were from the plains. The few recent localities in&#160;Myanmar traced by Than Zaw&#160;<em>et al</em>. (2008)&#160;(for&#160;this species and/or&#160;<em>H. auropunctatus</em>) are also at plains level. Records from Cambodia are also mostly lowland with one outlying site, a marsh, at 560 m (Holden and Neang 2009, Gray <em>et al</em>. 2014, R. J. Timmins pers. comm. 2014). The aggregate survey effort, including out-of-formal-observation time, in mid altitudes across mainland South-east Asia is sufficiently high that it is quite clear that the wide altitudinal range in Java is not replicated on the mainland. Overall, on the mainland most records come from below 300 m with localised occurrence to 870 m, mostly in areas of anomalously gentle terrain.<br/><br/>Most records with accurate observer-assigned habitats come from degraded or anthropogenic habitats, although in Java the species is commonly encountered in closed forest, as well as in open habitats such as suburban gardens, degraded forest edge, and pine and <em>Agathis damara</em> production forests&#160;(A. Ario pers. comm. 2014). On the mainland, careful inspection of records that are from evergreen forest areas usually shows them to come from deforested exclaves, such as from settlement or cultivation rather than within the forest itself (Thailand: W. Chutipong pers. comm. 2014; Lao PDR; Duckworth&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2010). Across its range the species uses: plantations and other anthropogenic habitats with bushes around human residences (A. Ario pers. comm. 2014), including urban areas such as residential gardens in parts of Bogor (N. Brickle pers. comm. 2010) (Java); ""bamboo and other scrubland, rough plantations including young teak, <em>Imperata</em>&#160;grassland and paddy and sugar-cane fields"" (Wells 1989: 96; peninsular Malaysia); mostly disturbed and edge areas,&#160;including extensive farmland and suburban areas, but including little-encroached deciduous dipterocarp forest (especially or solely near surface water) and, once, several kilometers into little-encroached, closed canopy semi-evergreen forest (Duckworth&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2010;&#160;Lao PDR); and grassland, scrub, villages, rice paddies, pineapple plantations, secondary forest (including&#160;semi-evergreen), deciduous forest (Chutipong <em>et al</em>.&#160;2014; Thailand). Agricultural habitats are particularly prevalent in videos of hunting of this species available in Thai on You-tube (W. Chutipong pers. comm. 2014). Whilst there are a fair number of records in non-Sundaic South-east Asia from little encroached deciduous forest (e.g., Duckworth&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2010), occupation of such habitats is far from universal in Cambodia and Thailand (Chutipong <em>et al</em>. 2014, R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2014); the species seems perhaps only to occur near permanent surface water. Despite the near-absence of records from interior closed evergreen forest in the mainland, the species freely uses opened-up areas in evergreen biomes (e.g., Duckworth&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2010, Chutipong&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014).&#160;The species also uses artificial banana-dominated embankments that border active seasonally inundated <em>Melaleuca </em>plantations (D.H.A. Willcox pers. comm. 2014).<br/><br/>This species is ground-dwelling, almost solely diurnal and usually observed singly or, occasionally, as duos (e.g. Duckworth&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2010). Other aspects of natural history are poorly known, given that much information published under the name '<em>Herpestes javanicus</em>' refers to <em>H. aurropunctatus</em>, not to <em>H.&#160;</em><em>javanicus</em>&#160;as defined here. It is possible that its natural history has never been studied in the field.","There are presently no known significant threats to Javan Mongoose. Numbers are probably restrained in Lao PDR and Viet Nam by the very heavy hunting typical in areas used by people, but even so the species is still seen occasionally in the suburbs of big towns (Duckworth <em>et al</em>.&#160;2010). It is also hunted in the agricultural parts of Thailand with various videos of hunts available on You-tube (W. Chutipong pers. comm. 2014). The numbers traded in Medan, Sumatra (Shepherd <em>et al</em>. 2004), are large for the apparently small occupied area of the island, but the enormous markets for pets etc. in Java apparently trade rather few (Shepherd 2012). Habitat changes across the region are likely to have benefited the species strongly over the past century, with large-scale fragmentation, degradation and outright conversion of closed evergreen forest into habitats used by this species. Although the species has not been recorded from heavily urbanised areas (i.e. with no significant garden or parkland component) such habitats still comprise a negligible proportion of its range. The high overlap of its range with agriculture exposes it to the risk of chemical threats with the ever-changing variety of agrochemicals in use. In addition, whilst&#160;it is well recorded from unintensified agriculture and agriculture close to scrub and other (at least temporarily) uncultivated areas, its ability to use large landscapes dominated by intensified wet rice production is not well known (other than that it does occur in them). These cover large parts of Java, Thailand and Viet Nam, and increasing parts of Lao PDR, Cambodia, Myanmar, peninsular Malaysia and Sumatra.","Javan Mongoose's habitat use overlaps little with that of most wildlife survey and research. Thus, country reviews of recent small carnivore status have typically traced few&#160;Javan Mongoose&#160;records (e.g., Than Zaw <em>et al</em>. 2008, Duckworth <em>et al</em>. 2010, Chutipong&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;2014). Records from activities in anthropogenic habitats, such as birdwatching and, in some countries, suburban living&#160;show that&#160;the species is evidently common, at least in peninsular Malaysia, Java, Cambodia and Thailand&#160;(Wells 1989, N. Brickle&#160;pers. comm. 2010, Chutipong&#160;<em>et al</em>.&#160;2014, A. Ario pers. comm. 2014, R.J. Timmins pers. comm. 2014). Records in Lao PDR are rather scarce, presumably because of the very heavy wildlife persecution in most settled areas (Duckworth&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2010). The species's abundance in Viet Nam is not clear, although it can be seen regularly in some heavily modified habitats, e.g. around staff accommodation in the buffer zone of Cuc Phuong National Park (D.H.A. Willcox pers. comm. 2014).&#160;In Myanmar, where village harvest of small carnivores and other similar-sized mammals is typically much lower than in Lao PDR and Viet Nam, the species (and/or&#160;<em>H. auropunctatus</em>)&#160;is so common in places that it is trapped by conservation agencies as a pest (Su Su 2005). The status in Sumatra is not clear: it is typically perceived as an enigma (e.g., Jennings and Veron 2011, Holden and Meijaard 2012) but Shepherd <em>et al</em>. (2004) found that it was one of the most commonly traded species&#160;(and the second most commonly traded carnivore)&#160;in the pet markets of Medan, Sumatra; every dealer questioned said that the animals were wild-caught in Aceh (C. R. Shepherd pers. comm. 2014).&#160;<br/><br/>The population trend is not directly known for any part of the range. Broad-scale habitat trends and the species's observed habitat use indicate that the heavy deforestation of recent decades has created much new habitat. The effect of the rapid intensification of, in particular, wet rice agriculture is unknown. In Thailand triple-crop irrigated rice supports massive rodent pest densities, such that rodent harvest is itself a big business for farmers, with many sold at roadside stalls (W. Chutipong pers. comm. 2014), thereby providing a ready food supply for mongooses; the species certainly uses such habitat in Thailand (W. Chutipong pers. comm. 2014). Set against this, high agrochemical application might be problematic, particularly for predators, and the reduction of unkempt corners and edge, which might be expected to provide important cover, might make such agricultural land less suitable for the&#160;species. This type of farming is increasing widely across the species's range. in some areas, notably Viet Nam, hunting levels&#160;are too high for the species to be common in this sort of agriculture (D.H.A. Willcox pers. comm. 2014).",Unknown,"Javan Mongoose occurs from Java through Sumatra (perhaps only the northern fifth)&#160;and mainland South-east Asia to uncertain&#160;northern and western extents. Veron <em>et al</em>. (2006) proposed that these limits lie within China, Myanmar and perhaps Thailand. The long-standing treatment of this species as conspecific with <em>H. auropunctatus</em>&#160;(under the name&#160;Small Asian Mongoose&#160;<em>H. javanicus</em>) and a paucity of specimen or other evidence available for re-examination from China, Lao PDR, northern Thailand and Myanmar hampers confident assignment of range (see extended, detailed discussion in&#160;Veron&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2006). The many introduced populations of&#160;<em>H. javanicus</em>&#160;<em>sensu lato</em> around the world are all believed to be of&#160;<em>H. auropunctatus</em>, but further confirmation is desirable (Veron&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2006). <br/><br/>Across most of&#160;its range,&#160;Javan Mongoose is rather rarely recorded by conventional conservation-oriented surveys, reflecting the need for these surveys to focus on habitats of high conservation relevance (notably closed evergreen forest)&#160;and this species's limited occurrence in such habitats (see 'Habitats and ecology' section). This hinders clarification of the distribution within each&#160;range&#160;state. In Lao PDR the species (not confirmed not also to include&#160;<em>H. auropunctatus</em>)&#160;has been recorded only in the south and centre of the country, where plains are extensive; there seem to be no records from the northern third (where plains are limited) (that mapped for the far north in Veron <em>et al</em>. [2006] is an error for central Viet Nam; Duckworth&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2010). It is unclear whether the lack of records from northern Lao PDR reflects&#160;a natural absence from there, a hunting-induced extirpation (more likely to occur in areas, such as this, where suitable habitat occurs as small isolates and is heavily used by people) or the limited relevant search effort at low altitudes in this predominantly highland area (Duckworth <em>et al</em>. 2010). In Thailand, most of the recent records of this species (not confirmed not also to include&#160;<em>H. auropunctatus</em>)&#160;traced by Chutipong <em>et al</em>. (2014) came from the lowland south and centre of the country, with none from north of&#160;17°03'N;&#160;as with Lao PDR, northern Thailand is predominantly highland. However, there are at least a few records (apparently left open as to species by Veron&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2006) from further north in Thailand,&#160;such as one from&#160;Chiang Mai at 18°47’N, 98°59’E (Chasen 1935). Vietnamese records (of this species (not confirmed not also to include&#160;<em>H. auropunctatus</em>) traced by Roberton (2007) came from a wide spread of the country including the far north (which has&#160;large highland areas but a greater proportion than in northern Lao PDR or Thailand of lowlands); although there was none from the Mekong delta, there are subsequent records for the U Minh wetlands and it seems to be one of the more common small carnivores in the delta (D.H.A. Willcox pers. comm. 2014). In Myanmar, Than Zaw <em>et al</em>. (2008) traced no records from recent formal wildlife survey, but knew of occurrence&#160;(of this species and/or&#160;<em>H. auropunctatus</em>)&#160;in two peri-urban areas of Yangon; information from elsewhere in the country was too limited for the lack of other such records to suggest absence or&#160;scarcity there. There are recent records in Cambodia from the north-east and south-west (e.g. Holden and Neang 2009, Gray <em>et al</em>. 2014), and the north (Stung Treng province) and north-west (Preah Vihear province) (D.H.A. Willcox pers. comm. 2014).&#160;In peninsular Malaysia, Wells (1989) traced records from many localities west of the main mountain range, but not from the east; a later collation (Jennings and Veron 2011) also seems to have found none in this eastern region. In Indonesia, the species is widespread in Java (Jennings and Veron 2011, A. Ario pers. comm. 2014), but in Sumatra has only been recorded from the north (perhaps only the northernmost fifth) (Van Strien 1996, Jennings and Veron 2011, Holden and Meijaard 2012). The species occurs also on the Indonesian islands of Bali, Panaitan and Madura (Jennings and Veron 2011) but its distribution across them is poorly documented.<br/><br/>This species's&#160;distribution (relative to that of <em>H. auropunctatus</em>) in Myanmar and China (including Hong Kong SAR),&#160;is unclear&#160;(Veron&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2006).","There is a moderate level of trade in at least Viet Nam, Lao PDR, Sumatra and Java (Shepherd <em>et al</em>. 2004, Shepherd&#160;2012, Duckworth <em>et al</em>. 2010), but this is unlikely to be at levels detrimental to populations except perhaps in Sumatra.",Terrestrial,"Javan Mongoose is protected in some range states and occurs in some, perhaps many protected areas (probably only fairly marginally in most, given that they typically comprise natural landscapes with only limited anthropogenic modification).

45208503,41619,Herpestes vitticollis,Least Concern,,2016,2015-03-03 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"Stripe-necked Mongoose&#160;is listed as Least Concern because it is unlikely to approach any of the criteria thresholds even for Near Threatened (NT) listing. Although its distribution is not extensive it far exceeds the size for a distribution-based categorisation as NT. Although population size is unknown, implausibly low densities would be needed for&#160;a population-size-based categorisation as NT.&#160;Similarly,&#160;population&#160;trends are not known, but&#160;there is nothing to suggest declines - if occurring at all - at present approach those needed for NT. The obvious tolerance for highly modified habitats, widespread and frequent records from areas with heavy human use, and the general recent relatively low levels of habitat change and hunting of mammals in this size class in its range all suggest it would be unlikely to be in steep decline in recent decades.","Stripe-necked Mongoose has been recorded in deciduous and evergreen forest, open scrub and along watercourses (Webb-Peploe 1947, Van Rompaey and Jayakumar 2003). In deciduous forests it is usually found in swampy clearings, along watercourses, and in open scrub (Krishnan 1972). There are records from rice fields and in tea and Teak <em>Tectona grandis</em> plantations, and probably other planted habitats, but it is unclear whether it can persist in wholly agricultural landscapes, or such animals are transients from (semi) -natural habitats. In Valparai in the Anamalai Hills, the species is regularly seen in peri-urban lanes and gardens (Mudappa 2013, Mudappa and Ganesh 2014). In Sri Lanka, it is rarely sighted in disturbed areas or close to human settlements (Ratnayeke pers. comm. 2008), however, the species is adaptable and can tolerate relatively high disturbance.<br/><br/>Stripe-necked Mongoose is more common in the hills than in the lowlands, and has been found up to 2,200 m (Hill 1939, Van Rompaey and Jayakumar 2003, D. Mudappa pers. comm. 2014). It is diurnal and feeds on small mammals, birds, birds' eggs, reptiles, fish, insects, grubs, and roots (Van Rompaey and Jayakumar 2003). The typical litter size is two to three and an animal in captivity was recorded as living for nearly 13 years (Van Rompaey and Jayakumar 2003).","There are no major threats to the global Stripe-necked Mongoose&#160;population.&#160;At the local scale it is hunted for meat (eaten by several tribes) and for its hair (used for making shaving brushes, paint brushes and good luck charms; Hanfee and Ahmed 1999). It is also regularly killed by hunting dogs (Adams 1931, Webb-Peploe 1947), and sometimes in retaliation for raids on poultry farms (D. Mudappa pers. comm. 2014). All mongoose species are traded domestically (Van Rompaey and Jayakumar 2003). The regularity and ease with which the species is seen in various areas amid or close to human settlement suggests that this hunting does not threaten the species. Loss of habitat is a potential threat (Van Rompaey and Jayakumar 2003), however it is unlikely to be driving strong declines at present. The population presumably fell steeply during the main phase of deforestation in the Western Ghats (many decades ago), but rates of clearance are now low, and the species is often seen not just in degraded and fragmented forest, but also in non-forest habitats interspersed with forest fragments.","Stripe-necked Mongoose appears to be relatively common and readily seen in much of the Western Ghats (India) and Sri Lanka (Van Rompaey and Jayakumar 2003, Mudappa 2013); many qualitative statements applicable to particular areas, mostly from before 1970, were presented by&#160;Van Rompaey and Jayakumar (2003).",Stable,"Stripe-necked Mongoose is found only in India and Sri Lanka&#160;(Pocock 1941, Phillips 1984, Corbet and Hill 1992, Van Rompaey and Jayakumar 2003, Mudappa 2013). In Sri Lanka it occurs in both wet and dry zones, including high-altitude areas (Van Rompaey and Jayakumar 2003). In India, it is found particularly in the Western Ghats from Coorg (now Kodagu) southwards. The northernmost records in the Western Ghats are from&#160;Mahabaleshwar&#160;at almost 18°N; an imprecisely located report from Mumbai (Blanford 1888) might refer to point of procurement rather than capture (Punjabi <em>et al</em>. 2014). The known range was considerably extended (about&#160;1,400 km in direct line) to the north-east by a series of records (documented with photographs) from the&#160;Similipal Hills,&#160;in the state of Odisha (Nayak&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014). A historical sight-record from&#160;Horsley Konda in the Eastern Ghats, mostly hitherto dismissed as implausible,&#160;might thus&#160;also be valid (Nayak&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014).&#160;It occurs from the high hills (maximum recorded,&#160;2,200 m) down to the lowlands, being most common between 400 and 1,400 m (Van Rompaey and Jayakumar 2003).","Stripe-necked Mongoose is part of the general offtake of mongooses in India for hair, for use in brush manufacture. There is no evidence of specific trade demand for the species.

45209676,41626,Melogale moschata,Least Concern,,2016,2015-03-03 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"Small-toothed Ferret Badger is listed as Least Concern because of its wide distribution, large populations in anthropogenic environments of large parts of China indicating&#160;high&#160;tolerance to habitat modification,&#160;occurrence in a number of protected areas (probably many and throughout its range), and because it is unlikely to be declining at nearly the rate required to qualify for listing in a threatened category. However, this does not exclude that the species might be at risk in the southern portion of its range. Given the high relative proportion of its total range that is shared with Large-toothed Ferret Badger, it is conceivable that it could be declining fast enough over enough of its range to qualify for Near Threatened or even Vulnerable, but there is no even weak evidence to suggest this. When the geographic and ecological distribution of Small-toothed Ferret Badger in South-east Asia is clarified, it warrants a review of conservation status given that hunting and habitat encroachment are both widespread and locally heavy.","The habitat use of&#160;Small-toothed Ferret Badger&#160;in&#160;South-east Asia&#160;is unclear (e.g. Duckworth <em>et al</em>. 1999). Some certainly located records in Viet Nam and Lao PDR are from within little-degraded evergreen forest (Roberton 2007, Robichaud 2010, Abramov and Rozhnov&#160;2014) but at least in Viet Nam ferret badgers of one or more species occur widely in degraded habitats as well. Given the use of farmland landscapes (with woodland copses) in China (e.g., Wang and Fuller 2003), such anthropogenic landscapes might be used in South-east Asia as well. In China it is also occupies broad-leaved forest (e.g., Zhou <em>et al</em>. 2008).<br/><br/>Small-toothed Ferret Badger&#160;is fossorial and lives in pre-existing holes (including rodent dens, firewood stacks, open fields, and rock piles around houses (Wang and Fuller 2003), rather than digging new ones (Taylor 1989). It is largely nocturnal (Wang and Fuller 2003) and feeds primarily on small animals such as insects, earthworms (Qian <em>et al.</em> 1976, Chuang and Lee 1997), snails, frogs, and sometimes carcases of small birds and mammals, eggs, and fruit (Chian and Sheng 1976, Long and Killingley 1983, Ewer 1985, Neal 1986, Chuang 1994). Resting home range size was found to be 10.6 ha (Wang and Fuller 2003).<br/><br/>Almost all pregnant females were found between March and October during a study on the reproduction of this species on Taiwan (Pei and Wang 1995). Litter size is two, and evidence suggests that it breeds&#160;once a year (Pei and Wang 1995). This species is often found near human habitations (Storz and Wozencraft 1999), taking shelter during the day, and earthworms (the most important part of its diet) are most abundant in the fertile vegetable gardens and farmland soils where this species frequently forages (Wang and Fuller 2003).  It is also sometimes invited into native huts to exterminate cockroaches and other insects (Storz and Wozencraft 1999).","In North-east India the genus is hunted for food (A.U. Choudhury pers. comm. 2007) and this is true across most or all of its range. In southern China this species has historically been one of the most important furbearers and is subjected to heavy harvest pressure (Shou 1962, Sheng 1993, Storz and Wozencraft 1999) and declines have occurred because of this (Lau <em>et al.</em>&#160;2010). However, even in southern China the genus, apparently mostly this species, remains common and widespread&#160;(Lau&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2010). In the northern part of its range, in central China, because this species is perceived neither to prey on livestock, nor cause to damage to property or farm facilities, it is not persecuted, despite its close proximity to people (Wang and Fuller 2003). In addition, the value of an individual pelt is not high, although the meat is eaten in some areas (Wang and Fuller 2003). Also in the Chinese part of its range there seems to be little threat from habitat change, given the species's occurrence in highly anthropogenic environments. Understanding threats further south in its range, where it is or might be sympatric with Large-toothed Ferret Badger, is forestalled by the difficulties of identification to species. Ferret badgers of one or more species are among the most widely camera-trapped small carnivores in Viet Nam, including in very heavily hunted areas where most species are now rare (Willcox <em>et al</em>. 2014); perhaps the species is as resilient in South-east Asia as it is further north.","Small-toothed Ferret Badger in general seems to be relatively common, although this can only be confirmed in areas where it does not overlap with <em>M. personata</em>; this comprises, so far as is known, only a large area of China (including Taiwan). Where it does or might overlap, there are too few properly identified records in the area of sympatry to indicate relative abundance of the two species (J.W. Duckworth pers. comm. 2006). ""Though widely hunted, this resilient species is probably still widespread and relatively&#160;common in many parts of South China"" (Lau <em>et al</em>&#160;2010: 263). There were 238 records of this species from Taiwan between 1991 and 1993 (Pei and Wang 1995). This species is still common on Taiwan although some other carnivores on Taiwan have decreased through widespread deterioration of natural habitat and possibly also intensive rodent control programmes during the past few decades (Wang 1986, Pei and Wang 1995). ""It is a poorly understood species, despite the fact that it seems quite common"" (Wang and Fuller 2003).During a survey on ecology in the village&#160;of Taohong,&#160;northern Jiangxi Province,&#160;southeastern China (about 15 km south of the Yangtze River, at 29º48'N, 116º40'E), 27 records of this species were reported during an 11 month period by Wang and Fuller (2003). Despite the annual average harvest of 40 individuals in an area of about 16 km², which included the study area of Wang and Fuller (2003), this species still seemed rather abundant (Wang and Fuller 2003).",Stable,"Small-toothed Ferret Badger is found in China (central and south-eastern mainland, Hainan and Hong Kong),&#160;Taiwan province of China, North-east India (e.g., Naga Hills), northern Myanmar, North and Central Lao PDR, and Viet Nam (Pocock 1941, Than Zaw <em>et al</em>. 2008, Lau <em>et al</em>. 2010, Robichaud 2010, Choudhury 2013, Abramov and Rozhnov&#160;2014). Occurrence in a large area of Thailand was mapped by&#160;Storz and Wozencraft (1999), but Chutipong <em>et al</em>. (2014) could trace no record from the country. A major southward extension of known range in Viet Nam (Abramov and Rozhnov&#160;2014)&#160;suggests that elsewhere in South-eat Asia, potentially including Thailand, it could also occur many degrees of latitude further south than is conventionally assumed. It is also&#160;likely to occur in southern Bhutan, because there is a record from Buxa Tiger Reserve just south of that country (Choudhury 2013) and there are ferret badger records unidentified to species from the country (e.g., Tempa <em>et al</em>. 2013).<br/><br/>In the wide region of sympatry with Large-toothed Ferret Badger&#160;<em>M. personata</em>&#160;(Myanmar, Lao PDR, Viet Nam,&#160;India, southern China, and&#160;potentially Thailand,&#160;Cambodia, and much of its mainland Chinese range), the continued rarity of use of reliable characters to identify records of ferret badgers to species (most recent potential records lack skulls or did not have the skull characters checked and were not preserved) hinder advances in understanding this species’s current distribution, status or ecology in these regions. It appears that, at least in eastern China, identification by examination of only the teeth may also be misleading (Stefen and Feiler 2004). Pelage characters are, so far as is presently known, unreliable in species-level identification (e.g., Choudhury 2013) so field records, including skin specimens lacking an associated skull, need to be considered as identifiable only to genus. Examination of the baculum in males also allows conclusive identification&#160;(Abramov and Rozhnov&#160;2014)&#160;as, presumably, would genetics.<br/><br/>Most past statements about its altitudinal range are or may be based on identifications from pelage pattern, and thus potentially include&#160;some records of&#160;Large-toothed&#160;Ferret Badger.&#160;There are specimen-validated records&#160;from up to at least&#160;1,500 m (Pocock 1941). At least in China it occurs down to&#160;sea-level.","In North-east India the species is hunted for food (A.U. Choudhury pers. comm. 2007) and this is probably true almost across its range. In Lao PDR, Viet Nam and Myanmar many non-selective methods are used, particularly intensively in Viet Nam and Lao PDR, which catch this species; there is no evidence that it is a specifically desired target. Ferret badgers are eaten and probably used medicinally (J.W. Duckworth pers. comm. 2006). In southern China this species has historically been one of the most important fur-bearers and is subjected to heavy harvest pressure (Shou 1962, Sheng 1993, Storz and Wozencraft 1999); there are now very large numbers farmed in China and the majority of traded animals - it is common in trade in south China - are believed to be of farmed stock (Lau <em>et al</em>. 2010).",Terrestrial,"This species is likely to occur  in many protected areas across its range, specifically the northern part; the paucity of records from&#160;protected areas&#160;in the southern part, where it overlaps with <em>Melogale personata</em>&#160;(e.g., Nakai-Nam Theun NBCA, Lao PDR, Robichaud 2010; Chu Yang Sin National Park, Viet Nam, Abramov and Rozhnov 2014),&#160;perhaps signifies little other than the difficulties of confirming identification to species.

In a&#160;survey of two oil palm plantations in central&#160;Sumatra (where it was the only civet recorded), it was common even in their interior (Jennings&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2015).&#160;Radio-tracking studies have revealed home-ranges of up to 17 km² for males and 1.6 km² for females (Dhungle and Edge 1985, Rabinowitz 1991, Joshi <em>et al</em>. 1995, Grassman 1998). <br/><br/>This species is adapted for forest living, yet it tolerates living in areas near people: commuting along wires and pipes, sleeping in barns, drains, or roofs during the day, and coming out at night to catch rats or forage for mango, coffee, pineapples, melons, and bananas; it also eats insects and molluscs (Lekagul and McNeely 1977, Spaan <em>et al</em>. 2014). It is&#160;crepuscular or nocturnal (e.g., Duckworth 1997,&#160;Azlan 2005). It is&#160;partly arboreal (Payne&#160;<em>et al</em>. 1985) and&#160;the extent of arboreal activity perhaps varies across its range or between habitats: it is often among the most commonly photographed small carnivores by ground-level camera-traps, yet extensive camera-trapping in an oil-palm plantation in East Kalimantan did not record it at all, until camera-traps were placed up trees, when it was found to be common (Wahyudi and Stuebing 2013).","Common Palm Civet is hunted (often a part of general take, using non-selective methods) for wild meat in some parts of its range, such as southern China,&#160;parts of North-east India (especially in Nagaland and hilly areas of Manipur),&#160;Lao PDR, Viet Nam, Thailand and probably throughout northern South-east Asia and widely elsewhere in its range (e.g., Lau <em>et al</em>. 2010,&#160;A.U. Choudhury pers. comm. 2014).&#160;Dead individuals of this species were found with local tribes during a visit to Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu and Agra, Uttar Pradesh in India between 1998 and 2003, where it is killed for its meat (Gupta 2004).&#160;Hunting in Mudumalai Tiger Reserve, India, has apparently much declined (Kalle&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2013), and this&#160;is&#160;probably typical for India excepting the North-east. It is commonly sold in Javan,&#160;and to a lesser extent Philippine,&#160;markets for the pet trade (Nijman&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014, P. Widmann pers. comm. 2014).&#160;It is also persecuted as a pest (e.g., Gupta 2004, Su Su 2005) although it seems able to tolerate very high levels of persecution (e.g. Duckworth 1997). While these pressures are certainly having localised effects on populations in highly fragmented and ‘humanised’ areas,&#160;such as&#160;Houay Nhang (Lao PDR), there is no evidence in mainland South-east Asia of them significantly reducing the population levels in large tracts of natural and semi-natural habitat, even in the heavily hunted countries of Lao PDR and Viet Nam; while in much of India it is a common urban commensal (e.g. Gupta 2004). There has been a recent great&#160;increase in numbers&#160;kept captive for the production of civet coffee, especially in Indonesia (e.g. Shepherd 2012, Nijman&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014) and to&#160;a lesser extent, in the Philippines (P. Widmann pers. comm. 2014).&#160;Large numbers of live Common Palm Civets are traded internationally and when trade confiscations occur, animals are typically released close to site of confiscation. Given that some trade goes from Sundaic South-east Asia to China (e.g. Bell <em>et al</em>. 2004),&#160;it is highly likely that many individuals of one clade/subspecies/species (see 'Taxonomic notes') are being released within the range of another; this has the risk of hybridisation/introgression, or of competitive exclusion (depending on whether the different forms are reproductively isolated; this remains unknown).","Across its wide range, Common Palm Civet is often one of the most commonly recorded species of small carnivore. Across its range it has been found commonly in degraded and anthropogenic habitats,&#160;with some records from even&#160;the most degraded small isolates amid human environments, such as Houay Nhang in Lao PDR and Hlawga in Myanmar. In North-east India and non-Sundaic South-east Asia&#160;it is common in the remote interiors of large blocks of closed evergreen forest, whereas in mainland India (certainly) and in Sundaic South-east Asia (perhaps) it is rare in in such habitat, while still common in degraded and edge habitats (Duckworth 1997,&#160;Esselstyn&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2004,&#160;Su Su 2005, Holden 2006, Belden&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2007,&#160;Mudappa&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2007,&#160;Roberton 2007,&#160;Than Zaw&#160;<span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al</span>. 2008, Holden and Neang 2009, Wilting&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2010,&#160;Low 2011, Chua&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2012, Samejima and Semiadi 2012,&#160;Choudhury 2013, Hedges <em>et al</em>. 2013, Kalle&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2013, Nakashima&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2013,&#160;Coudrat <em>et al</em>. 2014,&#160;Gray&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014,&#160;Kakati and Srikant 2014,&#160;Rode-Margono <em>et al</em>. 2014, Willcox&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014: Table SOM3,&#160;Chutipong <em>et al</em>. 2014, McCarthy and Fuller&#160;2014). In southern China where it is extensively hunted, it is mostly not common, perhaps as a result of decline (Lau <em>et al</em>. 2010), but these areas (Guangxi and Guangdong) also comprise the edge of its range. The recent rapid rise in production of 'civet coffee', a practice using mainly this species, and a new craze for keeping this species as a 'pet' have both presumably resulted in greatly increased off-take from the wild in Indonesia; there is no meaningful information as to the effects of these recent changes (Shepherd 2012, D’Cruze <em>et al</em>. 2014, Nijman <em>et al</em>. 2014). Civet coffee farms are also expanding rapidly in Viet Nam (D.H.A. Willcox pers. comm. 2014). Together with ongoing hunting pressure, particularly in northern South-east Asia, it is likely that the global population is in decline. Given the large areas with only minimal off-take, such declines are at present likely to be very shallow.",Decreasing,"Common Palm Civet has a wide distribution in South and South-east Asia from Afghanistan in the west to Hainan and the adjacent Chinese coast in the east; it occurs widely on&#160;South-east Asian islands, but&#160;the natural pattern of occurrence there is uncertain, given the evidence of introduction by people&#160;(Patou&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2010, Stevens&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2011, Veron&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2015). Animals in Sulawesi and the Lesser Sundas eastwards appear to be introductions, while the Philippine archipelago might have been colonised naturally but also might stem entirely from introductions (Veron&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2015). Its recorded distribution in China is restricted, to Hainan,&#160;southern Guangdong (perhaps based on a trade animal),&#160;south-western Guangxi, much of Yunnan and south-western Sichuan provinces (Wang 2003, Lau <em>et al</em>. 2010). It occurs on the small islands of Bawean (Indonesia), Con Son (Viet Nam), Koh Samui (Thailand), Koh Yao (Thailand), and Telebon (Thailand) (Meiri 2005), and on the Philippine islands of Balabac, Busuanga, Camiguin, Culion, Leyte, Luzon, Marinduque, Mindanao, Negros, Palawan, Sangasanga, Sibuyan (specimens) and Catanduanes, Biliran, Maripipi and Panay (other indications) (Heaney <em>et al</em>. 1998). It is sometimes stated to have been introduced to Japan, but this reflects confusion with Masked Palm Civet <em>Paguma larvata</em> (S. Roy <em>in litt</em>. 2014).<br/><br/>It occurs widely at sea-level; the highest records globally are perhaps those at 2,400 m in North-east India (Choudhury 2013) and in Afghanistan at 2,500 m (Stevens&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2011).","Common Palm Civet is a large part of the general mammal harvest for eating in South-east Asia, both for subsistence but also for trade to urban luxury restaurants. It is increasingly kept as a 'pet' and kept captive for the production of civet coffee, especially in Indonesia (e.g., Shepherd 2012, Nijman <em>et al</em>. 2014).",Terrestrial,"Common Palm Civet is found within many protected areas across its range (e.g. Lao PDR&#160;–&#160;Duckworth 1997; Viet Nam – Roberton 2007, Willcox <em>et al</em>. 2014: Table SOM3; Cambodia – Gray <em>et al</em>. 2014; Myanmar – Than Zaw <em>et al</em>. 2008; Thailand&#160;–&#160;Chutipong&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014; Singapore&#160;–&#160;Chua&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2012; China&#160;–&#160;Lau&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2010; North-east India&#160;–&#160;Choudhury 2013; Borneo&#160;–&#160;Nakabayashi <em>et al</em>. in prep.; Java&#160;–&#160;Rode-Margono&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2014). This species is listed on CITES Appendix III (India).&#160;It&#160;is protected in Malaysia (Azlan pers. comm. 2006), India (on Schedule II part II of the Wildlife Protection Act (2004)), Sichuan, China (Li <em>et al</em>. 2000), Myanmar (Than Zaw <em>et al</em>. 2008) and Bangladesh (under the Wildlife Act 2012; Hasan Rahman pers. comm. 2014), but not in Thailand (Chutipong <em>et al</em>. 2014).&#160;It is listed as Vulnerable on the China Red List (Wang and Xie 2004). Its adaptability to modified habitats (including towns and cities) and resilience in the face of heavy general hunting means that at present no conservation interventions are needed. However, the effects of the recent rapid rise in targeted off-take, for civet coffee and the pet trade, in parts of its range (notably Indonesia) are unknown; surveillance of trade levels and investigation of effects on wild populations are warranted (Nijman <em>et al</em>. 2014).",Indomalayan,,false,false,Global

54013047,61425,Archaius tigris,Endangered,"B1ab(ii,iii)+2ab(ii,iii)",2014,2014-08-11 00:00:00 UTC,3.1,English,"This species is listed as Endangered, because its extent of occurrence is 1,190 km² and its area of occupancy is 45 km², and it is found in three threat locations associated with the spread of invasive cinnamon which is altering ecological function across the landscape. Overall, there is a decline in the extent and quality of its forest habitat, especially on Mahé and Praslin islands, due transformation of habitat by invasive species and for human activities.","<em>Archaius tigris</em> is an arboreal species in found in tropical forest, particularly in forest valley habitats (Gerlach 2008a) but it tolerates altered environments. It can be found in roadside vegetation, rural gardens and secondary forest (Bringsø&#160;2007). It has also been recorded in coconut plantation, eroded hillside scrub, and&#160;primary palm forest (Gardner 1986). Although most observations of reproduction show that the chameleon will dig a hole in the ground to lay eggs (e.g. Gerlach and Gerlach 2002), its reproduction on Mahé is associated with introduced pineapple (<em>Ananas comosus</em>), as it occasionally lays eggs inside the leaf axils (Van Heygen and Van Heygen unpubl. data). Although this strategy has not been observed on Silhouette or Praslin islands, Van Heygen and Van Heygen (unpubl. data) report an <em>ad hoc</em> experiment conducted with one female from Silhouette which, when given the choice between a bromeliad leaf axil and soil, chose the leaf axil to lay her clutch. If this species' natural nesting sites are typically leaf axils, the native host species are not known but are assumed to be the endemic <em>Pandanus</em> and palms (<em>Lodoicea maldivica</em>). <em>Archaius tigris</em> has been reported as occurring in higher densities closer to rivers by some workers (e.g. Gerlach 2008a), where others found no association between proximity to rivers and chameleon occurrence (e.g. Bringsø&#160;2007).","The main threat is habitat degradation as a result of the invasion by alien plants species, especially <em>Cinnamomum verum</em>, principally on Mahé and Praslin. Cinnamon is displacing other vegetation, it is present all over the islands and it is the fastest growing, heaviest seeding plant in most areas (Fleishmann 1999) and is&#160;changing the composition of the forests. Currently it makes up 70-90% of trees in Seychelles forests (Kueffer <em>et al</em>. 2010), reaching &gt;95% in some areas. For <em>Archaius tigris</em>, the cinnamon trees provide a normal structure of vegetation, but the invaded forests support a massively diminished insect population (Gerlach 2008b), somewhere in the region of 1% of normal abundance. This excludes invasive ants which are the only common invertebrates associated with cinnamon. In addition, the cinnamon produces a denser canopy than native trees, giving deeper shade which excludes forest floor undergrowth (other than cinnamon seedlings), and this also is a factor in the reduced insect abundance.&#160;The chameleons are found on cinnamon and in cinnamon invaded areas, as long as there is a wide diversity of other plants and a dense undergrowth. In fact, rural gardens can provide habitat for the chameleons, because these tend to be more diversity in terms of flora, and therefore can support invertebrate fauna.","This species is often cited as occurring at ""comparatively"" low density (e.g.&#160;Pawlowski and Krämer 2012), but a quantitative study suggests that <em>Archaius tigris </em>densities (2.07&#160;±5.00 per hectare) in areas unaffected by the spread of invasive cinnamon trees (<em>Cinnamomum verum)</em>&#160;are similar to that of some other&#160;chameleon species (Gerlach 2008a).&#160;There is a negative correlation between chameleon density and the presence of cinnamon (Gerlach 2008a), suggesting this invasion is detrimental to chameleon populations.",Unknown,"<p>This species is endemic to the Seychelles islands of Mahé, Silhouette, Praslin. A historical record from Zanzibar (Tanzania) is erroneous. It occurs from sea level to 550 m asl, in areas of the islands that have either primary or secondary forest, or in the transformed landscape if there are trees and bushes present. Although they are currently estimated to have a restricted distribution on each island (following survey transects conducted by Gerlach 2008a), if anecdotal observations from transformed landscapes (e.g. degraded areas outside the areas surveyed) are valid, then the distribution would be larger than mapped at present.&#160;</p>","<p>No annual CITES export quotas for <em>Archaius tigris</em>&#160;have been issued between 2000 and 2014 (CITES 2014). Between 1977 and 2013 a total of 12 live individuals were exported from the Seychelles for the pet trade (total of all personal and commercial exports), of which 2 were exported to Germany in 1981 and 10 to Spain in 1993 (UNEP-WCMC 2014). An additional 98 dead specimens were exported between 1981 and 2010 for scientific or zoological purposes, along with a single live specimen in 1982 for scientific purposes&#160;(UNEP-WCMC 2014).&#160;No other trade is reported out of the Seychelles, although re-export of specimens imported to Germany and Spain has been reported to Switzerland and South Africa, respectively&#160;(UNEP-WCMC 2014).

While there are estimated past declines of at least 10% which are expected to continue into the future, and there is continuing decline in the extent and quality of habitat occupied by <em>Leiopelma hochstetteri</em>, none of the thresholds are met for population reduction, population size, EOO or AOO to place this species within a threatened category. This assessment emphasises the need to resolve the taxonomic status of Evolutionarily Significant Units within this potential species complex.","<p>Unlike the three other <em>Leiopelma</em> species, <em>L. hochstetteri</em> is semi-aquatic with a stream-dwelling larval stage, and as such has a higher reliance on the presence of watercourses. This species is found predominantly in native forest, but is also able to survive in modified habitats such as in exotic plantation forests, at least in the short term (Easton 2015). There is a continuing decline in habitat quality e.g. when pine plantations are logged it is likely that streams will be rendered un-liveable for this species due to disturbance and siltation. Mature pine plantations have a slightly lower habitat quality compared to native forests (Easton <em>et al</em>. in review). Furthermore, invasive pigs, goats and deer reduce the quality of native forest habitat for <em>Leiopelma hochstetteri</em> (L. Easton pers. comm. July 2015).</p><p><em>L. hochstetteri</em> has a slightly shorter development period compared to the other frog species native to New Zealand and is estimated to have a generation length of approximately 12 years. It lays small clutches of eggs under stones or vegetation alongside creeks; on hatching, the larvae are active, but do not feed until after metamorphosis (Bell 1985)</p>","<p>Loss and modification of native forest habitat combined with the introduction of non-native predators is likely to have caused the fragmentation of sub-populations seen today in this species.

It is diurnal; activity starts early in the morning and continues on and off throughout the day. It is sometimes seen at night as it is easily disturbed when sleeping, and it may continue feeding after sunset. It sleeps in hollow logs, under buttress roots, or in tangles of vegetation. Burrows in banks may be used in some regions. Each individual has several sleeping sites that are used repeatedly. The diet consists mainly of seeds and fruits; small amounts of plant material and fungi are included when supplies of fruit are low. When food is abundant, it carries seeds away and buries them for future use, depositing each seed in a different place.

Often only one individual may be seen, as members of the pair do not stay in close contact with each other. Pairs maintain territories but are fairly tolerant of other agoutis if food is plentiful. In aggressive interactions, the long rump hairs are raised to form a fan-shaped crest. Females give birth to 1 or 2 well-developed young.

An active forager with omnivorous diet, it even preys on conspecifics (Henderson and Powell 2009).","The major threat is predation by the invasive Small Indian Mongoose, feral cats, and possibly dogs (B. Wilson pers. comm. 2015). The populations on offshore cays face the very real threat of extirpation due to storm surges, likely exacerbated by climate change and sea level rise (B. Wilson pers. comm. 2015).","Seven of the ten mainland subpopulations (in the parishes of Manchester, St. Elizabeth, Westmoreland, Hanover, St. James, Portland, and St. Thomas) are considered possibly  extinct, but it persists on at least four offshore cays (B. Wilson pers.  comm. 2015). There are current records from Kingston, Port Royal, Lime Cay, and Big Pelican Cay, at least (B. Wilson pers.  comm. 2015). Nearly 80 years ago Barbour (1937) reported that subpopulations survived only in urban areas (from which mongoose are excluded by dogs); a similar 'urban survival' effect has been reported for Caribbean skinks on islands colonized by the mongoose (Hedges and Conn 2012). Even within urban areas the species' distribution is likely to be localized; in Kingston it is known to survive at only one or a few localities (S.B. Hedges pers. comm. 2016). The species has not been found in the Hellshire Hills despite intensive survey effort by herpetologists, and is assumed to have been extirpated there by invasive predators (B.

Population estimates suggest that fewer than 1,000 mature individuals remain globally; past population estimates have varied by up to an order of magnitude, and while it is not clear whether this reflects the true magnitude of population fluctuations there may be extreme fluctuations in its population numbers. The persistence of this species is entirely dependent on the continuation of conservation efforts, especially the eradication and continued exclusion of introduced mammals, and habitat protection.","This species occurs in xeric environments such as dry forest, open woodland, coastal scrub, and beaches that are dominated by <em>Coccoloba uvifera</em>. It is associated with leaf litter&#160;and artificial debris. Individuals forage on invertebrates associated with beach wrack. They seek refuge in crab burrows and under logs during the night and the hot part of the day. The species is somewhat adaptable judging by their persistence in a resort area on Protestant Cay (R. Platenberg pers. comm. 2015). It is an egg laying species (Henderson and Powell 2009).","Mongoose (<em>Herpestes auropunctatus</em>) and rats (<em>Rattus rattus</em>) represent a major threat (Henderson and Powell 2009); the former are not present on any island within its range but there is a risk that they may be introduced, which would likely result in the immediate loss of this species from invaded islands (R. Platenberg pers. comm. 2016). Rats are periodically eradicated and reintroduced to these islands (R. Platenberg pers. comm. 2016). The subpopulations on Protestant Cay, Green Cay, and Ruth Island are extremely small in size, and vulnerable to hurricanes, sea level rise, introduction of exotic species and landscape transformation (Hurtado <em>et al</em>. 2014). The latter is the result of both natural succession (on Green and Ruth Cays), with open shrubby areas invaded by grass and dense shrubland that offer fewer opportunities for basking, and artificial landscaping. Protestant Cay is entirely converted for a hotel and its grounds (McNair and Coles 2013), and current landscaping practices involve the removal of leaf litter and other shelter sites (R. Platenberg pers. comm. 2016). This exposes the lizards, which avoid the resulting open areas, to predatory birds. Although one major roosting site for cattle egrets has been removed as a conservation measure to help the lizards, land clearance nevertheless reduces the availability of suitable habitat for the lizard (R. Platenberg pers. comm. 2016).","Several estimates have been made of population sizes on the small cays over the past several years. The total population size of the species is estimated at less than 1,000 individuals (Henderson and Powell 2009, J. Valiulis unpubl. data 2011). The population fluctuates due to management actions and vegetation response to precipitation events (rains cause the open sun spots favored by the lizards to be covered by vegetation); historical population estimates have ranged from around 20 to several hundred (R. Platenberg&#160;pers. comm. 2016, J. Valiulis unpubl. data) but it it is not clear whether this accurately reflects the genuine magnitude of population fluctuation. The species' population is increasing on Buck Island due to the conservation introduction and management of this island, which is a US National Monument (Fitzgerald <em>et al.</em> 2015); conversely reductions in habitat quality elsewhere (R.&#160;Platenberg&#160;pers. comm. 2016) may result in declines.",Unknown,"This lizard currently occurs naturally on Protestant Cay and Green Cay near St. Croix&#160;in the U.S. Virgin Islands.

Its area of occupancy is 191 km<sup>2</sup> using a 1x1 km grid overlay, although the actual occupied area of stable populations is likely closer to 6 km<sup>2</sup>. The population is severely fragmented across Roatán, with the majority of individuals occurring in six isolated subpopulations, as well as on the island of Barbareta. Due to the growing threat of exploitation for local subsistence and tourists, the number of mature individuals is predicted to continue to decline, hence it is assessed as Endangered. Iguanas have been locally extirpated from many parts of Roatán.","Roatán Spiny-tailed Iguanas are found in varying densities in all habitat types across the island including tropical wet forests, mangroves, sandy and rocky shorelines, and anthropogenically-disturbed areas. However, on Roatán they are primarily found in anthropogenically-disturbed habitats such as ecoparks, resorts, and cruise ship docks, due to elevated protection from hunting afforded in these areas (Goode <em>et al</em>. 2016). On Barbareta, they are distributed throughout all habitat types as development is minimal and protection of this private island is presently strictly enforced. This species appears to readily adapt to anthropogenically-disturbed areas as long as they are not exposed to hunting pressure from either humans or invasive alien predators (domestic dogs or cats). They are semi-arboreal, using hollow branches as well as rock crevices as retreats (S.A. Pasachnik pers. obs. 2010, A.B.C. Goode pers. obs. 2012).<br/><br/>Hatchlings are approximately 60 mm snout-to-vent length (SVL); maximum SVL for adult males is 315 mm and 260 mm for females. Maximum age is 15 years, reaching maturity at year three (Rittmann 2007, Pasachnik 2013).","Habitat fragmentation-induced inbreeding and predation by invasive alien species (domestic cats and dogs) threaten this iguana on both Roatán and to a lesser extent on Barbareta. There may also be negligible effects from the threat of this species being perceived as a pest and persecuted (S.A. Pasachnik pers. obs. 2010, Pasachnik and Hudman 2016).<br/><br/>The wide-ranging Common Spiny-tailed Iguana (<em>Ctenosaura similis</em>) has been introduced to a small satellite island, less than 50 m from Roatán. This invasive alien species is known to have dispersed to Roatán and is likely to threaten the endemic iguanas through competition and hybridization; the degree of this threat is currently unknown (S.A. Pasachnik pers. obs. 2010). In 2018, one <em>Ctenosaura bakeri</em>, endemic to the neighbouring island of Útila, was discovered on Roatán. Subsequent surveys discovered several more on a nearby cay (S.A. Pasachnik pers. obs. 2018). The presence of this species also has the ability to threaten the endemic iguanas through hybridization, although the degree is not yet understood.","<p>Total population size on Roatán is approximately 3,760 mature individuals, split into six subpopulations (A.B.C. Goode pers. obs. 2012–2016). However, the number of individuals outside of these high-density subpopulations could not be estimated rigorously given the rarity of animals. Density (calculated using distance sampling along line transects) has declined at monitored sites since 2012. While a decline in local density may be caused by dispersal from the sites, it is likely that any iguana dispersing from within the boundaries of the protected areas is hunted shortly thereafter, as densities outside of these areas are extremely low (<em>ca</em>. 1–5 per km<sup>2</sup>; Goode <em>et al</em>. 2016). One of the high-density areas on Roatán has not been surveyed since 2013, and was previously estimated to contain nearly half of the total population of this species. Without data on the current status of this subpopulation, it is not included in this current population estimate. The population on Barbareta is also unknown, as surveys have not been conducted there since 2010. While the current population estimate shows a level of decline, without information from these known subpopulations, it is not possible to definitively estimate the rate of decline.<br/><br/>The sustainability of each subpopulation on Roatán is based on the cooperation of managers and private landowners who protect each area through a grass-roots movement (Goode <em>et al</em>. 2016). The largest suspected high-density population is found in an area of 0.3 km<sup>2</sup>, but the new property managers have begun allowing hunting and denied access to researchers, so its status is unknown. The current population estimate does not include this location, but surveys conducted in 2012 and 2013 had indicated an estimated population of 3,600 there.<br/><br/>Current genetic diversity within the population is generally low, however, shared genetic characteristics demonstrates historical connectivity. This suggests that these iguanas may have been widespread across Roatán and Barbareta in the past and that modern movement between sites has been disrupted, resulting in genetically-isolated subpopulations. Individuals sampled on Barbareta share a unique genetic makeup from those on Roatán, suggesting an ongoing process of independent evolution in this subpopulation. Further, due to the small population sizes and restricted range, there is evidence of elevated inbreeding within the subpopulations (Pasachnik and Hudman 2016).</p>",Decreasing,"<em>   <p>  </p></em>The Roatán Spiny-tailed Iguana is restricted to Isla Roatán and Isla Barbareta, Honduras, with an extent of occurrence of 294 km<sup>2</sup> measured by minimum convex polygon around both islands. The total area of occupancy using a 1x1 km grid overlay is 191 km<sup>2</sup> (182 km<sup>2</sup> on Isla Roatán and 9 km<sup>2</sup> on Isla Barbareta). This iguana is found from sea level to 300 m asl.<br/><br/>This iguana has also been recorded from Big Pigeon Cay, an islet of Roatán (McCranie <em>et al</em>. 2005), but this was not confirmed on more recent surveys (S. Pasachnik pers. obs. 2010). Similarly, reports of this iguana occurring on Morat, a small island between Roatán and Barbareta, were not confirmed in 2006 (S. Pasachnik pers. obs.). Individuals have been observed on multiple small cays surrounding Roatán, however, it is unclear if these are sustainable breeding subpopulations or vagrant individuals that may have washed ashore or were moved by humans. The names of these cays are often inconsistent, further hindering systematic surveying (S. Pasachnik pers. obs. 2010).<br/><br/>The potential range includes both main islands and surrounding cays. However, on Roatán breeding subpopulations of this species are found primarily in a few isolated locations occupying very small areas. These areas total 0.6 km<sup>2</sup>, and some locations are less than 0.02 km<sup>2</sup> in size. On Barbareta, the species occurs widely over a land area of approximately 5 km<sup>2</sup> (S.A. Pasachnik pers. obs. 2010). This species does not qualify for Critically Endangered under criterion B, because although the known stable subpopulations are found in very small areas, much less than 10 km<sup>2</sup> in total, these patches are spread across the entire island of Roatán and throughout Barbareta, increasing its extent of occurrence.","Hunting for subsistence and for sale to restaurants is a severe threat to this species. Intentional hunting of this iguana is ongoing on Roatán and occurs everywhere they are not actively protected. Hunting pressure has eliminated this species from many parts of the island (Goode <em>et al</em>. 2016). The population is expected to continue to decline if hunting pressure remains at its current level. Development of infrastructure (roads) indirectly affects this species by giving hunters road access to previously inaccessible habitat, as well as exposing this iguana to increased mortality via road-kill deaths.<br/><br/>The Roatán Spiny-tailed Iguana is listed in Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES).

In addition there is national legislation protecting this species but it is not consistently enforced and therefore other conservation measures are necessary to protect these iguanas (S.A. Pasachnik pers. obs. 2010, A.B.C. Goode pers. obs. 2012). There are high-density populations that are protected within privately-owned and managed areas (Goode <em>et al</em>. 2016).

There is significant potential to protect iguanas in additional areas on Roatán and smaller cays through individual landowner grass-roots conservation actions. Invasive alien species should be controlled in protected sites and across the island. Harvesting, and local and international trade of this species should be further researched and managed. To reduce hunting, substituting different protein sources and developing alternative livelihoods should also be attempted within the local communities. Formal education of school children, training of land managers and law enforcement personnel, and general public awareness campaigns need to be instituted.

Effective historical population sizes estimated by Rocha <em>et al.</em> (2013) were much higher for both subspecies (although the methodologies used are not comparable) but exhibited a similar pattern: the southern subspecies had an effective population size around twice that of the nominate form, and the species' effective population size was higher than that for the related <em>P. astriata</em>.",Stable,"This species is endemic to the Seychelles, where it is widespread on several islands. The nominate subspecies occurs on Praslin, Curieuse, Chauve Souris, Round, Denis, and Platte (its presence on Desroches, Marie-Louise and Poivre in the Amirantes Islands is probably due to introductions).

Invasive Yellow Crazy Ants (<em>Anoplolepis gracilipes</em>)&#160;have been observed transporting dead individuals in Praslin's palm forest, where they were first detected in 2009 and had fully invaded by 2018, and are a likely predator on this skink (N.

This excluded the Fregate population, since at the time only&#160;<em>Trachylepis wrightii </em>was understood to occur here.

Although the species is an ecological generalist unlike its relative <em>T. wrightii</em>, it occurs at lower densities when sea birds are absent (Gerlach 2008) presumably due to greater food availability within seabird colonies (J.

The species is found from 100 m to 2,500 m (van Balen 1999), but the recent establishment in Jakarta (van Balen 2019) is near sea-level. Breeding takes place between January and October with a clutch size of two (van Balen 2019).","This is one of or the most numerous species observed for sale in bird markets on Java (Chng&#160;<em>et al.</em> 2015; Chng and Eaton 2016; Chng <em>et al.</em> 2016), and is suspected to be the most frequently trapped species from the wild in Java, and speculated to be the most heavily traded bird species of all (Lim <em>et al</em>. 2019). 2,339 individuals were counted in a three-day inventory of the main bird markets in Jakarta in 2014 (Chng <em>et al.</em> 2015), 526 were for sale in Sukahaji market, Bandung on 4th September 2016 and 3,538 individuals were counted across five markets in central and eastern Java between 22-24th June 2015 (Chng and Eaton 2016). These snapshots indicate that annually the total number caught and traded is exceptionally large, and there is some evidence that the volume of trade has been increasing in the past two decades. A clear increase in volume of trade occurred in the pre-split parent species, Oriental White-eye, on Sumatra, where the pattern of trade is considered to be driven to a large extent by demand on Java (Chng <em>et al.</em> 2018).&#160;A 2018 survey of bird ownership involving over 3,000 households in all six of Java’s provinces additionally estimated that&#160;&#160;136,909 ± 70,163 individuals, and probably a large proportion of c.&#160;1,557,931 ± 379,872 White-eye species are currently kept in Java alone (Marshall&#160;<em>et al</em>. 2020).&#160;Trade volume increased over 300% between 2004 and 2012-13 (Harris <em>et al. </em>2015); while there doesn't appear to be equivalent data on Java itself, this increase is highly likely to have also occurred on Java at a similar time. The species may also be prone to habitat loss and degradation, with only 12,000 km<sup>2</sup> of forest remaining and deemed suitable across Java alone (Akbar and van Balen 2020). However, due to its resilience towards some degree of habitat degradation, any detrimental effects are likely small.","Quantitative population estimates do not exist for this species and, due to the presence of extensive trapping, a total population estimate cannot be calculated from population density estimates. However, the species is described as common on Java and Bali (Eaton <em>et al.</em> 2016).&#160;Weeklong ornithological surveys across 27 sites on nine mountains in West-Central Java between 2018 and 2020 for example found the species at 14 sites and on 7 mountains with a mean encounter rate of 0.39 groups/hour (range = 0.19 to 0.66 where present; C.

On Java the species ought to be one of the commonest birds throughout low to mid-elevations with forest (including secondary), plantations and mature gardens (van Balen 1999). However the impact of very high trapping pressure appears to be that it is very scarce or absent from some suitable areas, and much reduced in abundance across most of the island (Lim <em>et al. </em>2019). However, the species appears to have colonised Jakarta in recent decades (van Balen 2019), likely due to escaped cagebirds adapting to the novel environment. On Bali it may now be restricted to forested uplands and protected areas (eBird 2019).","This species is extensively trapped for the cage-bird trade and is one of or the most numerous species recorded in market inventories (Chng and Eaton 2016, Chng <em>et al</em>.&#160;2015, Chng <em>et al</em>. 2016). 2,339 individuals were observed for sale in Jakarta's bird markets in a snapshot survey in June 2014.

In the absence of continued habitat management and/or predator controls, its area of occupancy, area and quality of habitat, and population size would all likely decline. For these reasons, the species is listed as Near Threatened.<p></p>","In 1949, the remaining populations on Hawai‘i&#160;were restricted to rocky, sparsely vegetated, high volcanic slopes. Historically, the species is likely to have used grasslands, grassy shrublands, and dryland forest (USFWS 2004). It currently occurs in a variety of habitats including golf courses, pastures, lava flows, upland grasslands and shrublands (USFWS). The optimal habitat during the breeding and moulting seasons appears to be lowland grassland, including exotic grassland, where there is an abundance of high protein food, adjacent to natural scrubland nesting areas (Black <em>et al.</em> 1994, Black 1995<strong>, </strong>Black <em>et al.</em> 1997, Leopold and Hess 2013)<strong></strong>. During the non-breeding season it prefers subalpine shrubland (Leopold and Hess 2013, 2014). The species is likely to have originally been an altitudinal migrant, nesting primarily in leeward lowlands below 700m, and moving to montane habitats above 900 meters in the non-breeding season (Black 1995, USFWS 2004). Seasonal movements are now being seen in some recovered populations (USFWS 2004, 2011, Hess <em>et al.</em> 2012). Although a weak flier, the species is capable of flying between islands, and there have been several records of individuals flying between Maui and Hawai‘i&#160;(Banko and Elder 1990). It feeds on a wide range of plants (Banko <em>et al.</em>&#160;1999). It breeds from August to April, with most eggs hatching in December and January (Banko <em>et al.</em>&#160;1999).<br/><p></p>","The species originally declined as a result of hunting by Polynesian and non-Polynesian people, habitat loss and the introduction of mammalian predators (USFWS 2004). Currently the main threats are predation by alien mammal species, habitat loss and degradation, and conflict with humans. Examination of carcasses from 1991-2013 found that emaciation, trauma from predation and road collisions, and diseases (predominantly toxoplasmosis)&#160;were the biggest causes of death (Work&#160;<em>et al.</em>&#160;2015).&#160;<br/><br/>The introduced small Indian mongoose&#160;<em>Herpestes auropunctatus</em>&#160;occurs on all range islands except Kaua‘i, and is the main predator of eggs (Banko 1992, USFWS 2004). Eggs are also predated by Black, Norway and Pacific Rats (USFWS 2004). Dogs, mongooses and occasionally cats predate on goslings (Banko and Elder 1990, Banko 1992). Feral pigs trample nests and predate eggs, young and adults (USFWS 2004). Feral cats also carry the protozoan organism&#160;<em>Toxoplasma gondii&#160;</em>which causes toxoplasmosis, a disease that can be fatal in the species, although it is unlikely to be causing significant population-level impacts (Hess and Banko 2006, Work&#160;<em>et al.&#160;</em>2015, 2016, USFWS 2018)<strong></strong>.<br/><br/>A lack of suitable lowland habitat, especially for rearing young, may be an important factor limiting growth (USFWS 2004). The development of agricultural systems by the Polynesians, and later by European settlers, resulted in the extensive loss and alteration of habitat (Olson and James 1991)<strong></strong>. Lowland habitat continues to be lost through urbanisation and conversion to agriculture (USFWS 2018), and is being&#160;degraded through grazing by feral ugulates (cattle, goats and sheep) and by the introduction of alien plant species such as guinea grass (<em>Megathyrsus maximus</em>), sword grass (<em>Miscanthus floridulus</em>), koa haole (<em>Leucaena leucocephala</em>), and lantana (<em>Lantana camara; </em>Banko <em>et al.</em> 1999, VanderWerf 2012, USFWS 2018).<br/><br/>Road-kills are an important cause of mortality on Hawai‘i&#160;(M.

This also appears to be the habitat in which it breeds (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996)<strong></strong>.<strong> </strong>The species may have been under-recorded in the past because it is very difficult to observe from the shore, since the hidden alcoves of floating vegetation that it frequents are difficult to access during the wet-season floods<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(I.

The species is also threatened by a reduction in the area of <em>Phragmites</em>, which may be due in part to cutting for human use, although this is not well understood and other factors may be involved (Rabenandrasana and Sama 2006)<strong></strong>. Lac Kinkony is highly threatened by the conversion of adjacent unprotected  land into rice paddies, and an estimated 80% of historical reed area  had been lost by 2008, with increased turbidity associated with erosion  the primary contributor to reed loss (Andriamasimanana and Rabarimanana  2011). Contrary to previous fears, the small size of this rail makes it an unlikely target for hunters<strong></strong>, and in some areas at least the species is taboo and the eggs not collected<strong><sup> </sup></strong>( <strong></strong>M. Rabenandrasana <em>in litt</em>. 2003, I. Robertson <em>in litt</em>. 2003)<strong></strong>. Rice cultivation impinges on its native habitat (such as at Lac Kinkony), and the burning of marshland areas by farmers in the dry season also threatens the species, especially when these fires go unchecked<strong><sup> </sup></strong>(M. Rabenandrasana <em>in litt</em>. 2003)<strong></strong>. At the Befojo site, the local fishing industry centred on the lakes may make it less likely that the lakes will be drained for rice cultivation, as is happening to wetlands across Madagascar (I. Robertson <em>in litt</em>. 2003)<strong></strong>. Disturbance by fishermen and people from local villages may pose a threat, and the potential effects of other processes such as hydrological change or the effects of exotic fish or vegetation are uncertain (Rabenandrasana<span style=""font-style: italic;""> et al. </span>2009). Cyclones can be a natural threat, as they disturb the habitat and so the species has to use less favourable habitats, which may expose them to other threats such as dog predation and human disturbance (Rabenandrasana <em>et al. </em>2009).<br/><p></p>","Survey results from 2003-2006 estimated a total of 215 individuals at five key sites, suggesting that the total population may not exceed 250 individuals (M. Rabenandrasana <em>in litt.</em> 2004; Rabenandrasana <em>et al.</em> 2009). However, this may be an underestimate as the surveys were brief and the methods were still being developed, thus the species is not necessarily absent at sites where it was not recorded, and the number of sightings is likely to indicate a larger population (R. Safford<em> in litt.</em> 2004). Therefore, the estimated population range used here is 250-999 mature individuals. The largest single population recorded so far is only 62 individuals (Rabenandrasana <em>et al. </em>2009).",Decreasing,"<em></em><em>Zapornia&#160;</em><em>olivieri</em> is known from several widely separated areas in lowland western <strong>Madagascar</strong>, and is rare and localised. Specimens were taken in 1930 and 1962 (Taylor and van Perlo 1998)<strong></strong>, and all records since have been field sightings: at Lake Bemamba a single bird seen in 1995 (Ramanampamonjy 1995)<strong></strong> and an adult in 1999 (P. B. Taylor <em>in litt. </em>1999)<strong></strong>; two individual adults at Amboropotsy Marsh (near Bekopaka) in 2001 (Willard and Goodman 2002)<strong></strong>; a pair with young and two other adults at Lac Ampandra (near Bejofo-Antanandava) in 2002 (I.

Rabenandrasana <em>in litt</em>. 2003)<strong></strong>.  Surveys of potential sites in western Madagascan wetlands between the  Betsiboka and Mangoky rivers from August  2003 to November 2006 found  the species at five sites: Lac Kinkony, Lac Ampandra, Lac Amparihy, Lac Sahapy and  Lac Mandrozo (Rabenandrasana <em></em><span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>2009). At each site the population was small (12–39 individuals, maximum count of 39 at Lac Amparihy) and the highest density was 20 individuals per km<sup>2</sup>; the total number of birds recorded was 100 and the population at the five sites was estimated at 215 individuals (Rabenandrasana <em></em><span style=""font-style: italic;"">et al. </span>2009). Birds were not recorded at potential sites in the south (Rabenandrasana and Sama 2006)<strong></strong><strong></strong>, where they may be absent or populations may be close to extinction (M.<strong> </strong>Rabenandrasana <em>in litt.</em> 2004)<strong></strong>.  Based on these survey results the population may not exceed  250 individuals<strong></strong><strong></strong>.   This may be an underestimate, however, as the surveys were brief and  the methods were still being developed, thus the species is not  necessarily absent at sites where it was not recorded, and the number of  sightings is likely to indicate a larger population (R.

Several wetland areas where the species occurs, or has occurred, are the subject of planned conservation measures, including Lac Bemamba, Lac Kinkony and the Mangoky River (ZICOMA 1999)<strong></strong>.  There are new initiatives underway and planned for the conservation of threatened wetlands such as the lower Mahavavy River area, including Lac Kinkony (R.

Use GIS analysis to predict population size by extrapolating data into unsurveyed areas (Rabenandrasana and Sama 2006)<strong></strong>. Investigate its ecology, especially its population ecology, year-round (in at least one site, e.g. Lake Bemamba, Lake Kinkony and Lake Ampandra) to identify the causes of its rarity (P. B. Taylor <em>in litt.</em> 1999, Rabenandrasana and Sama 2006)<strong></strong>. Initiate further wetland-conservation programmes, designed in cooperation with local communities, at its known locations (R. Safford<em> in litt</em>. 2003)<strong></strong>. Carry out anti-erosion management in the most vulnerable water catchment areas, and attempt to restore the most severely degraded marshes (Andriamasimanana and Rabarimanana  2011)<strong></strong>.

Global and regional population  trends are difficult to determine, as the species is decreasing in some  range states (sometimes dramatically) whilst increasing in others.  Overall, it is not believed to approach the threshold for the population  decline criterion of the IUCN Red List (i.e. declining more than 30% in  ten years or three generations). For these reasons, it is evaluated as  Least Concern.","In the summer, both maternity colonies and males predominantly occupy  roosts in buildings, such as attics, voids behind sheathing and shutters  etc. It sometimes roosts in ventilation shafts of buildings or joints  in bridges. It prefers summer roosts which offer diverse microclimate,  so that the animals can choose their location according to the outdoor  temperature. Individual, mostly male serotines occasionally use tree  caves or nesting boxes (Baagoe 2001, Simon <em>et al.</em> 2004, Dietz <em>et al.</em>  2009). Nurseries usually consist of 10-60 female, but colonies of up to  300 females have also been reported. Sometimes there are also male  colonies with up to 20 individuals . Serotines hibernate mostly in deep  cavities in buildings at the distance of 40-50 km from a summer roost,  but records from underground sites are also quiet frequent (Dietz <em>et al.</em>  2009). <em>E. serotinus</em> is an edge and open-area specialist. It can glean  insects from vegetation or the ground but the predominant foraging  strategy is aerial hawking (Baagøe 2001). It usually forages around and  in the canopy of trees. In open pastures, it can fly close to the ground  or up to 20 m with sudden steep dives. The species often feeds along  roads and around street lamps. Main prey taxa are associated with  semi-open and open habitats such as meadows and pastures with tree  groups, hedges or woodland edges. The distance to foraging sites can  reach 5–7 km, but usually serotines spend around 90% of their foraging  time at distances smaller than 2 km from the maternity roost. A high  percentage of traditional feeding sites is used by the colonies in  subsequent years Faecal analyses of the serotine bat in different parts  of its European range revealed predominantly Coleoptera (e.g. Aphodius,  Melolonthinae, Necrophorus), Lepidoptera, Diptera, Trichoptera,  Hemiptera and Hymenoptera (see Kyheröinen <em>et al.</em> 2019 for the  review of literature). It is fairly sedentary bat species, with  movements up to 330 km recorded (Havekost 1960). It is known to attain  24 years (Steffens <em>et al.</em> 2007).","In Europe affected by habitat loss and disturbance and destruction of  colonies in houses and in underground hibernation sites. Renovation and  refurbishment of buildings, especially churches, lead to losses of  quarters and roosting possibilities. It also suffers from the  agricultural intensification due to loss of insect-rich meadows and  pastures as hunting grounds through abandonment of free-range farming,  more frequent mowing, increased fertilisation or conversion into arable  land. Loss of hunting grounds due to increased agricultural use (e.g.  through maize cultivation, energy crop cultivation, monocultures and  consequent disappearance of hedges, borders and small-scale structured,  insect-rich cultural and open landscapes is also a significant threat in  developed countries (Simon <em>et al.</em> 2013). The species is at high  risk of collisions with vehicles (Fensome, Mathews 2016). It is  sensitive to light pollution at daytime roosts, commuting routes,  drinking sites and in hibernacula (Voigt <em>et al.</em> 2018).The species  is a host of the rabies-related virus EBLV1. There is increasing  interest in the occurrence, risk to humans and epidemiology of this  virus (e.g. Stantic-Pavlinic 2005), which could have an effect on the  public image of this house-dependent bat.","In the EU, conservational status was favourable only in Pannonian  biogeographical region, whereas it was unfavourable-inadequate in  Alpine, Atlantic, Black Sea, Boreal, Continental, Mediterranean and  Steppic regions  (EEA 2013). At the same time, the stable population  trend was observed in Belarus (Shpak 2018) and Ukraine (Ukraine 2018).  The species obviously extended the range northwards in Russia (Sitnikova  <em>et al.</em> 2009), although its population trend is uncertain everywhere in this country (S. Gazaryan, pers. comm. 2019).",Stable,"<em>Eptesicus serotinus </em>occurs across the Palearctic from Portugal eastwards to Central Asia and Himalayas (Artyushin <em>et al.</em> 2012, Juste <em>et al.</em> 2013, Artyushin <em>et al.</em>  2018). It occurs north up to about 57ºN in Denmark. In the Middle East,  it was recorded from Syria, Israel and Lebanon. Records from the Canary  Islands (Lanzarote) refer to a single vagrant that died shortly after  arrival (Trujillo 1991).

Moreover, the population is at risk of hurricanes and sea-level rise, which may cause the flooding and destruction of key pine forest habitat. The species is therefore listed as Endangered.<br/><p></p>","This         species inhabits all habitat types present on Andros, mostly pine forests and wetlands, and less frequently developed, agricultural and coppice habitats (Rowley <em>et al</em>. 2021). It preferably nests in pine forests of Caribbean pine (<em>Pinus caribeaea</em>) with an&#160;open understory of tall thatch palms, using both pines and thatch palms as nesting trees (Stonko <em>et al</em>. 2018; Yancy <em>et al</em>. 2020). Until recently, it had been assumed that the species depended heavily on anthropogenic, converted habitats and introduced coconut palms (<em>Cocos nucifera</em>) for nesting (Currie <em>et al</em>. 2005; Price <em>et al</em>. 2011; Raza <em>et al</em>. 2020); however this assumption was based on studies focussing mainly on settled areas, leaving pine forests under-surveyed (Stonko <em>et al</em>. 2018). The species breeds between March and August, with a peak in May-July; the nest is an enclosed basket made from plant fibres (Raza <em>et al</em>. 2020).<br/>The species feeds on arthropods, but also takes fruits and nectar and is sometimes seen on nectar feeders in towns (Raza <em>et al</em>. 2020).","The species is facing a variety of threats, including habitat loss, hurricanes and salt water inundation, predation and nest parasitism.<br/> Pine forests are being cleared for agriculture. An increased fire frequency through intentional burning can destroy key thatch palm understory, which is a preferred nesting habtiat, and convert pine forests into herbaceous and fern growth. Being among the most fragile ecosystems in the Bahamas, pine forests may take decades to regrow. Invasive plants may further block out pine forest and hinder regrowth  (J. Antalffy, K. Omland, B. Watson and S. Johnson pers. comm. 2021).<br/>Hurricanes can have severe impacts on the species and its habitat, and their intensity and probably frequency are projected to increase with climate change (see e.g., Knutson <em>et al</em>. 2010; Walsh <em>et al</em>.  2016; Hall and Kossin 2019). Pine forests show considerable storm resilience; however, they are very sensitive to flooding and saltwater inundations, as these can irreversibly damage pine forests (J. Antalffy, K. Omland, B. Watson and S. Johnson pers. comm. 2021). Andros is moreover very susceptible to sea-level rise; a rise of 1 m will lead to a 30% decrease in land area (J. Antalffy, K. Omland, B. Watson and S. Johnson pers. comm. 2021).<br/>Predation by invasive cats, which are widespread across Andros, and  potentially feral dogs, black rats and raccoons are an additional threat  (J. Antalffy, K. Omland, B. Watson and S. Johnson pers. comm. 2021).  Introduced corn snakes are currently not considered a severe threat.  Native Bahamian Racers prey on fledglings on the ground, while the  nocturnal Bahamian Boas climb take roosting birds and access  nests; however, pine tree crowns may be safe from snakes (J. Antalffy,  K. Omland, B. Watson and S. Johnson pers. comm. 2021).<br/>Particularly in developed areas, nests are parasitised by Shiny Cowbirds (<em>Molothrus bonariensis</em>);  about 75% of nests in coconut palms were found to be parasitised, while  parasitism in pine forests is much lower or absent (J. Antalffy, K.  Omland, B. Watson and S. Johnson pers. comm. 2021). Consequently,  planting of coconut palms may be harmful to the species, while the  yellowing disease which rapidly destroys coconut plantations may be  beneficial.","<p>Point count surveys following a distance sampling design in northern North Andros estimated a population of c. 1,200-2,800 mature individuals in the study area (Rowley <em>et al</em>. 2021). The study site included the largest area of pine forest on Andros, which was found to be the species’ preferred habitat (Rowley <em>et al</em>. 2021). These forests may represent around 30-50% of good pine forest habitat present on Andros and may hold a large proportion of the global population, as other pine forests are small, patchy and likely not used as much by the species (J. Antalffy and K. Omland pers. comm. 2021). Tentatively, it is assumed that global population is 2-3 times higher than the estimate for the study site in North Andros (J. Antalffy and K. Omland pers. comm. 2021) and is therefore here placed in the band 2,400-8,400 mature individuals. <br/>The species has been extirpated from Abaco and now only occurs on Andros. Its ability to use a variety of habitats suggests that all individuals may get in contact with each other, and it is therefore assumed that the species forms a single subpopulation.<br/></p>",Decreasing,"<em>Icterus         northropi</em> is         endemic to the Andros group in <strong>The Bahamas</strong>, including North         Andros, South Andros and Mangrove Cay.

Even though the reason for the decline on Abaco has not been fully settled, it is likely that predation by cats played a major role, together with a high frequency of hurricanes of category 3 or higher (S.
